Also at the meeting, outgoing executive officers offered their reflections on the year and advice for their replacements. As of press time, new senators and executive members had not yet taken their positions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany members of Student Lobby said they felt the process did not take into account the requests of the group, despite acknowledging the potential for collaboration and improvement. During public forum, Student Lobby co-chair Maria Flores said she believes issues could be resolved in manner that involve more student input.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We feel that there could be a more inclusive way to go about it,” Flores said. “We don’t negate the fact that student lobby could be changed for the better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrent EVPSA Alex Choate read a letter from the 2011-2012 EVPSA Ahmed Mostafa in favor of the bill, which stated that the bill would help to create a “strong coalition between Student Lobby and EVPSA.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring A.S. President Jonathan Abboud’s report, he defended the bill on the basis that many other UC campuses function with a stronger relationship between the EVP and the Student Lobby group, and that the EVPSA had always picked the chair until two years ago. According to Abboud, the change came as a result of personal vendettas within the association, rather than necessity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The External Vice President used to pick the chair of Student Lobby, and then Ahmed won and they didn’t like him so they changed it,” Abboud said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndre Theus, author of the bill, reported to senate that Student Lobby was unhappy with its unexpected and sudden timing and requested that the bill be pulled. However, he also said he recognized some ways the bill would benefit the organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond-year Student Lobby member Mohsin Mirza said he did not agree with the concept of allowing senators to significantly change a group that they were not directly involved in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a very dangerous precedent for students to restructure something who have not been involved in this,” Mirza said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome Senators said they did not agree with the process of drawing up the bill, but did support the notion of creating a stronger coalition between the office of the EVPSA and Student Lobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenator Nick Onyshko said there should be more consideration for the solidarity of A.S. as a whole.\u003cbr\u003e\n“It’s a little concerning to hear rhetoric such as autonomy…when we are one association,” Onyshko said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bill passed with 12 votes in favor, 6 against, and 4 abstentions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the process of swearing in new executives began, protesters from the Coalition for Survivors silently held up signs condemning administration and campus organizations for allegedly failing to address accusations of sexual assault made by second-year global studies major Crystal Long on April 23 against incoming External Vice President of Local Affairs Beatrice Contreras.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso at the meeting, outgoing executive officers spoke about their experiences in office and offered words of advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbboud advised incoming officials and senators to treat each other with kindness, disregard party politics as much as possible, and keep overarching, long-term goals in mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be mean, don’t be petty towards each other.

Others, though, apparently cannot comprehend how historical power structures relate to comfort level. One white man was quick to blame the discomfort on “fear mongering” within minority communities, rather than suggest any way in which the school could work to make those communities feel safer. Similarly, UCSB’s Take Back the Night organization posted sexual assault statistics on Facebook, and a different white man (wrongly) accused the group of posting misleading statistics in order to scare women.

As a result, an alarming number of people on campus channeled their anger into racism, which one API girl addressed in an op-ed in the \u003cem\u003eNexus\u003c/em\u003e. In her article, she discussed the intersections between racism and sexual assault, and brought up historic police disregard for minority communities. One commenter, rather than asking for more information or even considering that any of her thoughts may be legitimate, instead jumped to assert her wrongness, and claimed police brutality or negligence isn’t a problem at UCSB. The commenter was, you guessed it, a white man — someone who does not belong to any group that has ever received unfair targeting by police and is therefore in no position to contradict the real experiences of underrepresented students on campus.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003eTime and time again in class discussion sections, in talking with groups of friends or on virtual conversations over social media, white men question the experiences of others and insist that they have authority on the matter, when in reality they have no experience or facts to back up their opinions.

Not a single one ever made the assumption that I would not do well based on subconscious presuppositions about success rates of different ethnicities. Not only were my teachers white, but so were the politicians I saw in office, the police I saw on the streets and the faces I saw on my favorite television shows and in my favorite magazines. In school, the majority of the historical figures I studied, the authors I read, the scientists and mathematicians my teachers heralded, were white. Now the majority of my professors and administrators are still white. I am privileged because I have never walked into a store and found myself under constant surveillance by managers who suspect I might steal. I am privileged because I have never been “randomly selected” at an airport, despite having spent a much greater than average percentage of my life on airplanes (I am also privileged enough to be able to travel). I am privileged because when I was 12 years old, I walked past a cluster of police officers with a black friend and could not for the life of me understand why he got scared. He hadn’t even done anything! Now, in Isla Vista, I am privileged because I know that I can look to the police as a source of protection, rather than a source of fear and unfair criminalization. I have privilege because as an undergraduate at UCSB, white students are an overwhelming majority and therefore I never feel alone in my identity. I don’t have to create new spaces on campus in order to find solidarity and support. I am privileged because if I wanted to, I could (like you) go about my life ignoring my white privilege, when people of color must confront prejudice and discrimination on both a personal and an institutional level every single day. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003eLook at me, Tal.

All of my grandparents spoke English as a first language and went to college.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are ways in which you have privileges that I do not, as well. I do not have the privilege of walking alone, or even with other girl friends, at night in my college town and feeling safe, because I am female. Even during the day, I do not have the privilege of walking down the street alone without being harassed, evaluated based on my appearance and propositioned. I will spend my life being called a “bitch” or a “prude” when I turn down sexual propositions and a “slut” or “easy” when I don’t. As a woman in college, I face a one in four chance of being raped, and if that were ever to happen to me, I would not receive institutional support (look at all of the cases at colleges across the country right now), and my peers and the media would make me question whether my actions made me at fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003eYou lay out the privileges that your family didn’t have in their struggle for survival, and that’s all very real, but that doesn’t excuse you from the benefits you get in this society because of your appearance and your identity.

(And by your ilk, I do not mean white men, but arrogant, ignorant, entitled white men who refuse to check their goddamn privilege.) I can only hope that the continued efforts of underrepresented communities and their allies to fight against white male supremacy will eventually ensure that your arrogance becomes irrelevant, rather than a threat to their struggle for liberation.

A portion of the recharge would go toward sustaining the A.S. Pardall center, for which the association has been seeking a permanent funding source, which drew criticism from several BCCs receiving lock-in fees. Additionally, Abboud proposed a reduction in funding for staff salaries, allocating $40,000 less than requested by staff members, which also drew criticism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the concerns brought to the Senate, senators did not change Abboud’s budget except to transfer $3,000 from the senate unallocated fund to tech supplies.

After Lau, OPP’s Guthy and Democratic Process Party’s Kaur spent an hour discussing topics such as campus safety, university affordability, their plans for aiding underrepresented communities at UCSB and their past experience with A.S. and other organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLau’s plans centered on increasing the visibility and transparency of the Associated Students Senate, keeping senators on track with their individual projects and creating new job opportunities for students across various majors in hopes of providing work experience for students facing a competitive job market after graduation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith regards to creating more job opportunities for students, Lau said she would work to build more A.S. entities similar to the A.S. Bike shop but tailored to different majors. As an example, Lau said her first priority would be founding an A.S. Computer Repair shop, where students with technical skills hoping to work with computers in the future could both gain experience and earn money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In this economy … students who go to a four-year university are not able to get a job afterwards,” Lau said. “In the end, experience gets jobs. …What I want to do is really create more student services to create these jobs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen asked what Associated Students means to her, Lau said she sees the association as a means of helping students complete projects and make changes they care about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Associate Students is really empowering students,” Lau said. “It’s something that we use as a tool to complete things that mean something to us. …We are the future, we are students and Associated Students really gives us that avenue to feel like we can make a change on not only this campus … but also the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Lau’s forum, Kaur and Guthy took to the stage in order to answer the audience’s questions in their vie for the presidential office. Kaur has previously worked in the A.S. Office of the President, as an A.S. Senator and as co-chair of Student Commission on Racial Equality, and she currently sits on the board of the United States Student Association. Guthy is currently A.S. Letters and Science collegiate Senator and previously worked as Santa Cruz Hall President and on Community Affairs Board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth candidates named university affordability as their top priority, as they both said there is currently a lack of investment in higher education of the state. Both said they would work to organize lobbying efforts with state legislatures. Guthy added that she, like Lau, would work to create more job opportunities for students as a way of alleviating some of the cost, while Kaur said she would facilitate quarterly swap meets where students would be able to trade books and furniture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs during the other forums that happened this past week, Kaur and Guthy were asked about Deltopia and their thoughts on what happened and who was responsible, in addition to how to move forward and prevent similar occurrences. Guthy said although she could not attend due to a student lobby conference in Sacramento, she felt that a lack of communication between students and law enforcement was largely responsible for the riots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That event shook me,” Guthy said. “I believe that the circumstances that led to the events of Deltopia primarily were miscommunications between students and law enforcement … One potential solution to this is the creation of a police advisory board.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaur agreed that miscommunication greatly contributed to the proceedings, and added that there should have been a town hall beforehand to better prepare the community. Kaur also said she was wary of encouraging an increase in police presence in Isla Vista as a reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t believe that we should really even have more police. I think that police can make certain communities feel unsafe,” Kaur said. “I wouldn’t blame the police either for the events that happened, but I think we need more communication … I do believe that we should be policing the police, in fact.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne area in which the candidates did not agree involved UCSB’s membership status on the United States Student Association. According to Guthy, UCSB currently pays $10,000 per year to be a part of USSA, in addition to the $150,000 a year to be a part of University of California Student Association. A bill has recently been presented to the A.S. Senate that would withdraw from USSA on account of finances. Guthy said she felt strongly that USSA is an important organization and network for students across the nation, but she said UCSB would still be involved in USSA through its UCSA membership and did not think it was worth paying the additional $10,000 to USSA each year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Membership in UCSA gives us membership in USSA … so withdrawing from USSA does not mean we are not members; it means we are no longer direct members,” Guthy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaur, who sits on the Board of Directors at USSA and who has attended every USSA conference since her second year, said she believes the association has been the “most empowering organization” of her life. According to Kaur, while UCSB would still technically be involved through UCSA, it would no longer be able to send a delegation to the conference each year, and therefore she opposed withdrawing membership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“USSA is one of the most important organizations in this nation. Student power can move mountains,” Kaur said. “As a board member of USSA, I actually have to say that even though we would be members through UCSA, there would no longer be a UCSB delegation, and that is a shame.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen asked why each candidate chose their respective parties, Guthy said she chose OPP due to its track record of creating tangible change, citing the grants they pushed for and received for increased lighting in I.V., the expansion of campus wifi and a letter-writing campaign to legislatures lobbying to stop cuts to the state budget that drew over 11,000 letters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was particularly drawn to this party because we have a history of creating tangible change on this campus that directly benefits students. … As president, I want to continue that legacy,” Guthy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaur also praised her party’s tangible accomplishments, notably the A.S. food bank, and the textbook marketplace and added that she chose DP because she saw a strong DP presence throughout the year across multiple important campus organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are the party you will see year-round, regardless of elections. … We are the students who have been there, [who] have been at the front lines of change since day one of their experience here,” Kaur said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last question posed to candidates before their closing statements prompted them to describe how they had worked to aid underrepresented communities at UCSB. Guthy said she acknowledged that she comes from a position of privilege, but that she has worked for underrepresented communities through Swipes for the Houseless and would continue to educate herself and reach out to those communities as president.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t identify with a lot of communities who feel that they are underrepresented on this campus — I acknowledge this,” Guthy said. “I really want to work by collaborating with [and] working for a future that, we all as Gauchos … can all work towards. … As president I will continue my work and outreach.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaur listed the several organizations she has been involved with since coming to UCSB that work to serve minority students, and said she would continue doing everything within her power to fight for the underrepresented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I, coming in, was struggling with my identity as an Indian woman,” Kaur said. “It really opened my eyes to how institutions in this country really oppress certain people and give privilege to others. … I continue to learn and educate myself. … I believe it begins with education.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth candidates closed the forum by asserting their passion and drive for the UCSB community and Associated Students.

Members of the Elections Committee moderated the debates, fielding questions from audience members to the candidates and touching on topics related to a candidate’s core values and party ties, as well as their opinions of existing projects and practices within A.S.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEVPLA Debate\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the position of EVPLA, which deals with community affairs in Isla Vista and Goleta, OPP’s Beatrice Contreras debated with DP’s Daniela Bayon. Contreras has worked as an Off-Campus Senator for the past year, while Bayon has been heavily involved in Isla Vista Community Relations Committee and has worked to develop a landlord-rating website that is expected to go online later this quarter. The two candidates professed similar agendas, proclaiming their determination to focus on sexual assault and hate crime prevention, housing fairness, communication with law enforcement and community centers in Isla Vista, among other issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen asked about increasing safety in Isla Vista, Contreras said she would set up a board of students that would keep close contact with police and foot patrol in order to keep students both informed and included in law enforcement decision-making.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There needs to be a lot more communication with Isla Vista Foot Patrol, and one thing I have as a specific platform is to create a law enforcement advisory board so that we can all sit down and talk about what our community policing priorities are,” Contreras said. “We can have students, non-students, community members and police officers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContreras also advocated implementing a rape crisis center in Isla Vista. Bayon, in her answer to the same question, proposed creating a legal complaint coordinator, in addition to a center in I.V. for those who felt harassed or assaulted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One of the biggest issues with safety in Isla Vista is issues dealing with women and men — all folks — on sexual violence,” Bayon said. “This space will be a space for all students and survivors of sexual assault to go and have a safe space on Friday nights and on Saturday nights.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn regards to Deltopia, which drew in roughly 10,000 more people than last year based on County officials’ estimates, Bayon said that while she agreed with increased efforts for open communication with law enforcement, she also said some communities do not feel safe working with police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayon and Contreras differed slightly on their opinions of the proposed fee increase for renovations to the University Center, called the Student Union Revitalization Fund. While Contreras said she fully supported the fee, Bayon said she believed more work needed to be done on the project before the fee was passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Contreras, budget constraints on the university mean that students have no choice but to fund the project themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I definitely do agree with the UCen lock-in fee,” Contreras said. “Although it’s a shame and we shouldn’t have to raise student fees, it’s important to be faced with the reality that there are budget cuts going on … we really need to work with what we have … we need to provide those services for ourselves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Bayon, before the SURF fee passes, the people in charge of the project should work with a larger number of student groups to devise a more universally beneficial plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve heard a lot of different mixed feelings from a lot of community members and a lot of students and a lot of BCCs on campus,” Bayon said. “I think that this UCen lock-in fee needs more work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen asked to explain the ways in which they had worked to support students of color and queer students on campus, Bayon said she has consistently been an advocate of inclusive language, expanding safe-zone training to police and residence halls. She also mentioned her earning of a Gender and Diversity requirement, rather than a European Traditions requirement, while Contreras said her efforts include advocating for a Gender and Sexuality general education requirement. Both candidates cited their experiences as women of color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the EVPLA debate, Bayon stressed the Rate My Landlord project as one specific goal she hopes to accomplish by both getting the site running and setting up a system for it to continue in future years. On the other hand, Contreras talked about developing a community center in Isla Vista that would serve both students and non-students alike, although A.S. just recently launched a similar project called the Pardall Center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEVPSA Debate \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second debate last night pitted OPP’s Melvin Singh against DP’s Kashira “Kash” Ayers for A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs, which deals with statewide issues in higher education, such as UC budget cuts, and student lobbying and organizing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuestions focused on the appointment of Janet Napolitano, the United States Student Association, the California Master Plan for Education and its revision project, plans for working with other UC campuses, collaborations with legislators, the California budget for education and party alignment. The candidates come from different backgrounds, with Singh having worked with Student Lobby and the Office of the EVPSA, and Ayers holding experience in organizing and lobbying with the Black Student Union.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen asked about UC President Janet Napolitano, both candidates said they had a problem with her appointment, although they differed in their approaches to moving forward with her. Ayers said she would focus on organizing student talks with Napolitano.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would like to acknowledge that I do have a problem with the appointment of Janet Napolitano,” Ayers said. “As students at this university, we should have a say in who our UC president should be. … As EVPSA, I will work with her in hosting forums that are open to all students.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSingh said he would continue ongoing negotiations with Napolitano, saying he felt optimistic based on her reception to past demands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t approve of Janet Napolitano’s past … however, she is in the position right now where she is a public figure,” Singh said. “Compared to past UC presidents, she is more of a politician and more indebted to our needs. … She’s been very receptive since her appointment. I’ve seen her engage with students, and I hope to continue that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen asked about the first issues the candidates will tackle if elected, Ayers said she would focus on voter registration and organizing forums for students who are unable to vote, while Singh said he would focus on securing stable costs tuition and preventing another tuition hike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen asked about the state of the United States Student Association, Ayers and Singh both said it can be a powerful tool for student lobbying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As students, we have power in numbers,” Ayers said. “USSA is effective because it builds a strong coalition of students that can network inside of these spaces and outside of it …We need to get more students there, especially first- and second-year students.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the California Master Plan for Education, Singh said he supported efforts to revise the Master Plan based on a changing context for California.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The problem with it now is that it’s not clearly defined for all students,” Singh said. “I’m totally supportive of pushing the Master Plan across California … I’m very optimistic about it, and it’s something I will back up as EVPSA.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eModerators asked candidates which aspects of the budget each candidate would focus on advocating for, given current budget constraints. Ayers said she would focus on increasing financial aid, increasing diversity on campus and allocating more money towards resources for students such as psychological services. Singh said he would focus on affordability and accessibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth candidates were asked why they chose to run with their respective parties. Ayers, although maintaining that she does not believe in party lines, named several factors that drew her to the Democratic Process Party. In particular, she mentioned the fact that DP has an open, democratic primary for electing candidates while OPP does an interview process to select individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Parties can be abrasive sometimes, but I chose the Democratic Process Party for the simple fact that they have an open primary,” Ayers said. “It’s issue-oriented and action-based, and it’s a progressive party,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSingh said he chose to run with the Open People’s Party mainly based on its means of achieving policy goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“OPP happens to have the methods and the actions that I agree with, when it comes to enacting the opinions that I have,” Singh said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSAG Debate\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third and final debate of the evening occurred between Bailey Loverin and Amir Khazaieli, independent candidates for Student Advocate General.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoverin has worked for the past year as the Chief of Staff in the current Office of the Student Advocate (OSA), while Khazaieli has sat on Senate for the past two years as the collegiate senator for the College of Engineering. Debate questions touched on how each candidate would balance transparency and confidentiality, restructure the office, resist conflict with personal interest, combat sexism and racism and plan for student outreach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn terms of its structure, the OSA currently has the SAG, a Chief of Staff and four divisional departments — each with two caseworkers. The departments at present are housing, academic, public interest and student conduct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf elected, Loverin said she will replace one of the caseworkers in each department with a program director responsible for outreach efforts. She also said she will add a program director at the level of Chief of Staff. Meanwhile, Khazaieli said he plans to first hire entry-level fellows who are not initially affiliated with a specific department but do casework. Khazaieli then said he will add a position in charge of transparency at the level of Chief of Staff and alter the divisions to be on-campus housing, off-campus housing, campus policy and non-university legal issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding issues of sexism and racism, Loverin said she will increase the role of the public interest division, which serves to help and support student groups and is a department added in the office just this past year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to push them to work with S.C.O.R.E. and other campus organizations that deal with these issues,” Loverin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Khazaieli, more work needs to be done in regards to discrimination and efforts should be completed in collaboration with A.S. groups.

A discussion ensued to determine whether or not to correct the mistake — despite SJP members’ understanding that they would still receive the money — with the final decision culminating in taking back the funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore discussing the SJP fund issues, however, Executive Officers presented to the Senate the work their offices have been doing in light of the “civil unrest” that occurred Saturday evening of Deltopia, with senators later discussing potential strategies to prevent such occurrences in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA.S. President Jonathan Abboud devoted most of his speaking time to the matter of Deltopia and its repercussions. Abboud said the events were distressing, with bottles and rocks thrown at police personnel and then the police responding with tear gas and rubber bullets. However, he said A.S. reacted quickly to the incidents and that their response was well received by the general public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The cool thing is that we were the ones sending out the message and not the university, so Associated Students was ahead of the game,” Abboud said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbboud also said most officials seemed open to working with students. In a meeting he attended with External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore and all of the Senior Officers of the university, he said officials looked to find a solution with the students rather than seeking to enact harsher restrictions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We discussed just kind of what happened that weekend, and the tone of the conversation was surprisingly pro-student, and not, ‘Let’s just crack down,’” Abboud said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbboud said there would be a committee set up to assess the cameras that appeared in Isla Vista just before Deltopia, and he confirmed to Senators that the cameras were paid for by the university and were intended for temporary use only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudent Advocate General Kristian Whittaker also spoke about Deltopia during his report to the Senate. According to Whittaker, the most pressing issue for his office since Saturday has been that some students have been told by police that they could be evicted from their homes or expelled from UCSB based on their participation in the civil unrest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhittaker said students can only be expelled if they engage in an act that “indicates a breach of the student code of conduct.” Eviction, he said, depends on specific lease agreements and would be left to the discretion of the landlord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoore’s report discussed the reasoning behind requesting an investigation from the Civil Grand Jury on Saturday night’s events. Moore said he and other officers felt it was important to request a third-party investigation since no such circumstances of riots, tear gas and other events came up during previous Deltopias. Moore said he hopes the investigation can shed new light or a different perspective on the incidents that occurred last Saturday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At the end of the day, we don’t have the answers … We’re looking to the Civil Grand Jury because it’s a fresh set of eyes,” Moore said. “We’re not looking to accuse anyone of anything, we’re just looking for answers, because we’ve had Deltopia for, what, a decade, and this is the first time this has happened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenators proposed potential actions that the community can take in order to prevent future events from spinning out of control. Ideas suggested included enacting parking restrictions, blocking entrances to I.V. or making Deltopia an official, sanctioned event that could potentially make it easier to regulate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter finishing the discussion about Deltopia, Senators went through details of the broken financial code in funding SJP. What initially occurred in the previous meeting was that the Student Commission On Racial Equality (SCORE) decided to allocate $250 for SJP for the group to transport a wall of photographs to the school. However, because SJP already received transportation funding earlier in the year in order to attend a conference, SCORE’S allocation broke code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Senate approved the allocation in their previous meeting, however, they had the power to choose not to correct the error and allow the group to keep the funding. A debate ensued on whether or not they should revisit the previous meeting’s minutes and correct the mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn-Campus Senator John Pena-Soriano said he felt Senators should allow the mistake to pass since the group had been operating under the assumption that they would receive the funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It seems like it’s really on us,” Pena-Soriano said. “I feel that it’s unfair for us to take away their funding now that we approved it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff-Campus Senator Derek Wakefield disagreed with Pena-Soriano. Wakefield said he did not have anything against the group or their reason for requesting funding, but he said he felt that Senators should abide to the legal code regardless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have to follow policy, otherwise there’s no point in having policy in the first place,” Wakefield said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, Senators voted to strike the funding from SCORE’s minutes, thereby revoking their previous approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis story is a \u003cem\u003eDaily Nexus\u003c/em\u003e online exclusive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"\u003e\u003ci class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003ePrint\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"sd-title\"\u003eShare this:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"sd-content\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-facebook\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/a-s-senators-discuss-deltopia-misallocated-funding/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-twitter\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/a-s-senators-discuss-deltopia-misallocated-funding/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-tumblr\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/a-s-senators-discuss-deltopia-misallocated-funding/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-reddit\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/a-s-senators-discuss-deltopia-misallocated-funding/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-end\"\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRelated\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e          \u003c/div\u003e","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/a-s-senators-discuss-deltopia-misallocated-funding/","id":3027,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3026,3025,3024],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Its architect, Jeff Shelton, came during Public Forum to discuss the proposed plans with senators and shed light on the development process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelton approached senators in order to explain the development process for the Nest, which has already garnered student criticism. He also sought to relay his desires as an architect to create a space that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional for I.V. residents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Shelton, the building has been in the works for a significant amount of time and is part of the Isla Vista Master Plan, a project designed to complement the Countywide Comprehensive Plan and Goleta Community Plan and meant to address improvements to housing, transportation, infrastructure and other aspects within the I.V. community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The planning department wants it denser in Isla Vista,” Shelton said. “They want to get more housing — more variety of housing — and the Master Plan shows this area being built up … It happens to be at probably the best corner of town here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelton said the Nest will provide affordable single unit housing, rentable hotel space and commercial space in a way that fits with the existing community while also living up to environmentally-friendly ideals. Furthermore, Shelton said he sees this task as part of his duty to the community to keep the space lively and exciting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My goal as an architect is to try to make it work in the community,” Shelton said. “Now, the community is not all built up yet, so you kind of have to look ahead to make it work … I’ve got to keep it livable and interesting for the community at that street.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenators expressed concern about the way the proposed development would affect property values and local businesses. However, Shelton was unable to fully respond to these concerns since his involvement lies solely within the architectural designing aspect of the building development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing Shelton, Public Relations Specialist for UCPD Ariel Bournes came to update Senators on the steps the police department are currently undertaking in order to address both the sexual assault and general safety concerns in Isla Vista. Bournes cited increased video surveillance, increased staffing and patrolling, increased presence of Community Service Officers and continuing conversations with Chancellor Henry T. Yang about how to best protect UCSB students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s an all hands on deck situation at the police department,” Bournes said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater in the meeting, Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) Co-Chair Kaitlyn Christianson expressed her thoughts on the revised food bill. She said she felt satisfaction toward the revisions incorporated; however, she hopes that in the future the Senators will take a more inclusive approach toward the campus Boards, Commissions and Committees (BCCs).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristianson said much of her discontentment with the previous version of the bill was because it attempted to limit the amount of money each BCC spends on food yet did not initially take into account the different sizes of BCCs and the ways in which the groups use food differently, amongst other issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s very easy for Senate to figure out what Senate needs,” Christianson said. “But BCCs are so diverse … and we’re considered from the outside, which is the biggest problem I think.

Yang made a surprise appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A Resolution to Mandate Warnings for Triggering Content in Academic Settings,” urges university officials to require professors who present content that may trigger the onset of symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) to warn the students ahead of time and refrain from docking points from those who opt out of attending class that day. The resolution also directs A.S. executives to bring the proposal to the attention of the UC Student Association board and the Academic Senate and asks that the office of the Student Advocate General appoint a staff member to devise a list of trigger warnings. Also at the meeting, Chancellor Yang appeared to deliver letters to each of the senators, in which he declared his determination to take action as a result of the sexual assaults that occurred over the weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong other promises, Yang stated there will be increased lighting around the UCSB lagoon and more Foot Patrol and Community Service Officers in Isla Vista, in addition to increased staff in the counseling and advocacy services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBailey Loverin, chief of staff for the Student Advocate General and student sponsor of the resolution, cited her personal experience sitting through triggering content as her reason for writing the resolution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tonight I am coming to you…first as a student, second as a woman and third, as a survivor of sexual abuse,” Loverin said. “Two weeks ago, I sat in class watching a film screening and felt forced to watch two scenes in which the instance of sexual assault was insinuated and one in which an instance of rape was graphically depicted … there was no warning before this film screening … and it was incredibly difficult to sit through.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoverin said although she did not want to sit through the film, it was more difficult to walk out during the movie and draw attention to herself. She said the resolution was intended to aid students who had experienced trauma and retained symptoms of PTSD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“[The resolution] recognizes that trigger warnings are symptoms of PTSD and UCSB Disabled Students Program recognizes PTSD as a disability,” Loverin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Loverin also said that the resolution is not asking for the removal or censorship of any triggering content, but rather better consideration of victims of sexual assault and PTSD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is not meant to censor … but it really just asks that professors and other people on campus acknowledge the effects of triggering content on students with PTSD,” Loverin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the Senate eventually passed the resolution, On-Campus Senator Nikki Calderon said all of the senators should do everything in their power to ensure university officials are aware of the request and Off-Campus Senator Beatrice Contreras added another note of support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been in this kind of situation before — it sucks; we should pass it,” Contreras said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, A.S.

President Jonathan Abboud presented his ideas to chairs and co-chairs of A.S. Boards, Committees and Commissions, or BCCs, after completing a revision of another restructuring plan, which was presented at the last BC4 meeting. In the revised restructuring plan, A.S. would no longer be divided into BCCs, and instead the Association would be divided into Senate Standing Committees, Senate Administrative Committees, Units and lastly, Boards and Commissions. Thus, current groups — or BCCs — would be placed into one of these categories according to their function or issue of focus; for example, the A.S. Bike Committee would be considered a Unit. This new organization of BCCs makes for increased involvement of the A.S. Senate through several different implications and changes — such as one change to the electoral process for selecting BCC chairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently, BCCs have primary control over the selection of their leaders: the majority of groups have an internal election and then forward the names of elected officials to the A.S. president and Committee on Committees, which fills out the necessary paper work. The A.S. president gives a ‘rubber stamp’ approval of the decision and Senate ratifies it, but the Senate does not play a major role beyond this brief approval process. In the new restructuring plan, Abboud proposed that members of Senate and the Executive Board be part of the process of selecting the incoming board members of each group. In this process, two members of the group and the outgoing position-holder would remain as voting members. However, many chairs felt that this proposed process would jeopardize their ability to function independently and as best as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriday’s presentation, which also included the participation of Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Michael Young, was generally met with extensive questioning and criticism, as many BCCs were skeptical of its effects on their autonomy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbboud, along with senate Pro-Tempore Ali Guthy, used a PowerPoint presentation to show how they planned to change the structure of Associated Students. Abboud prefaced the discussion with a plea for civility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been disappointed with how negative things have been,” Abboud said. “Let’s just try to be constructive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile most attending BCC chairs were not enthusiastic about any aspect of the presentation, the most contentious issue was the proposed change to the selection process for chairs and board members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnisha Ahuja of Human Rights Board said she did not “understand how cutting the amount of voting members” would be beneficial to the selection process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Co-Chair of Take Back the Night — a sexual assault awareness group — Kelty Kauffman, her organization’s mission is to create a safe space for sexual assault survivors; thus, it is important that the selection committee be well versed in the field. With the current process, Kauffman said the group is able to follow this mission and she rejected the idea that such a selection process may result in unfair exclusivity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take Back the Night is such a sensitive space and it is considered a safe space for survivors … it’s not so much a cliquey thing it’s about choosing people who are sensitive to the issues at hand,” Kauffman said. “I personally think that there are people in the past who have been involved who have not been sensitive to the issues at hand. Picking people who are heavily involved … is not being cliquey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral members of Program Board were present at the meeting to voice their concerns about the restructuring plan. One member said he felt creating a uniform process for appointments of new board members was inherently ineffective because “BCCs operate at different levels and operate in different ways.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbboud defended the inclusion of senators in appointments, as a way of instituting “checks and balances” and for senators to be more informed of the process, so that when it came time to approve the appointments in Senate, they would know what they were approving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They have to be present so they know what’s going on [and] they’re not making uninformed votes,” Abboud said. “What I’ve seen for four years in A.S. is every time appointments go up … they kind of just pass … what if there’s a problem?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKyle Trager, general manager of KCSB — which would be exempt from the addition of senators in the selection process, as KCSB is an entity of the press — still took issue with the need for a change in the selection process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Should it not be the job of the president and the non-student staff of A.S., who have an institutional memory, to really push the senators to be proactive?” Trager asked Abboud and Guthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbboud responded that he has “no authority over the Senate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbboud and Guthy eventually agreed to scrap the idea of the selection process and take the concerns of the chairs into consideration; however, many were still unsatisfied with the restructure as a whole. Hani Tajsar, of Student Commission on Racial Equality, said he felt Abboud was “trying to fix imaginary problems,” and Mohsin Mirza of Student Lobby said “a one-size-fits-all solution might not be the best idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow, Guthy said that grouping BCC according to the new categories outlined will make for a more efficient and fair process that does not infringe on any organization’s individual autonomy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing about the restructure will change the way that these groups function,” Guthy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbboud and Guthy plan to revise the restructure plan once again and bring it back for yet another discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the restructuring plan, BCCs discussed a bill recently passed at A.S. Senate regarding food budgets, presented on-going projects and engaged in a question-and-answer with Vice Chancellor Michael Young.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking at the meeting about his opinion of A.S. as a whole, Vice Chancellor Young said no one could better represent and advocate the needs of the student body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even though people like me truly do care about you — I work for your best interests — in many ways, you are the best protectors of your interests,” Young said. “I can’t speak for students … the vast majority of the presidents that I’ve had the pleasure and opportunity to work with have done just that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA version of this story appeared on page 1 of Monday, February 3, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"\u003e\u003ci class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003ePrint\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"sd-title\"\u003eShare this:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"sd-content\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-facebook\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53842\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/a-s-debates-possible-internal-restructuring/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-twitter\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53842\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/a-s-debates-possible-internal-restructuring/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-tumblr\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/a-s-debates-possible-internal-restructuring/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-reddit\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/a-s-debates-possible-internal-restructuring/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-end\"\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRelated\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e          \u003c/div\u003e","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-03/a-s-debates-possible-internal-restructuring/","id":3038,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3037,3036,3035],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Recent Food Bill Dominates A.S.

Senators Andrew Neiman and Jimmy Villarreal authored the bill in order to combat “excessive expenditures on food at meetings,” and stipulated that groups will only be able to spend money on food for events or programs, quarterly banquets and meetings with attendance exceeding 75 people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird-year sociology major Navkiran Kaur, who sat on the senate last year, was the first student to present at public forum in opposition to the bill. According to Kaur, restricting food budgets will hurt low-income students who depend on free food from the organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A lot of students, with their meetings and classes and all the things that they do, don’t even have time for meals and I think it’s the least A.S. can do with their own student fees to provide a couple of snacks for students during meetings,” Kaur said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile saying it is “really inappropriate” to limit food, particularly for low-income students, Kaur called the bill “classist” and said it “definitely screwed over a lot of students who depend on these meals.” She also brought up the question of whether or not the bill would affect the A.S. Food Bank, whose specific goal is to provide food for those who cannot afford it otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral members of A.S. Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) also came to public forum in order to contest the bill. One member discussed the bi-quarterly dinner that C.A.B. provides for children of UCSB students, saying they wondered if the organization would still be able to provide it with the restriction. PR Coordinator Kari Newman said 75 to 90 percent of new members come to meetings for the food, and that C.A.B. even uses the hook “great food, great friends” while tabling to attract participation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCo-chair Kaitlyn Christianson, who also sat on the senate last year, echoed the idea that food was a main attraction for participation at meetings. She said although students may initially come for the food, they oftentimes find opportunities for community involvement and actually take part in campus organizations. Additionally, Christianson made the argument that since C.A.B. uses the Isla Vista Food Co-op for food, the money they spend goes back towards the community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenators did not devote much time to discussing the food bill, however they did establish an ad hoc committee to look into the concerns that were presented at public forum. Senator Arezu Hashemi said she acknowledged the necessity of discussing the bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think that this is a good discussion to have,” Hashemi said. “If we want to talk about it on our own, I think that we should make an ad hoc for it — that way the BCCs can get involved.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the Bills and Resolutions portion of the meeting, senators passed changes to the A.S. Elections code. Last year, changes to elections code consumed the senate for weeks, resulting in meetings that lasted 10 to 12 hours, during which senators debated, voted, were vetoed by the A.S. President and then voted to overturn the presidential veto. This year, elections code passed by consent, meaning that not a single senator objected to the changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most significant changes to the elections code include allowing independent candidates to spend an additional $100 on their campaigns as compared with last year, and extending the recruitment period for elections from two weeks to three weeks. Otherwise, the code remains relatively unchanged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso at the meeting, Executive Officers delivered reports during which External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Alex Choate reported on the progress being made towards establishing more online courses, and Senators passed a bill establishing an official A.S. logo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis story is a Daily Nexus online exclusive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"\u003e\u003ci class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003ePrint\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"sd-title\"\u003eShare this:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"sd-content\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-facebook\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53817\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-31/recent-food-bill-dominates-a-s-senate-public-forum/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-twitter\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53817\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-31/recent-food-bill-dominates-a-s-senate-public-forum/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-tumblr\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-31/recent-food-bill-dominates-a-s-senate-public-forum/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-reddit\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-31/recent-food-bill-dominates-a-s-senate-public-forum/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-end\"\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRelated\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e          \u003c/div\u003e","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-31/recent-food-bill-dominates-a-s-senate-public-forum/","id":3040,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3039,3038,3037],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The resolution was first introduced during last week’s meeting and then tabled until yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe resolutions’ demands for Napolitano included holding mandatory trainings for UCPD on the rights of undocumented students’ and other underrepresented groups, having UC staff training on the issues that undocumented students experience and supporting the Trust Act, which Governor Jerry Brown recently signed into law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral audience members who spoke at Public Forum had also attended last week’s meeting and reiterated their reasons for supporting the resolution. Anisha Ahuja and Katlen Abu Ata issued a prepared statement on behalf of A.S.

We work to pressure the University to uphold these standards and qualities of fair and equal treatment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGloria Campos of UCSB IDEAS said passing the resolution would show solidarity with other UC campuses that have already passed similar resolutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Passing a vote of ‘no confidence’ — it has so much weight in terms of being in solidarity with other Campuses and being able to say UC Santa Barbara will have no confidence with you because of your history,” Campos said. “These concerns are valid.

It’s supposed to be a place that creates student leaders.

Now her track record is making many students question her ability to prioritize the needs of undocumented UC students, and various students groups — such as Human Rights Board, the Black Student Union and UCSB Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success (a coalition of undocumented students) — all formally denounced her appointment at yesterday’s Senate meeting.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eNapolitano was appointed by the UC Regents to replace Mark Yudof as UC President in July, with all but Student Regent Cinthia Flores voting in favor of her appointment.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eAt Public Forum, students and other community members voiced support for a unified resolution called “A Resolution in Support of Undocumented Students and Immigrant Communities,” which presents several demands to recently appointed Napolitano. The Resolution concludes by stating that, if passed, the Senate expresses “no confidence” in Napolitano’s ability to perform as UC President. However, as of press time, Senate decided to not vote on the issue and wait until next week to reach a final decision.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eKatlen Abuata of Human Rights Board was the first to approach the A.S. Senate with her support of the resolution, and Abuata said Napolitano’s appointment jeopardizes the safety of certain minority communities on campus.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e“You all are here and you have the extreme privilege of representing a diverse group of students; some of these students are undocumented,” Abuata said. “Some of these students have a fear of having a leader of their UC system being someone that deported hundreds of thousands of people.”\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eSecond-year Mohsin Mirza, who also came on behalf of HRB, said the process by which Napolitano was selected does not reflect the interests of the general UC student population.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e“I think we need to highlight the fact that her appointment in the first place was completely undemocratic,” Mirza said. “None of [the potential candidates] have any experience with education … As student leaders here, you’re asked to represent the students … I don’t see a group here saying ‘We love Napolitano. We want her to be here.’”\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eGloria Campos of UCSB IDEAS provided a personal testimony of her experience as an undocumented student, explaining why she felt Napolitano was a detrimental influence to the UC system.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e“I am an undocumented student. I was at that meeting yesterday with Napolitano,” Campos said.  “I can’t say how I felt … to have someone that has caused so much damage to our community — not only students who are undocumented, but students who aren’t undocumented who have parents [who] are undocumented … I don’t know if you can understand what that feels like to have her as our new UC president.”\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eLiam Stanton, another student at Public Forum, provided another perspective on the resolution. While Stanton said he disagreed with Napolitano’s appointment, he urged Senators to move forward through open negotiations, rather than a vote of no confidence.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e“The reality of it is that now she is the president of the UC system,” Stanton said. “I don’t believe that an utter show of no confidence gets us anywhere.”\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eFourth-year Norma Orozco also came to Public Forum to stress the negative impact of Napolitano’s appointment on undocumented students at UCSB, saying that UCSB should value their undocumented community.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e“This year, in fact, we have the largest amount of undocumented population at UCSB, and it’s something to be proud of,” Orozco said. “It is our duty, our responsibility, and it is our right to tell her that we have no confidence in her.”\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eChancellor Henry T. Yang also spoke at the meeting, assuring the student body that he would be available for any necessary support. Additionally, Off-Campus Senator Jake Speyer announced he would be transferring schools after Fall Quarter, and therefore resigning from his senatorial position, which means the candidate who received the next most votes during last spring’s elections will be offered the position.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eThe executive officers presented their first reports for the coming school year, announcing what projects would be released from their respective offices. These include renovations to the UCen, a student-led classes initiative, a waitlist system to be implemented on UCSB GOLD and a visit by President Napolitano to the campus in November, at which students will be able to directly address her with concerns.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis article appeared on page 4 of Thursday October 3, 2013′s print edition of \u003c/em\u003eThe Daily Nexus.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: #ff0000;\"\u003e[CORRECTION: The print version of this article was incorrectly titled, “A.S.

She also said she felt party affiliation was not difficult to discern with candidates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I feel like it’s pretty obvious whether or not you’re party affiliated,” Osato said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Senate also decided to approve the appointments and during the meeting, the new executive officers delivered reports on their first weeks in office. Officers announced their decisions regarding their appointments for staff, while also discussing the progress of their respective offices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExternal Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore said he met with leaders of the queer community, who had expressed a desire to reach out to members of Greek life on campus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They want to do some Greek outreach because they feel like there’s some problems coming from the fraternities especially,” Moore said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExternal Vice President of Statewide Affairs Alex Choate said she is focusing on the question of online education in the UC system, for which there are currently two bills in front of the California Senate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The bills are SB 520, which we really don’t like because it basically is going to allow for the privatization of our education, allowing for private entities to come in and profit,” Choate said. “Another one is SB 547, but it doesn’t have nearly as much support in the Senate, as of right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA.S. President Jonathan Abboud discussed the addition of a new position on his staff — the deputy chief of staff — while Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet’s report focused on transitions to the new Senate, discussing projects that must be handed down to new senators, including a Sobering Center in Isla Vista and an LGBTQ General Education requirement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudent Advocate General Kristian Whittaker said he is working on a convention with the SAGs from colleges throughout Southern California, and that he has already begun working on his advocacy agenda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"\u003e\u003ci class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003ePrint\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"sd-title\"\u003eShare this:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"sd-content\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-facebook\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51652\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-twitter\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51652\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-tumblr\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-reddit\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-end\"\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRelated\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e          \u003c/div\u003e","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-31/senators-confirm-new-appointees-listen-to-new-executives/","id":3058,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3057,3056,3055],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bike Safety Week Holds Workshop, Surveys on Campus Bicycle Paths","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The A.S.
