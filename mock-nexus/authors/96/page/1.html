the 14,505-foot peak located in Sequoia National Park. The group had no high-altitude training and no previous experience hiking the summit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe climbers woke up the day of the climb at 2 a.m. to begin the ascent by 3 a.m. They summited the mountain by 11:30 a.m., taking a one-hour break at the crest and then continuing down the mountain to reach the base at approximately 5:30 p.m. By midnight they arrived back in I.V., and many cadets attended class the following day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe excursion was incorporated into the ROTC preparation for the Ranger Challenge competition in Fall Quarter, during which 11 UCSB ROTC cadets compete as a team in a series of military skills events against teams of cadets from other universities around the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eROTC cadets Dominique Chan, third-year global studies major, and Theo Vance, second-year communication major and a team captain who helped organize the climb, both described the ascent to Mt. Whitney’s peak as a mental and physical test that rivaled anything they have experienced in their cadet training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe typical hiker will take two days to make the climb, camping overnight at 10,000 to 12,000 feet to acclimate to the elevation and then summit the mountain the following day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Chan and Vance agreed, however, that the one-day climb made for a more rewarding endeavor, with more notable bragging rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have never done something that gnarly before. I knew it would be hard. I didn’t realize it was going to be that hard,” Vance said. “But it was the comradery of it. ROTC kids are kind of tough by necessity. So just knowing that you’re not the only one being pushed, that you’re all in it together, and you start as a team, and you finish as a team.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_78234\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78234\" data-attachment-id=\"78234\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/rotc-cadets-conquer-mount-whitney-in-under-15-hours/img_4218/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_4218\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?fit=250%2C188\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?fit=888%2C666\u0026amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78234\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218-1024x768.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=1024%2C768\u0026amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=250%2C188\u0026amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=768%2C576\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=1832%2C1374\u0026amp;ssl=1 1832w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=1376%2C1032\u0026amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=1044%2C783\u0026amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=632%2C474\u0026amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=536%2C402\u0026amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?w=2048\u0026amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-78234\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCourtesy of Dominique Chan\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChan said the climb was definitely harder than she had anticipated. Though many cadets had taken Diamox prior to reaching Mt.

Whitney.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVance said the cadets were told this was likely one of the most challenging times in the last 10 years to make the climb because of heavy snowfall this past winter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The trail normally takes you on this marked path that has a railing and all this stuff. That was about 10 feet below us, apparently, from all the snow,” Vance said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe added that the use of ice axes and crampons, traction devices attached to footwear for improved stability, were “absolutely vital” because the path was difficult to navigate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVance said the warm weather made for a beautiful day to climb but also increased the difficulty of the ascent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“[The snow] was very soft, very sludgy, and that’s very dangerous on this portion called the chute, which is kind of the steepest part,” Vance said.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe cadets made the climb up the snow chute, an area directly between the switchbacks and face of the mountain, in approximately an hour and a half with the help of their snow equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s just straight absolute uphill, and you are just ice-axing it the entire way and using your crampons,” Vance said. “Even with that, you’re slipping and sliding sometimes, and you lose your footing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Without the crampons, we could have fallen to our death, basically, or rolled down, tumbled down,” Chan added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVance said being comfortable with the ice equipment became critical on the descent down the snow chute, a 60-degree downhill that measures approximately 1,500 feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The chute, because it was so steep, there’s no way to get back down,” Vance said. “So it took us about an hour and a half, hour and 40 to get up, and for me personally it took about 35 seconds to get down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_78236\" style=\"width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78236\" data-attachment-id=\"78236\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/rotc-cadets-conquer-mount-whitney-in-under-15-hours/img_4248/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?fit=960%2C720\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_4248\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?fit=250%2C188\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?fit=888%2C666\u0026amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78236\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?w=960\u0026amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?resize=250%2C188\u0026amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?resize=768%2C576\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?resize=632%2C474\u0026amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?resize=536%2C402\u0026amp;ssl=1 536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-78236\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCourtesy of Dominique Chan\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cadets trekked through varied terrain throughout the day, with changes in environment coming quickly with little warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you’re coming up, it’s just kind of mountain wilderness,” Vance said. “Then eventually, out of nowhere, it just turns into snowy woods … The higher you get it just becomes more and more just kind of rocks and boulders and just snow. Then, once you get past the chute, it’s just all mountain range. Once you’re up at the steep portion, you go behind this ridgeline, and pretty much there you can see just for miles, just mountain tops.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At that point you’re going single file, so you get to the hardest part, and then single file, you’re hugging the side of a mountain,” Chan added. “That’s like 13,000 feet, so the last part is only a thousand-foot climb, but it’s just, like, two more miles of just making your way up there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVance said while the snow made the journey more challenging, it also added to the beauty of the scenery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can see just mountain ranges on mountain ranges and you can see the lakes and rivers and stuff, but they’re frozen over,” Vance said. “It’s kind of interesting to see the different tints of snow because you can pick out different landmarks, but it’s still just all snow. It’s really beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadets who wanted to make the climb trained throughout Spring Quarter at 5:30 a.m. three days a week for an hour prior to their required ROTC workouts at 6:30 a.m. The group also met Wednesday nights for skills training, for a total of four additional hours of training a week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The team that wanted to come out, we had tryouts, and kind of the incentive for them to work hard this quarter was that at the end we would climb Mt. Whitney,” Vance said. “The training was kind of geared around getting people in shape for Ranger Challenge and teaching them stuff that they would need to know but also to prepare for Whitey as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Chan and Vance said they packed only granola bars and water to sustain themselves through the climb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I had probably a 25-pound pack and half of it was probably water. I didn’t end up drinking all of it, but it was important that some people brought more for the people that brought less because a lot of people ran out along the way,” Vance said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChan said as an inexperienced climber she appreciated all the research the team captains put into preparing for the trip to ensure the entire group’s safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The team captains made sure to really study up and research what was needed ahead of time to really make sure to take care of their people,” Chan said. “Overall, not only was it a really cool adventure, but I think it was a really good leadership training exercise for the people who were in charge of this trip.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVance said although four members of the group had to turn back due to altitude sickness, he was still very happy that the remaining 12 were able to reach the summit with little trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We all came back as a group,” Vance said. “I was very, very impressed with how many people got through it, considering how tough it was and just the conditions … like the sheer brutality of it, because altitude sickness is one of those things you can’t train for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChan said team comradery motivated the cadets to reach to the top, as they relied on each other for support to push their physical and mental boundaries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There were definitely periods of just silence, I think mostly because people were just so tired and so focused that it would take even more energy to even talk,” Chan said. “But I don’t think I could have made it up there without all my friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eA version of this story appeared on

Stoll added this board would allow the police to address community concerns directly in a manner that is open to the public. Dumlao said having more training for the police force in I.V. is a crucial part of how they interact with the community and the current trainings are insufficient. He added that C.A.R.E. training, LGBTQ training, a racial-sensitivity training and a religious safety training are all necessary to prepare them to engage with the diverse population in I.V. Dumlao also said he wants to create more of a culture of community policing because Isla Vistans are capable and willing to care for their community and “don’t need an extreme police force every time there is a huge event in Isla Vista” to keep the community safe.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eFIRST PRIORITIES: \u003c/b\u003eStoll said her first priority upon taking office would be to assist students struggling with tenants’ rights by creating an online platform similar to Rate My Professor but with profiles on landlords.

She said she also aims to establish a community court in I.V. at which students could address minor misdemeanors instead of having to go to downtown Santa Barbara to deal with common tickets like minor in possession and drunk in public. Dumlao said his first priority would be to create sexual assault policies that serve the needs of survivors in I.V. and reverse the trend of incidents going unreported by working with the C.A.R.E. office and CSD to “empower survivors to come out and tell their stories and gain support.”\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eFAMILIES: \u003c/b\u003eStoll said the best thing to do to help the families living in I.V. is to support the CSD and all its efforts to bring them into the community because, as a representative of students, it’s not her position to support their needs directly. She said she would support the CSD board’s aims to create tenant mediation and translation services specifically designed for these families. Dumlao said the first step to helping I.V. families is to reach out to them to learn more about their needs, followed by further action to create a community culture that “revolves around safety and love.” He said he plans to foster this through mentorship programs and increased resources available to all community members, regardless if they are students, such as a food bank and C.A.R.E. offices.\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_77104\" style=\"width: 710px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77104\" data-attachment-id=\"77104\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vice-president-of-local-affairs-debate-dumlao-vs-stoll/dsc_0081-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DSC_0081 (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?fit=888%2C592\u0026amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-77104\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1-1024x683.jpg?resize=700%2C467\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683\u0026amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167\u0026amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?w=2048\u0026amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-77104\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTatiana \u003c/em\u003eKarme\u003cem\u003e-Scalisi / Daily Nexus\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003ePARKING: \u003c/b\u003eDumlao suggested establishing a UCSB shuttle system that would employ student workers and decrease carbon emissions, as well as designating a location outside of I.V. to park cars during Deltopia weekend, free of charge.

He said addressing a hate crime incident immediately will increase transparency, and making resources known to victims is important to demonstrate that “we don’t stand for it and that we are willing to talk about it.”\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eNOISE ORDINANCE:\u003c/b\u003e Dumlao said a 10 p.m. noise ordinance through the weekend would not be a good idea because students need time to relax. He also said that, for many communities that are race-based, loud music and dancing are part of social gatherings. He added that the ordinance could increase tension between students and law enforcement and that there should be an emphasis on increased cooperation between neighbors regarding noise. Stoll said the county’s decision over summer to vote on the 10 p.m. noise ordinance without consulting student opinions is evidence of a “systemic problem” that has existed for decades, in which the county decides on policies for I.V. while students have no voice. She said working with the CSD will ensure that students are consulted by representatives to create continuity on policies that affect I.V. residents.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eCOMMUNITY RESOURCES:\u003c/b\u003e Stoll said she has discussed various projects with the I.V. Tenants Union (IVTU), including a website to profile landlords and also a mobile application that lists students’ rights as tenants. On the app, students could upload a part of their lease to have an open dialogue and learn how to deal with problems with their landlords. “This is the first time they have probably entered into any kind of legal contract as an adult, and it’s really difficult to understand the legalities. There’s a lot of loopholes. I think landlords take advantage of the fact that students don’t really know what they’re doing,” she said. Dumlao argued that many students don’t have the option to access resources like IVTU amid their studies and jobs, so IVTU staff should go door-to-door to reach those people who are “not privileged enough” to access them on their own time.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eUNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AND FAMILIES: \u003c/b\u003eDumlao said being able to reach out to people who are undocumented to communicate to them their rights, with translation services available, is key because many members of the undocumented community don’t have the time to access the resources available to them. “They’re really just surviving on a day-to-day basis. Our job is to make sure they can thrive wherever they are living,” he said. Stoll said she would support efforts to create a sanctuary county in Santa Barbara because members of the undocumented community should be allowed to live their lives.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003ePOLICE BRUTALITY: \u003c/b\u003eStoll said the best means of addressing police brutality is to break down barriers between the community and law enforcement. She re-emphasized the importance of creating a police collaborative board. “We need to hold them accountable as people part of our community, but we owe them the benefit of the doubt as well … they are here to keep us safe at the end of the day,” she said. Dumlao again said one way to combat police mistreatment is to hold additional trainings for police officers. “The police do get paid to do their job, and we need to make sure we are giving them the resources to do their job as efficiently as they possibly can,” he said.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn each of their closing remarks, both candidates emphasized their dedication to working alongside the CSD board to create a strong and safe community in I.V.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStoll said she plans to address each of the issues in the I.V. community one-by-one in the most thorough way possible and will draw on her experience as an off-campus senator and a member of the CSD campaign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Knowing our representatives [and] being a part of these community meetings, I feel that I will be the best person to represent student voices in our local government and in our county and make sure Isla Vista stays strong and stays safe and students are aware of their resources and representation,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDumlao emphasized that it is extremely important to him to ensure that all I.V. residents are welcomed and safe in I.V. by making sure that the the CSD hears marginalized students’ voices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are many communities in Isla Vista that don’t feel welcome and don’t feel safe all the time,” Dumlao said. “We want to make sure that Isla Vista is a place that we all feel loved.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCampaigning for A.S.

Observers correlate this decrease with the election of Donald Trump as U.S. President.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong more than 250 colleges and universities across the country, more than 40 percent reported at least a 2 percent decrease in international applicants, according to findings released April 5 by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe UC saw a similar trend in 2004 and 2005 following the U.S.-led multinational invasion of Iraq. In contrast, American students responded to heightened political tensions following President George W. Bush’s declaration of a “war on terror” by showing an increased interest in studying abroad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Juan Campo, the UCSB Education Abroad Program director, this year’s increase in applicants to EAP programs around the world is related to controversy surrounding the new administration’s policies, mirroring the surge in applicants in the aftermath of 9/11.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there are currently no EAP programs in the six countries under Trump’s Middle East travel ban, Jordan is a popular location for students interested in studying in the region because of its central location and reputation as a reasonably stable nation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Campo, more UCSB students applied to the EAP programs in Jordan than ever before, with an increase from three applicants for the 2016-17 school year to 13 for the 2017-18 school year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our enrollments are up over last year, and I am not surprised,” Campo said. “[After 9/11] people were saying, ‘Oh, it’s going to go down,’ but no, because it may cause students to want to become more engaged with the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what’s happening now … It’s really heartening to see that and looking system-wide they have a higher number of applications at this time than they had last year at this time,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe UC Office of the President has not yet determined if the drop in applicants of 1.2 percent at Berkeley and 2.2 percent at Riverside is linked to the national phenomenon, as official enrollment figures will be released later in April.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa Przekop, UCSB director of admissions, said it is difficult to determine whether the university’s international applicant numbers will be similarly affected in the coming years. She acknowledged that the current political climate in the U.S. is a legitimate concern for students abroad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s important that we continue to communicate honestly with prospective students so we can address their concerns honestly, dispel inaccurate rumors, and show them that UCSB is a friendly community with esteemed faculty and talented students,” she said in an email.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrzekop said the close proximity of the application deadline to the presidential election likely influenced students’ decision whether or not to apply to the UC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There was election coverage that didn’t always show the U.S. as being welcoming to international guests,” Przekop said in an email. “Students abroad pay very close attention to what is happening politically in the U.S. and I’m certain that this played at least a small role in UC application numbers from international students.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMahdi Golkaram, an Iranian mechanical engineering Ph.D. student at UCSB, said his peers in Iran have certainly been discouraged from studying in the U.S. since the implementation of the travel ban.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Golkaram, the increasingly challenging process of obtaining a student visa, not the political tensions arising in the early months of the Trump administration, is the major deterrent for students debating whether to study in the U.S.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At the end of the day if they need to get the admission letter, clearance, background check, it takes a long time. I have a lot of friends they just gave up and they went to Canada,” Golkaram said.\u003cbr\u003e\n“Right now, I have been talking to a lot of friends, and they don’t even think about applying to the United States anymore because they know how hard it will be for them to go through this whole process,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGolkaram added that single-entry visas typically administered to international students make travel outside the U.S. nearly impossible, and he hasn’t left the U.S. for three years because he fears he may not secure a visa again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would rather not leave the United States at all, which means I’m not going to see my country again for a long time,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Golkaram, the inability to travel outside of the U.S. proves especially challenging for graduate students, who are often expected to attend conferences abroad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimran Singh, director of the Office of International Student Services, said while the current political climate is likely a concern for international students, as well as for their parents, the more common barrier is posed by the complications in obtaining a visa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the recent five percent increase in UC tuition for non-California residents brought the total cost to $41,964, Singh said she believes the tuition hike is not a likely contributing factor to the decrease in international applicants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you look at the socioeconomic background of the students who are coming here, they really come from wealthy families and I don’t think that’s a deterrent per se,” Singh said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile UCSB has yet to see a decrease in international applicants, Singh said, it is important for all departments on campus to make them feel safe and promote a reputation that the UC is equipped with the proper infrastructure to support traveling scholars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are talked about as a world class research institution and what they really bring is the diversity,” Singh said. “These students bring so much of themselves when they come into our countries and into our institutions. We learn from them as much as they learn from us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCampo said the nationwide decrease in international applicants is very understandable “given the chaos” surrounding the implementation of the travel ban and the university should be taking concrete steps to ensure international students are not “affected adversely” by policies emerging from the Trump White House.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The university has to affirm its place, not as a safe zone so much, but as a forum for bringing these issues to the surface and taking a clear stand on how a civil society remains open and tolerant to different points and perspectives to prevent people from being victims of racial violence or xenophobic or religious bias,” Campo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eA version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the\u003c/em\u003e Daily Nexus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv

I have a problem with my government and a problem with my family, but mentally it’s draining and it’s tough to deal with, but I think I can deal with it by myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Jammeh did eventually visit the Counseling \u0026amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) center, he said he felt the experience was “a waste of time,” because the staff member he spoke with didn’t understand his culture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Counseling has to hire people that understand about international students because, my first person that I was talking to had no clue about anything that I was talking about,” Jammeh said. “I don’t blame them for not knowing my culture, but the university has to spend to teach these people about diversity so international students will feel safe to go and talk to them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarmer said the faculty and staff should know the protocol for how best to help a distressed student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“[We need] to constantly inform students that there’s a place to turn because there’s a lot of mental health issues these days and we need to recognize them and get people to the help they need,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJammeh said it is incredibly important for students to watch for warning signs that their peers are in distress and talk to them about what they are going through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you see someone is not acting right, you just have to make an effort to talk to them,” Jammeh said. “‘Hey, what’s going on? Is everything ok?’ Those things, people see these as a small things, but they really help. When my friend called me and talked to me, that stopped everything. It’s like I was reborn again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_71449\" style=\"width: 370px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71449\" data-attachment-id=\"71449\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/gambian-ucsb-student-granted-political-asylum-in-the-united-states/alagie-jammeh-by-jenny-luo-online-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Alagie Jammeh 5/26\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=167%2C250\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=682%2C1024\u0026amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-71449\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4-682x1024.jpg?resize=360%2C540\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"360\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=682%2C1024\u0026amp;ssl=1 682w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=167%2C250\u0026amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=768%2C1152\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Alagie-Jammeh-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-4.jpg?w=1333\u0026amp;ssl=1 1333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-71449\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eJenny Luo / Daily Nexus\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eA NEW HOME\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first of his siblings to graduate high school, Jammeh will again break new ground in his family on June 12, becoming the first to obtain a college degree when he graduates with a Bachelor of Arts in global studies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJammeh said the commencement date has “crept up” on him.

I will have a voice,” Jammeh said. “My hope is to become a human rights advocate all over the world, not just for gay rights but human rights in general: women’s rights, children’s rights and other rights.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob, senior associate dean for student affairs, said Jammeh could be an influential activist for gender equality in West Africa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He can play a role as a man from that part of the world to advocate on behalf of women as any ally in forms and ways that women might not be listened to but he, as a man, could,” Jacob said. “If there were a change in government [in Gambia] maybe it would be safe enough for him to return home to work there. If not there, then maybe in neighboring countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitman, director of LGBT services, described Jammeh as endlessly insightful, loving and gracious — an “old soul” who he will look up to for the rest of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitman said he hopes Jammeh’s story will remind people of their own potential for giving back and reaffirm their gratitude for comfort and safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He had the ability to think freely despite a socialization that would tell him otherwise … he had the power in his sense of self to break out of that,” Whitman said. “How are you giving your heart and mind to someone or something that isn’t about you? He does not identify with the community. It’s not about him. He could have easily just stayed quiet and I don’t see that a lot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJammeh admitted that it would have been easier to remain in Gambia, where he would likely be married like many of his brothers and sisters, rather than pursuing an education in America. He attributed the decision to leave his old life behind to his desire to have control over his future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you’re really good at what you do, people will find it very difficult to deny you of what you want,” Jammeh said. “If you’re good at what you do, they will run out of excuses to say no. You have to decide your future for yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJammeh said he aims to be one of the most educated people in Africa, especially in Gambia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e“There hasn’t been a UCSB student in collective memory that has gone through what he’s gone through, and so it’s a huge moment to honor allyship.” — Dave Whitman\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want children who grow up in the Gambia to think that they could become someone,” he said. “The Gambia is not going to be developed by some western or some European or some Chinese country. The Gambia is only going to be developed by the Gambian people, especially people who went to school in America or in the west to go back to Gambia and contribute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Jammeh, it will take more than a change in government in Gambia for him to be able to return home. The Gambian people hold a common belief that homosexuaity is a sin and a crime against humanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Someone has to be advocating and talking to these communities and tell them, ‘Hey, I have a gay friend and he is normal, he thinks like you. He is smart. He is compassionate. He is loving,’” Jammeh said. “I’m really, really an optimistic person. Ten years ago, if you tell someone gay marriage is going to be legal in all 50 states in the United States, they would be like ‘What are you talking about?’ But it happened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough Jammeh admits that his hopes may not be fulfilled in his lifetime, he has faith that one day the people of Gambia will treat all individuals with respect, regardless of their sexual orientation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m hoping … I will wake up one day and see in the news that being gay is okay all over the world, being gay is okay in Gambia and gay people could go to work, without being discriminated against, go to church or go to mosque and pray without being discriminated against, do anything they want to do without being discriminated against. That would make me very, very happy,” Jammeh said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInspired in his childhood by activists like Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr., Jammeh says he has only begun his journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a dream and that dream is not accomplished.

There are currently only 11 students enrolled in the course, with a remaining 29 spots available for any Star Wars fans looking to deepen their understanding of the galactic saga.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFilm and media studies lecturer Cynthia Felando is offering the course during Summer Session A on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12 p.m. to 2:50 p.m. in Pollock Theater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it’s been nearly 40 years since the original “Star Wars” was released, Felando said the movies continue to shape the film industry. During the course, she will examine George Lucas’s creative process in development of the Star Wars films as well as the blockbuster’s success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“By looking at all of the entries in the franchise, it enables us to consider not only the emergence but also the development of the blockbuster,” Felando said in an email. “And it enables careful attention to the development of George Lucas as an ‘auteur’… and to the ways in which he brought his love and knowledge of movie history, the sci-fi genre, and other popular culture forms to bear on the first and subsequent films.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelando said she loves Star Wars because of the scope of the film’s stories and the depth of their characterizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve taught the original Star Wars as part of a class that considers filmmaking in the 1970s, and it just wasn’t enough Star Wars for me!” Felando said in an email. “It’s a fascinating subject because the \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e films tell a truly epic tale on an epic scale, not only about Luke and his cohorts and enemies, but also about film history and the blockbuster.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngelo Molina, a UCSB alumnus and former co-president of Jedi Gauchos, said the course would satisfy both fans and nonfans alike, giving them the opportunity to learn about a franchise that has returned to popularity after the December release of “The Force Awakens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have actually read a few books on how the franchise began. George Lucas made his life around film,” Molina said. “One person started from almost nothing and built it into what it is now: one of the most recognized franchises in the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe Palladino, the film and media studies academic advisor, sees the Star Wars films as a reflection of business, art and several other aspects of modern culture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You would see the films in Pollock Theater, so it’s going to look and sound just great,” Palladino said. “We just did ‘The Force Awakens’ in December on Sunday with the editor and it looked really nice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan Deffenbaugh, first-year communication and media studies major and self-proclaimed Star Wars fan, said the films were a family tradition while she was growing up and she now gets to experience a digitally “revitalized” version of the series.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s kind of been passed down, therefore I loved it as a kid.

Gun Violence; and Bob Weiss, father of UCSB student Veronica Weiss who was killed in the Isla Vista mass murder in May 2014.

If it were they that lost a sibling or a parent, what that would mean to them,” Jackson said. “In the world we live in today with the proliferation of firearms, if we don’t teach children and others what the consequences are of having those firearms, of considering or using them, we will continue to see 30,000 people a year killed by gun violence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliams said the NRA does not have more resources than those working for limitations on firearms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Their hardcore numbers are actually pretty small, but they mobilize on the issue, they vote on the issue, they give pro-gun politicians money, they make phone calls,” Williams said. “The majority of people are with us on these issues, but there have been no consequences on it, because those who are on our side on this do not mobilize on the issue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreenwald said his hope for the film is that, over time, people will understand gun violence as a public health crisis driven by profit and greed and that they will take action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“[The film] is not about the second amendment; you may have noticed we never mentioned it in the film,” Greenwald said. “Give people a different way to talk about something, and from that it becomes action, and from that it becomes change, and from that we have great elected officials that carry the call and make it happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We are the only country in the world really who has this kind of senseless kind of gun violence; you don’t see this in other countries.” – Helene Schneider\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliams said it was difficult, as a parent, to watch the individuals in the film speak about the loss of their children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To have them be willing to retraumatize themselves in the interest of having other people fall victim to guns … I think we should give Bob, and I think all the parents in the film, some thanks, because it takes a lot of courage and love to do that,” Williams said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Weiss is driven by a desire to prevent others from losing their loved ones, like many other people affected by gun violence, his main motivation is to honor his daughter’s life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She gave her life up for this movement.

dean of the College of Letters and Science, will become the sixth president of Pitzer College this summer and the first African American to ever be appointed president of one of the five undergraduate colleges of the Claremont University Consortium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver has served more than thirty years in the University of California, first as a professor of sociology at UCLA and then as the dean of social sciences at UCSB beginning in 2008. Throughout his career, Oliver strove to create opportunities for minorities in UC, co-founding the UCLA Center for Study of Urban Poverty, and overseeing the creation of Chican@ studies, feminist studies and global studies Ph.D. programs during his tenure at UCSB. Before coming to UCSB, Oliver served as Vice-President of the Asset Building and Community Development Program at the Ford Foundation, where he developed a grant program to provide 35,000 low-wealth households with secure home mortgages and to change the way banks assess home mortgage applicants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver has received multiple distinguished awards and fellowships in recognition of his work in higher education and philanthropy, including the Rockefeller Foundation Research Fellowship, National Science Foundation Research Initiation Planning Grant and more than $5 million in research support from NSF, Ford, Rockefeller, Russell Sage, Haynes, and the Social Science Research Council. During his time at UCLA, he was named the California Professor of the Year for his “extraordinary dedication to teaching and commitment to students.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving earned his bachelor of arts at William Penn College in 1972, Oliver said he is both elated and honored to have been named president of an institution like Pitzer, which has “all of the characteristics of a great liberal arts college” that he admires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve always wanted to go back to my roots,” Oliver said. “The liberal arts was a transformative experience for me … it was the kind of place that encouraged my creativity, it was the kind of place that nurtured my intellectual curiosity and it gave me leadership opportunities to grow and develop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver said his appointment as the first African American president of an undergraduate Claremont college motivates him to create “ladders of opportunity” for those who come from backgrounds similar to his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In a lot of things I’ve done I’ve been the first. The first only means that you have to create the ladders of opportunity for other to follow. It’s not about you, it’s about what you can do for others,” Oliver said. “I see it as one of my responsibilities to create those ladders of opportunity so other students of color, other professors of color, other really disadvantaged folks can also have the same opportunities I’ve had.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver said he was attracted to Pitzer because it reflects his own values, such as commitment to diversity, environmental sustainability and education geared toward social impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Those are all values that I’ve promoted in my life, into my work, and I think Pitzer is the kind of place I can go to and help them double down on some of those concerns they have — some of those issues that they’re grappling with,” Oliver said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChancellor Henry T. Yang said Pitzer is fortunate to have Oliver, as he is a “seasoned administrator” who possesses unique leadership skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His vision and leadership have shaped the academic profile of social sciences at UC Santa Barbara, and he has been exemplary in advancing our commitment to diversity among students, faculty, and staff,” Yang said in an email. “Dean Oliver’s upcoming departure is a bittersweet moment for our university. We are immensely proud of his success, yet we regret losing a dear colleague and friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonald Gould, a Pitzer trustee and head of the presidential search committee, said it took nearly a year to systematically narrow down the approximately 300 applicants, before the Pitzer board of trustees selected from among the final candidates. The board valued Oliver’s administrative and teaching background, as well as his time outside of the academic world, according to Gould.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The board has to select the individual that they feel in all respects, including temperament, experience, judgment, is the best person for the job, and I think that all of those things together led to our putting Melvin Oliver at the top of our list,” Gould said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGould said the board took note of Oliver’s “heart for undergraduate education” and the impact of his own liberal arts educational experience as transformative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even within the large university settings at UCLA and UCSB he’s always been a champion of liberal arts education,” Gould said. “So certainly it will be a different environment than the large University of California environment, but we think that the things he’s learned in the UC system can only be beneficial to us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a broader stage, Oliver said he aims to promote the liberal arts educational environment as one that prepares students for the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We sometimes push for our students to be concerned with that first job out of college. We bemoan that the liberal arts isn’t allowing people to have those $100,000 a year jobs,” Oliver said. “But what we do create in the liberal arts are people who can be engaged citizens … We’re not about the first job, we’re about the last job. We’re about what you’re going to grow into.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver said while he is leaving the UC system, he is hopeful both the California legislature and Governor Jerry Brown will continue to recognize the importance of investing in the UC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The University of California, even with its problems, is still the most important mobility ladder for the state of California,” Oliver said. “The UC will continue to be the leader in doing that and I just hope that they can see the value in investing in UC. When we invest in UC, we invest in the future.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Thursday, February 4, 2016 edition of the \u003cem\u003eDaily

Supervisors allocated $128,000 in contingency funds last week for additional shelter services for the approximately 1,400 homeless individuals seeking refuge from El Niño rain storms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProposed by County Supervisors Doreen Farr and Steve Lavagnino, the two-fold project allocates $91,000 for two daytime shelter locations and provides $37,000 for night warming centers to be available an additional 15 nights. The five warming centers, including the Isla Vista location at the University Methodist Church, have already been activated 27 out of the planned 50 nights across the county, compared to 13 nights this time last year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarr said addressing the needs of the homeless residents could not be put off due to predictions of increasingly poor weather over the next several months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“People need to be cared for sooner, rather than later, so that they don’t get sick. In some cases with the homeless, they will die on the street if they’re not cared for,” Farr said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Jon-Stephen Hedges, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office volunteer chaplain, also said the homeless are at risk in the winter weather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We may not have snow and frostbite here, but it gets pretty close to it, and sooner or later that takes a toll,” Hedges said. “That’s why so many of the folks … died way before, some of them in their late 20s.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warming centers, active Nov. 15 through Mar. 31, provide shelter from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. on nights when the overnight temperature drops below 35 degrees, there is a 50 percent chance of rain predicted for two consecutive nights or a 50 percent chance of temperatures less than 40 degrees for two consecutive nights. According to Farr, the day shelter program was developed to provide a companion piece to the warming centers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That system has worked very well, but there was a concern that that wasn’t enough, that we needed something during the day,” Farr said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day shelters will likely be located at Earl Warren Showgrounds and at Santa Maria’s Minami Center in North County. While these locations are less easily accessible than the five warming centers across the county, Farr said a form of transportation may be provided to shuttle homeless residents to the day centers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We did work with some transit providers, like Easy Lift, to say if we’re able to get these day shelters up and running. If people need assistance in getting there … the people at the warming shelter at night when they’re released at 6 in the morning, we could provide a shuttle service from the warming center locations to the closest day center,” Farr said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJunior Anguiano, Community Affairs Board hunger/houseless co-coordinator and second-year film and media studies and psychology double major, said it is important to provide transportation for the homeless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A lot of them have everything they own on a bike, and you can’t just throw that on a bus and go downtown and have to make that trek,” Anguiano said. “There is no established shelter in I.V. other than the warming center.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHedges said while Reverend Frank Schaefer has been very gracious to open up the University Methodist church as a warming center, the issue of shelter for the homeless individuals in I.V. is about more than just “ducking in to get a dry place to sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The solution really is finding a place, helping us find a place, agitating with us to find a place,” Hedges said. “Also, volunteering with things like Doctors Without Walls, student health outreach, SWIPES.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHedges said he also encourages students, when they feel safe, to reach out to homeless individuals in I.V. in small ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If nothing else, maybe buying somebody a cup of coffee, giving them a justification for being in the Starbucks,” Hedges said. “You know, you see some guy there cold and wet, buy him a cup of coffee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHedges also said he wants UC Santa Barbara to “step up as a neighbor” in finding a long-term solution for housing those living on the streets in I.V.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Long range, the University is building all kinds of stuff here … In all of that development I hope there is some provision for the poor among us,” Hedges said. “Some of the [homeless] folks that have died on the street here started out as students at UCSB … I’m not looking for anyone to come riding in with a bag full of money, but at least let’s be part of the plan together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnguiano also said the homeless community of I.V. is very different than that of cities like Los Angeles or San Francisco and students should take the time to hear their stories and share their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A lot of them come here because they want to hear what college students have to say or the things we’re thinking about,” Anguiano said. “Just talking with them … one-on-one getting to know them, like you’d get to know anyone. Just because they’re houseless doesn’t take away their humanity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eA version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Jan. 28, 2016 edition of the \u003c/em\u003eDaily Nexus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"\u003e\u003ci class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003ePrint\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"sd-title\"\u003eShare this:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"sd-content\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-facebook\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67741\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-twitter\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67741\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-tumblr\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-reddit\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-end\"\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRelated\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e          \u003c/div\u003e","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/county-funds-homeless-shelters/","id":3870,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[3869,3868,3867],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nexus Update: I.V.

organizations, including Fossil Free UCSB, gathered outside Cheadle Hall Thursday afternoon to protest for the UC Board of Regents to divest from the fossil fuel industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProtesters marched from Cheadle Hall through the Arbor to the patio behind the MultiCultural Center (MCC) carrying a plastic model of a pipeline and chanting, “We are unstoppable. Another world is possible.” The protest continued with presentations from event organizers demanding the UC divest from companies involved in oil spills and invest in students, followed by public comment from faculty, alumni and students on their frustration over the May 19 Refugio oil spill of over 100,000 gallons and the environmental damage caused by the fossil fuel industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMember of the California Students Sustainability Coalition and the Students Against Fracking campaign and UCSB alumnus Arlo Bender-Simon said he is frustrated the money he paid to the UC during his four years at UCSB is invested in the fossil fuel industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The money that I have put into the UC system over the last four years is being invested into fossil fuel companies that continue to profit off of disastrous spills,” Bender-Simon said. “We really need to let our regents, our campus administration know it’s not ok for them to keep investing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFossil Fuel Divestment Campaign Director for California Students Sustainability Coalition and UCSB alumna Emily Williams said the Refugio oil spill is not an isolated incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a symptom; it’s just one piece of a much larger pattern that we see with the fossil-fuel-powered economy,” Williams said. “The root cause is this industry and, as it turns out, our university invests a lot of money in ExxonMobil, whose oil is being carried in Peabody [Energy] coal and a lot of these huge culprits. So we’re demanding that the university stop investing in these fuels and start investing in students, and start investing in our futures.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe UCSB Academic Senate voted in favor of fossil fuel divestment in 2013 and Fossil Free UCSB is now working to gain Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s support of the movement, according to Williams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On campus, we are really focusing on getting Chancellor Yang to come out and support his students and faculty, because all these different bodies have already come out in support of it,” Williams said. “We know we have the finances behind us, we know we have the morals behind us, let’s go back into negotiations and get this thing to happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudents Against Fracking Chair, Fossil Free UC and Environmental Affairs Board member and fourth-year global studies major Kiyomi De Zoysa said she views the recent spill as an opportunity for the community to change its opinion about investing in the fossil fuel industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Especially at the UC, we’re complacent; we’re supporting Exxon, and Exxon’s product is what directly spilled into our environment,” De Zoysa said. “So we are directly invested in Exxon’s work. So, by that, we need to not be involved in it and make a political statement, social statement. It’s a moral imperative as the world’s greatest public institution.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBender-Simon said Students Against Fracking aims to use the oil spill to mobilize students to participate in the movement to divest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re trying to figure out how we can really educate people about what fracking is, what steam injection is, what acidizing is, why we really don’t need to be doing all these newer, dirtier, more energy-intensive extraction techniques and why we need to move towards renewable energy,” Bender-Simon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliams said she believes discussions on whether the Paddle Out on Wednesday as part of the May 23 memorial events series should have been canceled because of the recent spill signify the importance of divesting from the fossil fuel industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Paddle Out that was earlier [last] week, I think the fact that that beautiful ceremony was threatened by this oil spill also made people really realize, when we’re trying to come together as a community, there is this industry that’s blocking our way,” Williams said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDe Zoysa said she was pleased with the turnout at the protest and hopes to see students continue to get involved in the campaign to divest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was surprised at how many people came out. Not just students, but a lot of influential activists on campus: John Foran and others,” De Zoysa said. “I was really happy and inspired to see people come up and speak their hearts and share information and how we can all get involved. I feel this momentum is building.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDe Zoysa said she has seen an increase in the amount of student participation in environmental organizations on campus since the Refugio oil spill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This event would not have had such a turnout if it weren’t for the oil spill,” De Zoisa said. “This is a great opportunity to reel as many people in as possible because they understand … animals are dying and washing up on shore and it’s really sad and it’s our fault. So we have a responsibility to make it right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst-year sociology major Pierce Abrahamson said he believes UCSB cannot claim to be one of the country’s top environmentally conscious universities when they are part of a system investing in the fossil fuel industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We as a school can say, ‘Oh, we’re environmental, we’re the greenest campus in the United States,’ but it doesn’t really mean much if we keep supporting the industry that is undermining the whole entire environmental movement to begin with,” Abrahamson said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliams said any student who values the beach and ocean should think about participating with one of the many environmental groups on campus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This isn’t a campaign for financial experts. This isn’t a campaign for crazy radicals. This is a campaign for anyone who wants to have a livable future,” Williams said. “This is for anyone who thinks our beaches and oceans shouldn’t be filled with oil. So people should get involved … you don’t have to be an ‘activist’ to do it. This is not radical. This is very much something that is affecting us, and we need to make a change.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button

together on Friday to discuss demands made by students during the May 13 sit-in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe “It’s Not On Us, It’s On You” campaign led by survivors of sexual assault Alejandra Melgoza, Lexi Weyrick and Melissa Vasquez will host an open forum discussion between students and university administrators on Friday in the State Street room of the University Center at 10 a.m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelgoza, Weyrick and Vasquez led a 13-hour sit-in at Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s office on May 13 to demand specific policies to improve the university’s handling of sexual assault cases. One of the stipulations made in the discussion that concluded the sit-in was an agreement to hold a public forum which Yang would attend. Interim Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Mary Jacob, Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming and additional administrators, including members of the Office of Judicial Affairs, have also committed to participate in the forum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forum will include clarification of the demands and further discussion of plans to meet the students’ requests. On the event Facebook page, organizers cautioned those who plan to attend that administrators are mandatory reporters, meaning students should not share details of their experiences of sexual violence or sexual assault if they do not wish to “inadvertently begin an investigation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaucho Consent Co-Chair, Take Back the Night Executive Board member and second-year sociology major Lexi Weyrick said the forum will provide students an opportunity to voice their concerns to administrators on issues related to sexual violence and sexual assault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a good setup for students to be able to air their grievances, for administration to see that this isn’t just about the three of us, to make sure that people are aware of the implications of sexual assault and sexual violence on the campus as a whole,” Weyrick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major Alejandra Melgoza said the event aims to provide students the opportunity to present their concerns on sexual violence and sexual assault to Yang in person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is an open forum for students to voice their concerns to Chancellor Yang and also to voice their concerns about our demands and help brainstorm ideas on how to further improve them or actually get them to happen,” Melgoza said. “It is just really a meeting for students to come talk to the Chancellor about their concerns — since it is pretty hard to get a meeting with him, we figured this would be a good way to have students talk to him face to face.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFleming said while Yang is often limited in the amount of time he can speak with students in person about their concerns, other members-of the administration frequently work one-on-one with students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Chancellor has a pretty full calendar, and so it is challenging sometimes for students,” Fleming said. “Certainly, a lot of us at Students Affairs spend a lot of time working with students directly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFleming also said administrators have discussed plans to increase the amount of communication between students and administrators with It’s Not On Us, It’s On You leaders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What we probably need is some more regular opportunities to hear from students,” Fleming said. “We’ve talked about establishing more of a permanent group that students can be part of that would meet just on a regular basis, maybe quarterly, with those of us that work in these areas to share.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst-year global studies major Catt Phan said she spent six hours at the sit-in and plans to attend the forum because she believes it is “crucial” for students to hold the university accountable for the ways they have handled sexual assault in past years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It seems like admin and judicial affairs care more about our student fees instead of our sanity and bodies,” Phan said in an email. “It’s up to us to have productive dialogue because if change doesn’t happen now, it’s not going to happen later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhan said she believes sexual violence may be the biggest issue on campus and in Isla Vista and the university needs to better educate students on the importance of consent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With the reputation of a ‘party school,’ there is a higher risk of sexual assault and unfortunately not enough people are educated about the sexual violence issues,” Phan said in an email. “We need to educate people and de-stigmatize sexual assault … the idea of consent needs to be further emphasized and survivors need to feel safe enough to come forth with their stories.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssociated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs office fellow and first year psychology major Alissa Gomez said she hopes to see a large number of students at the event because she believes sexual violence and sexual assault are issues affecting students both on campus and on a national level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m hoping that people will feel free to voice their opinions as needed and that they’ll get to say what they feel is needed to their administrators,” Gomez said. “We have the ability as college students to make this change not only on our campus, but on campuses across the nation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeyrick said while she is uncertain how many students will turn out to participate in the discussion, the campaign as a whole has received positive feedback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve had a lot of interest. I feel like there will be a good amount of people, even if it’s just even to like critique our demands I feel like there will be turnout,” Weyrick said. “Also, to address Chancellor Yang, having that opportunity, I think, will get turnout.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast Thursday, Melgoza, Vasquez and Weyrick planned to speak in public forum at the UC Board of Regents meeting to present their demands to UC President Janet Napolitano and Governor Jerry Brown, but were unable to attend due to flight cancelations and delays, according to Weyrick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We got to the airport in plenty of time to catch our flight, but it was overbooked and so they wouldn’t let us on the plane even though we had reserved seats,” Weyrick said. “So that started just a snowball effect — we couldn’t get on the standby for the second, our third flight got cancelled, the fourth flight was delayed an hour.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeyrick said although she, Melgoza and Vasquez were unable to attend the meeting, they still plan to make their demands known at a system-wide level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were unable to attend the Regents meeting, but we do still have a meeting with [UC Senior Vice President and Chief Compliance and Audit Officer] Sheryl Vacca in the works, so we’re still meeting with her, regardless,” Weyrick said. “We have a guarantee of a meeting, we are just scheduling it now.
