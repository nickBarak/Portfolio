After a game that was mostly dominated by a Gaucho offense, the Highlander defense proved too stingy to allow any more than several shots on goal.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, no Gaucho attempts hit the back of the net and all Riverside needed was one in order to shock their opponents; and that they did as their window of opportunity presented itself in the 87<sup>th</sup> minute of play.</p>\n<p>Thus, the men’s soccer season has now come to a conclusion. Besides a foul ridden game and countless rotational substitutions, not much went for either team throughout the entire match.</p>\n<p>The first save of the night came fairly early as Gaucho freshman forward Sahid Conteh landed a sweeping shot that was covered by Highlander goalkeeper Vincent Morales. UCSB’s following shot was even closer than the previous as a well placed header by midfielder Joseph Ammer collided with the post in the 13<sup>th</sup> minute. For the rest of the first half the Gauchos dominated the majority of possession, but without another key opportunity it remained quiet and scoreless.</p>\n<p>Following the second whistle signaling the second half start, a combined 19 substitutions were made during play as both head coaches sought after any switch that may tip the balance of the game in their favor. Soon after, it was Sanchez’ score that sent UCSB’s ‘Soccer Heaven’ into a state of shock as the Gauchos fell victim to an early round exit.</p>\n<p>Harder Stadium was gloomy as the game-winning goal took the breath out of everyone and the final whistle sounded. Exhausted Gaucho players fell on top of the pitch as the Highlanders celebrated their biggest upset of the year.</p>\n<p>The severity of the loss was evident as Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg spoke to his team on the field rather than in the locker room.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had a trying and challenging season with lots of issues, going all the way back to Kevin [Feucht] getting hurt … so we’ve been playing catch up all year,” he said. “We went the first six games scoring three goals, the first three games scoring no goals, and ironically we ended the season just how we started it.”</p>\n<p>The coach’s words rang true as the Gauchos lack of offense decided not only the result of the postseason match, but several others throughout the year. Regardless of controlling the rhythm of games and minimizing opponents’ time of possession, the Gauchos just seemed to be missing that playmaking ability in the final third of their season.</p>\n<p>“Tonight, we were getting close but frankly I got nothing from my bench tonight. No one came off the bench tonight and helped us, and that was my biggest disappointment,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ head coach would then go on and mention the importance of finding some bench production within their current 27-man roster. Altogether, hopes still remain high for this young and very talented UCSB roster.</p>\n<p>Perhaps in the offseason, the team will work on adding the playmakers required in order to add to their future season’s total goal tally. For now, the Gauchos must put this loss behind them and focus on developing their star underclassmen as they shape the future of the UCSB men’s soccer program.</p><div

as it takes on national powerhouse Stanford at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>“We feel confident. We’ve had a good training camp, we’ve had good practices, we had some things go well in the Westmont game,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “I don’t think you’re ever quite ready to play Stanford in your first game no matter what your preparation is, but our schedule is built to play some of the top teams in the country and at some point, whether its first game or fifth game, we’re going to play teams like Stanford.”</p>\n<p>Last Saturday, Santa Barbara got its 2015 campaign off on the right foot as it took down Westmont 4-1 in the two teams’ annual preseason tune-up match. With five new starters in the lineup since the end of last season, the short amount of time that the Gauchos had in their first action together should be invaluable as they look to build chemistry prior to today’s game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Offensively we kind of got what we were looking for,” Vom Steeg said. “I think the area of importance for us is defensively. I thought that we needed to do better just in transition to our defense. Defensively I think we have quite a few things we have to do in order to get ready to play Stanford.”</p>\n<p>Stanford comes to town with high expectations for the year, boasting a No. 8 national ranking based on the NSCAA Coaches poll earlier this month. The Cardinal finished last season with a record of 13-3-3 overall and 6-1-3 in the conference, winning its first Pac-12 Title in 13 years in the process.</p>\n<p>One week after becoming conference champions, Stanford’s streak of nine unbeaten games was ended by a 1-0 loss in its first NCAA Tournament game to UC Irvine, the same team that knocked UCSB out of the Big West Tournament Semifinals. The Cardinal went 1-0-1 in its two preseason games this season, winning 2-0 against CSU Bakersfield before drawing 0-0 against Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos last faced Stanford on the road in September of last year. A much more inexperienced team at the time, Santa Barbara fell behind early, giving up three goals within the first 12 minutes.</p>\n<p>“Stanford is particularly a good team this year but in general, they’re just a hard team to play against,” Vom Steeg said. “I do like us going into this game a lot better than we did last year. Last year we started five freshmen, so we’re a more experienced team. The players that were on the field last year when we played at Stanford, I wouldn’t say they want revenge, but you want to play that game again after what happened to us last year.”</p>\n<p>Nick DePuy will be the focal point of UCSB’s offense once again. The junior forward led the team with ten goals last season and got off to a good start with two goals against Westmont.</p>\n<p>“We know that [sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani] and Nick are going to be two really important players for us,” Vom Steeg said. “We have a number of players who have played two full seasons, but at the same time we had five new starters against Westmont, so that’s half your team.”</p>\n<p>For a team with hopes of making noise nationally this season, today’s game will be a good test to see how ready Santa Barbara is at this early stage. The Gauchos should be ready to go without injuries keeping key players out of the lineup, as they did for significant amounts of time last season.</p>\n<p>“[Freshman defender Sam Strong] will be a really good addition to our backline. He’s a player that we need in this kind of game,” Vom Steeg said. “Everybody else is in pretty good shape. There may be a couple of changes but it’ll be close to the starting group we had against Westmont.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff against Stanford is set for 7:30 p.m. tonight at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64594\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/soccer-season-kicks-off-with-home-match-against-no-8-stanford/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64594\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/soccer-season-kicks-off-with-home-match-against-no-8-stanford/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/soccer-season-kicks-off-with-home-match-against-no-8-stanford/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/soccer-season-kicks-off-with-home-match-against-no-8-stanford/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-28/soccer-season-kicks-off-with-home-match-against-no-8-stanford/","id":1523,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1522,1521,1520],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Determined To End Winning Drought","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Gauchos and Spartans' set for Friday showdown at Harder Stadium ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_56798\" style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"230043448\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64591\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56798\" data-attachment-id=\"56798\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-13/womens-soccer/wsoccer_vsucd-dustinharris-10122014-05/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?fit=1600%2C1177&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1177\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1413120587\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"115\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?fit=250%2C184&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?fit=888%2C653&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-56798\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WSoccer_vsUCD-DustinHarris-10122014-05.jpg?resize=310%2C228\" alt=\"Sophomore forward Amanda Ball striking for the goal.

A team stacked with 18 returning upper classmen, the Gauchos are ready for the challenge and look to take it to their conference opponents.</p>\n<p>“Passion, accountability, and commitment,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said when asked what the core values of his women’s soccer team are. Heading into his 17<sup>th</sup> season at UCSB, Stumpf could not be more excited for this young talented crew and their chances in the Big West this year.</p>\n<p>With a tough non-conference schedule lined up and Big West competition around the corner, Stumpf believes his team’s values will be the key to their success this season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I feel like this team is going to be defined by [these traits]”, Stumpf said. “Our team chemistry has exceeded others in the past couple years and the quality of our soccer is good enough to win games.”</p>\n<p>After losing two consecutive games on the road at Saint Mary’s and USF, Stumpf does not see UCSB’s 0-2 start as a signal of a losing year.</p>\n<p>“We completely dominated possession and shots in our first game and we lost two to nothing. I don’t expect that to happen in the future,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Despite being held scoreless in their last two defeats, the Gauchos have worked out their kinks in practice and are using their losses as motivation for their matchup against San Jose State this Friday.</p>\n<p>“One thing to take out of those losses is we didn’t score a goal in 180 minutes,” Stumpf said. “We’re facing a very good San Jose State team and this is going to be a game where we will get a few opportunities at the box. We’re looking for someone who can come up with one special moment in front of the goal.”</p>\n<p>The Spartans head into Harder Stadium with a 1-1 overall record. Although SJSU is a non-conference opponent, Stumpf believes these matches are exactly what UCSB needs in preparation for the team’s in-conference games.</p>\n<p>“We felt like getting a diverse group of coaching styles in the non-conference would help us with all the different styles we are going to see in the Big West,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>As far as players on the team, Stumpf anticipates an identity to be established in the front line, especially from sophomore forward Amanda Ball.</p>\n<p>“Amanda has some great athleticism to her and is a very explosive player,” Stumpf said. “She’s had a couple lingering injuries that hindered her training, but we’re slowly but surely opening up her minutes and making her game fit.”</p>\n<p>As a freshman, Ball stepped up and started seven games for the Gauchos scoring two game-winning goals. She was the offensive anchor last Sunday, breaking down USF defenders and taking four of the Gauchos’ five shot attempts.</p>\n<p>Other notables include junior midfielder Sara Feder and senior forward Angelisa Cortez.</p>\n<p>Coming off a knee injury her sophomore year, Feder hit the ground running during her redshirt season starting 15 matches for the Gauchos and scoring a team-high five goals. The Colorado native earned recognition for her play by earning Honorable Mention All-Big West honors.</p>\n<p>In her final season in a blue and gold uniform, Cortez hopes her impressive play from last season can carry on to the field this year.

Then, in 2010, one of the greatest goalscorers of our time in former French national and Arsenal legend Thierry Henry followed in Beckham’s footsteps by leaving Lionel Messi and FC Barcelona to play for the New York Red Bulls.</p>\n<p>In more recent days, there has been an eruption of stunning moves. Coinciding with the United States’ increased fan interest in soccer (thanks for making such a great videogame, FIFA), we’ve seen American nationals Clint Dempsey, Michael Bradley, Jozy Altidore, Jermaine Jones and Mix Diskerud all make the move back to home soil. Former FIFA World Player of the Year Kaká, Chelsea legend Didier Drogba, and Italy’s Sebastian Giovinco are just a few more of the big names that have joined the league in the past year.</p>\n<p>And you can’t forget Los Angeles’ very own Giovani dos Santos of the Mexican national team, who has been absolutely killing it for the Galaxy.</p>\n<p>Back to the game. It was evident even in pregame warm-ups who the best players on the pitch were, with Pirlo and Villa in a class all on their own. However, that didn’t stop a Galaxy side that has played together for some time from absolutely dominating the last 75 minutes.</p>\n<p>Pirlo looked like a parent playing with his kid’s youth team. Every time he touched the ball it was magnificent. He seemed to always find the right man, with one-touch passes finding their mark nearly every time.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, he didn’t have much help, and the game quickly fell out of his and a frustrated Villa’s hands as dos Santos, Gerrard and reigning MLS MVP Robbie Keane celebrated goals for most of the second half.</p>\n<p>Still, when Pirlo was subbed out late in the second half, he received a heartwarming standing ovation from a Los Angeles crowd that was happy just to be able to witness firsthand his incredible talent. Villa capped his day off by scoring a classy, well-deserved penalty, making the final score 5-1 and improving his mark to 15 goals in 22 appearances for NYC.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the all-important question: what is it about MLS that is enticing enough for these players to make the move across the Atlantic, where the sport they’ve called football their entire lives doesn’t even go by the same name anymore?</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64502\" style=\"width: 231px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"789174628\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64497\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64502\" data-attachment-id=\"64502\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-24/la-vs-nyc-british-invasion-symbolizes-new-era-and-rise-of-mls/image-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?fit=620%2C350&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"620,350\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?fit=620%2C350&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64502 \" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?resize=221%2C125\" alt=\"image\" width=\"221\" height=\"125\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?w=620&amp;ssl=1 620w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64502\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">David Villa (right) is Spain’s all-time leading goalscorer (59 goals) / Photo courtesy of mlssoccer.com</p></div>\n<p>Well, for one, as is evidenced by Villa’s high goalscoring rate and the fact that the Galaxy have tallied four or more goals in five of their last 10 league games, the defending in MLS is not quite at the same level as it is in Europe. Aging stars who can no longer easily beat the younger, defensive studs that Europe has to offer can find solace knowing that they can still make a significant impact over here. This goes hand-in-hand with the tendencies of American crowds to be number-centric, awarding praise to those who are able to provide objective, statistical truths as to why they are the best rather than through actual observation.</p>\n<p>Another key factor is the absence of relegation in MLS. While in top leagues such as La Liga and the English Premier League teams finishing in the bottom three spots of the standings are moved down to a lower division the following season, MLS teams can simply look to rebuild and start fresh after a disappointing campaign. This takes away from the stress that players in Europe feel every year about playing for a club that might not even be in the same league they signed up for in a few months.</p>\n<p>And, despite the negative connotation America holds in many parts of the world, players who have played overseas their entire lives can get a ticket not only to live in a country as great as the U.S., but to play the sport they love and get paid top dollar doing it. Not to mention, even if a player is at an away game, he’ll still most likely receive more praise than hate – the fans are happy enough to be able to see them play at all. Also, people like being praised.</p>\n<p>The most important thing that MLS provides these players though, as Steven Gerrard has <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2015/01/07/steven-gerrard-im-leaving-liverpool-for-la-galaxy-to-win-trophies-5012612/\">made clear ever since he decided to play for LA</a>, is the chance to compete for something that matters.</p>\n<p>Now more than ever in the U.S., soccer is important. Everywhere you go, people are more interested and more knowledgeable in the sport than they ever have been. The USWNT just won the World Cup, and it made record-breaking viewership numbers in doing so. FIFA is the best-selling videogame franchise in the world of sports.</p>\n<p>The talent levels and competition, the viewership and overall interest, the amount of monetary investment, and the overall perception of MLS and U.S. soccer are all on the rise. The league just made the jump from 18 teams to 20 this past season and has plans to add at least four more franchises in the coming years.</p>\n<p>It takes money to make anything happen, especially in an underdog league. Luckily, ownership in MLS has shown an increased willingness to spend. NYCFC itself is owned by Manchester City, perhaps the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes%27_list_of_the_most_valuable_football_clubs\">highest roller</a> in the Premier League at this point.</p>\n<p>Looking at where MLS was back in 2007 – when David Beckham announced he was moving to LA – to where it is now, the future is as bright as ever. The more teams start reeling in big names and improving the level of competition, the more that soccer culture in America will only continue to rise.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64497\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-24/la-vs-nyc-british-invasion-symbolizes-new-era-and-rise-of-mls/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64497\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-24/la-vs-nyc-british-invasion-symbolizes-new-era-and-rise-of-mls/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-24/la-vs-nyc-british-invasion-symbolizes-new-era-and-rise-of-mls/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-24/la-vs-nyc-british-invasion-symbolizes-new-era-and-rise-of-mls/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-24/la-vs-nyc-british-invasion-symbolizes-new-era-and-rise-of-mls/","id":1525,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1524,1523,1522],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
