It figured to be a favorable matchup for UCSB, as the men had won their past eleven matches, while the women claimed a five-match win streak against the Mustangs. The Gauchos also defeated their rival earlier in the season in their first match with a final score of 171-123 on the women’s side and 161-129 on the men’s side.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thankfully for the Gauchos, their swimmers continued their outstanding trend and came out with the victory against the Mustangs with the scores being 190.5-101.5 for the men and 165-129 for the women. This extends the men’s win streak over the Mustangs to twelve while the women now own a six game win streak against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Junior freestyle/IM events swimmer Billy Mullis performed outstanding once again for the Gauchos as he went on to win two individual events against the Mustangs. He took first place in the 200 yard freestyle with a time of 1:39.66 and another victory in the 200 yard backstroke with a time of 1:45.75.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p dir=\"ltr\">Junior Sprint Freestyle swimmer Cheyenne Low also had a solid performance for the women. She took two individual victories against the Mustangs and won the 100 yard backstroke with a time of 55:63. Low also worked the field and took the victory in the 200 yard backstroke with a time of 2:00.99 to give her two first place solo victories on the day.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mullin and Low are only two swimmers of the many on the talented Gauchos roster that contributed to this fantastic victory. Julia Mikota (23.90) won the 50 yard women freestyle with a time of 23.90 and she also won another event in the 100 yard freestyle with a time of 51.86. Another large contributor to this victory for the Gauchos was their relay teams. At the beginning of the meet, the men’s “A”  relay took first in the 200 yard medley relay with a time of 1:30.26, while the women’s “A” relay also took first in the same event with a time of 1:43.74. Towards the end of the match, the women’s A relay again stole a victory with a time of 3:30.10, and their “B” relay was right behind them with a second place time of 3:33.27.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This victory gives the Gauchos swim teams two excellent records to finish the season, with the men ending with a 5-2 record and the women finishing with a 5-1 record, respectively. This win only added to the amazing regular seasons that the two Gaucho swim teams had, and to demoralize their rivals in the final regular season game truly seems to be the cherry on top.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Overall, this was a big win for the Gauchos and gives them tremendous momentum going into the at MPSF Championship, which will be taking place in February. This regular season was also a large stepping stone for what could be in store in the postseason. The Gaucho swim teams seem to have the recipe for success, and it seems as if they could definitely make a deep run the way they’re tearing up the pool as of late. It should be fun to watch, as the mixture of youth, experience, talent, and dedication is all coming together for the Gauchos at the perfect time of the season.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The rest of the Gaucho swim season starts with the MPSF Championship, which will take place in East Los Angeles, California. This Championship, which are all day events and do not have specific start times, starts on <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_1366519119\"><span class=\"aQJ\">February 15</span></span>, and lasts until <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_1366519120\"><span class=\"aQJ\">February 18</span></span>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75481\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-31/gauchos-demolish-rival-mustangs-in-final-meet/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75481\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-31/gauchos-demolish-rival-mustangs-in-final-meet/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-31/gauchos-demolish-rival-mustangs-in-final-meet/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-31/gauchos-demolish-rival-mustangs-in-final-meet/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-31/gauchos-demolish-rival-mustangs-in-final-meet/","id":1790,"author":{"id":312,"name":"DJ Rubalcava"},"related":[1789,1788,1787],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":312,"name":"DJ Rubalcava","biography":"Not available","articles":[1781,1787,1790,1791,1832,1834,3341],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Run The Table in Vegas","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Swim and Dive","publish_date":"2017-01-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/01-15-SwimSeniorDay-EricSwensonNexus-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/01-15-SwimSeniorDay-EricSwensonNexus-7-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It was an eventful weekend for both the UCSB men's and women's swim teams as the men continued their winning streak, while the women got back on the winning track.

Another stupendous contributor for the Gauchos was freshman Heaven Quintana, who was blazing fast, and put up times many swimmers would be envious of. She put up times of 29.05 in the 50 yard breaststroke, 1:02.17 in the 100 yard breaststroke, and 2:18.85 in the 200 yard breaststroke.</p>\n<p>The whole team thrived off of the energy of these young swimmers, and the team ultimately wound up with a first place team victory that was no doubt a collective team effort.</p>\n<p>Headlining the competition with two victories, the Gaucho men’s team handled the competition. They were able to capture a win over UNLV, and they seemed to do it with ease with a lopsided score of 173 to 120.</p>\n<p>Against the Air Force Academy, this match proved to be much more difficult. With the Gauchos staring adversity in the face, down 32 points, they somehow, someway willed themselves back for a comeback that many did not see coming.</p>\n<p>The men were able to use grit and determination, backed by some clutch performances, to narrowly snatch the win right out from under  the Air Force Academy’s nose. This gutsy performance led to a final victory with a score of 148-146, with the Gauchos finding satisfaction in ruining perfection with the Air Force suffering its first loss and snapping the Academy’s undefeated season.</p>\n<p>This was only half of the competition, and while the men were enjoying this outstanding weekend, the women weren’t too shabby themselves. They were able to showcase their youth and athleticism with many young Gauchos showing that they are going to be a force to be reckoned with going forward.</p>\n<p>The women were able to seal the deal with a final score of 159.5-126.5, and were able to truly bounce back after a week against Pacific in which they suffered their first loss of the season.</p>\n<p>The men and women are hoping to use these victories to fuel them in what is definitely going to be a tough week in front of them.

Col. Martin E. Stokes said.</p>\n<p>0520 hours: The first formation of the day lines up for inspection while the stars provide the only light. It is here that both schools are divided equally into two platoons consisting of three squads each. The idea is to practice the formations, commands and protocol necessary for an officer in the Army.</p>\n<p>“Right face!” commands second platoon Sgt. Damaris Sanders. With this order, the long day ensues as the cadets undertake a full schedule of exercises aimed at team building and officer field experience.</p>\n<p>“The Fall FTX is really our recruiting event,” Stokes said. “The aim is not only to help train our cadets, but to offer a hands on experience to students who are interested in joining ROTC.”</p>\n<p><b><big>Move, Move Move!</big></b></p>\n<p>0600: The cadets arrive at the obstacle course, a 15-minute march from the barracks. The headlights from three cars light the course for the next hour, until the sun finally rises. The dew from the previous evening leaves the course wet and treacherous.</p>\n<p>First Class Sgt. Stephen Hall of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo says the course is monitored closely.</p>\n<p>“Most importantly, we don’t want anyone to get hurt,” Hall said.</p>\n<p>The course is just what you would expect from the Army, with an eerie similarity to the Bill Murray film “Stripes” with rope climbs, barbed wire, balance beams and walls to jump over that lead up to a huge ditch invisible in the dark.</p>\n<p>“Don’t forget to jump over the ditch,” Hall reminds the battalion. Spotters from each battalion are placed along each obstacle to ensure that no one gets hurt.</p>\n<p>The slow rise of the sun marks the end of morning exercises. The battalion marches back to the barracks for inspection and then to the mess hall for a hot breakfast.</p>\n<p><b><big>Paintball and Rappelling</big></b></p>\n<p>“They say that [the Army] does more before 9 a.m. than most people do all day,” Stokes says following the hectic morning. “This morning isn’t any different.”</p>\n<p>0900 hours: The morning’s events have led the cadets to the Gladiator Paintball Park on the other side of the post. The next five hours are spent playing paintball on the two large urban-style courses in the park in which teams of 20 cadets battle it out in a death match fashion.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year law and society major Nat Higgins leads the group, gathering up fellow cadets for a charge up the left flank. However, this paintball match is not like the ones on Fox Sports Network West, as soldiers take their time holding points and keeping cover. Every hit is done carefully and precisely, as if it were real.</p>\n<p>Higgins said the five-hour paintball session, besides being a good time, is helpful in both building camaraderie amongst the ROTC cadets and strengthening individual leadership and tactical skills.</p>\n<p>“Paintball really is all about teamwork,” Higgins said. “These exercises help us in working together, although of course it’s not like a real firefight.”</p>\n<p>Each soldier is completely covered in paint – one Cal Poly cadet has a welt the size of a golf ball on his neck from the second match. Not even the Daily Nexus photographer can avoid catching a few paintballs in the crossfire.</p>\n<p>1400 hours: The battalion makes it to Fort Merriam for some rappelling exercises. Here, cadets simulate a real life rappelling situation by rappelling down a rocky cliff face.</p>\n<p>Miles Tatum, a third-year history major and aspiring JAG for the U.S. Army, said he was glad to practice rappelling at the FTX.</p>\n<p>“Should we ever find ourselves overseas in this position, it’s good to have practiced it,” Tatum said. “This is all just one big learning experience.”</p>\n<p>Despite the long weekends and hefty amount of hours put into the ROTC, Tatum said that these exercises have become routine for him.</p>\n<p>“Military science and ROTC is now just an extra curricular activity, although it will soon be my life,” Tatum said. “I have still been able to have my college experience, going to DP on the weekends and having fun.”</p>\n<p><b><big>Chow</big></b></p>\n<p>When it is time for food on the post, it is almost certainly on the go, thanks to an Army invention known as the Meal Ready to Eat. The lightweight MRE is a completely portable meal soldiers use out in the field when they are without access to kitchen services. The 24 different meals in the MRE arsenal are given out at random, the favorites including Chili with Beans, Hamburger Beef Patty, Chicken Salsa and Tuna in Pouch.</p>\n<p>“I’ve had thousands of these,” Master Sgt. James Thorpe said, referring to the MREs as cadets take turns devouring 3,000-calorie meals between paintball matches.</p>\n<p>Each MRE comes complete with a flameless heater – a pouch that heats up contents placed inside it solely by adding water. A chemical reaction inside brings the small amount of water to boil.</p>\n<p>Second-year history major Chris Torrez said as long as the food has beef in the title, he is good to go.</p>\n<p>“My favorite is beef stew,” Torrez said. “But I mean, these are MREs; you have to learn to love them.</p>\n<p><b><big>The Cadre</big></b></p>\n<p>In 2005, several UCSB students and professors rallied against ROTC and attempted to ban the group’s presence from campus via a resolution sent to the Academic Senate. The protesters wanted to remove ROTC from campus because they disagreed with the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, which stipulates that its recruits are to keep their sexual orientation private.</p>\n<p>Although the resolution failed, Stokes, who is the new head military instructor for UCSB’s ROTC program, said he has vowed to create a new, positive attitude on campus about the ROTC. He said he plans on improving communication and publicity of the for the program.</p>\n<p>“I feel like I can really give to these students,” Stokes said. “I’ve given 18 years of my life to serve my country. I, too, started my military career in ROTC at [the University of] Nebraska-Lincoln, and I admire these students for the four years they are willing to put into [ROTC].”</p>\n<p>Thorpe, a soldier with more than 18 years of experience, keeps a watchful eye on the cadets from the sidelines.</p>\n<p>“I like to be stern with them, but I want them to work with me,” Thorpe said. “They need to know that I’m serious, but they [also] have to know you care.”</p>\n<p>Thorpe said he is a firm believer in leading by example. He still posts perfect scores of 300 on the Army’s physical fitness test, which includes running 2 miles in 10 minutes and 50 seconds.</p>\n<p>“If you can’t teach what you know, you ain’t nothing to the Army,” Thorpe said.</p>\n<p><b><big>To the Shooting Range</big></b></p>\n<p>0800 hours: “Fire when ready!” shouts Sgt. Jeremy Brown, among a team of ROTC cadets armed with M-16 A2s. The weapons resonate harmoniously as the cadets blow off round after round toward the target.</p>\n<p>It’s now Sunday, and the FTX has split into two different groups: Ranger Challenge and the rest of the FTX participants. After receiving breakfast, the Ranger Challenge team makes its way to the firing range as the remaining cadets stay back to clean the barracks.</p>\n<p>“If your weapon jams up, call for me,” Brown says, urging cadets not to make a dire mistake with their weapons. “Don’t try to fix it yourself.”</p>\n<p>Out on the range, both Thorpe and Brown are teaching skills for next week’s Ranger Challenge competition, an annual contest in which UCSB, UCLA, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and CSU Fresno compete in different disciplines.</p>\n<p>As the firing squad team members continue to work on their accuracy, zeroing the site on their weapons, second-year economics major Kevin Higuchi practices his aim for the Ranger Challenge Competition.</p>\n<p>“[Shooting] is really the epitome of the Army outdoor activities, as far as cadets go,” Higuchi said.</p>\n<p>Cadets fire in two-person groups, with the shooter alternating after firing a certain number of rounds. The pairs fire upon fixed targets marked by numbered lanes. Brown said breathing is the main cause of soldiers missing the target during practice.</p>\n<p>“When you breathe in, your entire body moves and that moves your gun,” Brown said. “You have to exhale before you shoot.”</p>\n<p><b><big>A Coalition of One</big></b></p>\n<p>Amid the political strife accompanying the U.S. Military Operation Iraqi Freedom, cadets in the ROTC who are graduating within the next few years are almost guaranteed to be stationed in the Middle East at some pont. Higgins said he does not expect everyone to support the mission in Iraq, but he said he urges them to support U.S. troops in general.</p>\n<p>“When people look at me and say that I’m a baby-killer, I just say that I’m just a guy trying to pay for college,” Higgins said. “The Army has its humanitarian side, too, and many jobs are outside of combat.”</p>\n<p>Higgins said he is aspiring to become a military police officer.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Stokes said the ROTC program at UCSB is a very helpful option for many college students</p>\n<p>“We offer scholarships to pay for either tuition or room and board,” Stokes said. “We also offer stipends for school fees, for example a $400 books stipend per year.”</p>\n<p>ROTC trains college students to become officers in the U.S. Army in fields ranging from infantry and artillery to medicine and engineering. Stokes said ROTC offers students the opportunity to improve their leadership capabilities and to make themselves more attractive in the job market.</p>\n<p>“These guys all know that they may end up in either Iraq or Afghanistan,” Stokes said. “If you can handle the stress of the Army, chances are you can handle the stress of a desk.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-14870\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-24/serving-with-the-surfriders/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-14870\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-24/serving-with-the-surfriders/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-24/serving-with-the-surfriders/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-24/serving-with-the-surfriders/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-24/serving-with-the-surfriders/","id":1789,"author":{"id":342,"name":"Benjamin Gottlieb"},"related":[1788,1787,1786],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
