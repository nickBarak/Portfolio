The vigil provided a space to “leave feelings behind.” <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) hosted a candlelight vigil in Storke Plaza Wednesday evening to provide a space for students, staff and residents of Isla Vista to honor lives lost to suicide.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. members placed over fifty white paper bags containing tea lights along the steps leading into Storke Plaza for the vigil, upon which volunteers and attendees wrote words of remembrance. Students and I.V. community members paid their respects at the event and released floating lanterns into the Storke Plaza pond.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. psychology intern Shannon Hackett said she was inspired to host the event by students at UC Irvine who held a similar candlelight vigil to honor victims of suicide. According to Hackett, students need spaces to discuss their losses and to share tragedy preventative measures.</p>\n<p>“I think that this is something that really just meets a need at UCSB,” Hackett said. “We lose students pretty much every year either to accidental death or to suicide and it’s a way to just give people a space to honor people.”</p>\n<p>Hackett also said she hopes the vigil was a place for survivors to “leave feelings behind” and participate in healing interactions.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the times we’re talking more about prevention or intervention and there’s not a lot of time to talk about those that we have lost,” Hackett said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major and C.A.P.S. student health peer Melina Mossberg said the candlelight vigil was meant to welcome a variety of students, not just those who have lost someone to suicide. Mossberg also said she hopes to continue hosting events that will adapt to meet the needs of the UCSB community in the future.</p>\n<p>“This is the first time and we’re trying it out and, hopefully, this will be something that we’ll continue doing in the future,” Mossberg said. “People will always have this space and they’ll have an opportunity to come and even just be allies if they haven’t lost somebody.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think it’s important for survivors, for the people who are here, to be able to honor the person that they’ve lost and also to just raise awareness about suicide, just so they know people care. – C.A.P.S. Director Jeanne Stanford</p></blockquote>\n<p>C.A.P.S. Director Jeanne Stanford said C.A.P.S. hopes to host similar events during Suicide Prevention Month in the fall to continue providing an outlet for people to support each other and share their experiences.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important for survivors, for the people who are here, to be able to honor the person that they’ve lost and also to just raise awareness about suicide, just so they know people care,” Stanford said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and psychology double major Nelson Moreno said the vigil was another step towards the removal of the stigma surrounding mental health issues, and served to bring students together, especially given the May 11 Sabado Tarde incident.</p>\n<p>“It’s been done in other UCs and I think having it here in Santa Barbara will promote an understanding and compassion toward people that have completed suicide,” Moreno said. “I think this month can be very triggering to students especially with the tragedy.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Janice Ong said students need opportunities to discuss sensitive issues such as suicide at events like the candlelight vigil.</p>\n<p>“It helps students understand and gives them a safe space to talk,” Ong said. “I feel like suicide is not talked about a lot; it’s really sensitive and … this gives a safe and healing space for students who have maybe experienced any of that in their life.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of the Thursday, May 14, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

<em>Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>­­­</p>\n<p>Residence halls Multicultural Awareness Chairs held a discussion Wednesday titled “Where Are We Now?” to explore students’ healing processes following the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>The Multicultural Awareness Chairs chose the theme “You Can Sit with Us” to foster inclusive discussion. Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) Training Director Juan Riker led a discussion in which students shared feelings on the upcoming May 23 anniversary and the May 11 Sabado Tarde Road incident. Students signed chalkboards as a symbol of solidarity.</p>\n<p>San Rafael Hall Multicultural Awareness Chair and second-year sociology major Curnishia Woodbury said freshman students are often alienated from the rest of the UCSB community because they did not experience the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“There is this empathy gap between us and the freshmen who are new here,” Woodbury said.</p>\n<p>According to Woodbury, open discussions are important because they expose how past events continue to affect people’s lives.</p>\n<p>“Problems are still here,” Woodbury said. “Spring Quarter last year, it was like everybody said ‘how are you?’ but Fall Quarter rolls around and everybody is back to like ‘Hey, I.V., let’s go party.’ They are still perpetuating the same problems that existed before.”</p>\n<p>Woodbury said the group also addressed why society tends to shame men who express their feelings, discussing what it means to be masculine and how society is “perpetuating” a male-dominated society.</p>\n<p>“I hoped that people would keep the dialogue going, keep talking about what masculinity means — what does femininity mean?” Woodbury said. “What are we doing here in this I.V. community? Why do we still perpetuate these same norms when we could change it after what happened?”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Women tend to be diagnosed with depression, whereas men tend to externalize versus internalize their feelings. – C.A.P.S. Training Director Juan Riker</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Riker, attendees discussed how women share emotions more frequently and are more likely to be diagnosed with depression.</p>\n<p>“Women tend to be diagnosed with depression, whereas men tend to externalize versus internalize their feelings,” Riker said.</p>\n<p>Riker said C.A.P.S. encourages students to seek out counseling services during the week of May 23.</p>\n<p>“It is important to stress support and not being alone,” Woodbury said.</p>\n<p>Riker said his repressed emotions from the events of May 23 last year may have been triggered by the May 11 Sabado Tarde Road incident.</p>\n<p>“Clearly, that shook all of us — just wrapping our minds around that happening again,” Riker said.</p>\n<p>Second-year black studies and sociology double major Chika Anyiw said the chalkboards students signed will be displayed at San Rafael and Manzanita Residence Halls.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of the chalkboards is to distribute them, have one be in San Rafael somewhere and the other one be in Manzanita by the central front desk it and if not give it to OSL [Office of Student Life] and then OSL would choose to place it somewhere on campus,” Anyiw said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, May 14, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

senior to Facebook and Buzzfeed celebrity as a result of the enormous following his senior flute recital has gathered.</p>\n<p>His Facebook event page, “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/874090079303714/\" target=\"_blank\">Azeem’s Senior Flute Recital</a>,” has over 41,000 people listed as “going,” and that number is continually on the rise. Following this incredible and almost instantaneous explosion in popularity, an article posted by Buzzfeed helped to rocket Azeem to the forefront of, strangely enough, British media.</p>\n<p>Azeem said this whole ordeal started when he made his Facebook event public instead of private.</p>\n<p>“I guess when you make public events, they go viral now or something. If you read the description it just says ‘please come out and support,’” Azeem said. “I invited like 600 friends, but in the beginning, it was just like 70 people going, and at the end of the day, it was 120 people going and this guy from England, the UK — Damon Poole — was one of the first people to repost and then repost again.”</p>\n<p>Azeem said he doesn’t know Poole and has not been able to reach him either. According to Azeem, the event page “took off” following Poole’s repost.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know him and, at that point, random people started commenting ‘Yea Azeem!’ ‘You’re gonna kill it!’ ‘It’s gonna go off,’” Azeem said. “And then I started seeing the memes, you know, like me on the moon with girls and stuff.”</p>\n<p>All this popularity, though, came from out of the blue, Azeem said.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t do anything,” Azeem said. “One night it was 150 [people attending the event], last night 12k and now it’s like 40k … Just out of nowhere.”</p>\n<p>Azeem said, despite the newfound internet fame that he has found, the recital is really about the music for him.</p>\n<p>“I’m just here trying to do my thing, you know, play the flute,” Azeem said. “It’s a standard flute recital, you know?

and question and answer session in the MultiCultural Center on Thursday as part of the week-long “We’re fUCked” campaign to protest the proposed UC system tuition hikes.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, UC President Janet Napolitano announced that Governor Jerry Brown and the UC agreed on a revised state budget proposal titled “May Revise,” which will freeze UC tuition for the next two years. Graduate and undergraduate students, Office of Financial Aid representatives, professors, KCSB staff members and Associated Students (A.S.) attended the We’re fUCked discussion, addressing issues regarding tuition hikes and how the May Revise will affect students.</p>\n<p>Though tuition is now frozen for in-state students over the next two years, tuition for out-of-state residents will increase by eight percent per year, according to UCSB Director of Financial Aid and Scholarships Michael Miller.</p>\n<p>“Every student pays the mandatory UC tuition, which is $12,192,” Miller said. “Non-residents supplemental tuition is an additional $24,000 on top of that. Eight percent is definitely not good news for out-of-state students, and we can’t give out-of-state students any more financial aid than we do our California students.”</p>\n<p>According Miller, UCSB has the highest campus-based fees of all the UC campuses with a total cost of $25,836 for a student living on campus, $12,192 of which is for tuition.</p>\n<p>“Our campus-based fees are $1,673 — that is certainly concerning,” Miller said. “One of the other fees that’s really concerning is the Gaucho Health Insurance, which is over $2,700. Just a few years ago, it was $1,375, so that’s been a massive, massive increase.”</p>\n<p>Miller said while about 70 percent of UCSB students receive some form of financial aid, UCSB should allocate more money for scholarships.</p>\n<p>“One area we really need a lot of work on is scholarships,” Miller said. “We only administer about $13.2 million worth of scholarships and, of that, $4.1 come from outside agencies.”</p>\n<p>Gevirtz School graduate student of education and co-host of KCSB’s “Radio Occupy” Kathy Swift said the 2008 market crash created a “tuition crisis” of trillions of dollars in student debt, the highest of any single consumer debt within the U.S.</p>\n<p>“Basically, we have a situation in which we have austerity across the United States, and it’s finally starting to trickle down to the university system,” Swift said. “Student debt and student loans have become the most pressing area of consumer debt in the United States. It surpassed every other area of consumer debt.”</p>\n<p>Swift said the debt students are accumulating while obtaining higher education is negatively affecting their daily lifestyles, which goes against the “American Dream.”</p>\n<p>“Students are so desperate that we have to provide food banks for them, and some students are living out of their cars and in less-than-good housing situations,” Swift said. “This is madness.”</p>\n<p>According to Swift, the tuition crisis the millennial generation is facing stifles upward mobility because many cannot afford to pursue a higher education.</p>\n<p>“The mission statement of California says we should all be guaranteed higher education,” Swift said. “That’s not really the case anymore. That social contract is gone now.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63457\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63457\" data-attachment-id=\"63457\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/mcc-may-14th-2015/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,401\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Hari Patel\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D600\",\"caption\":\"MCC, May 14th, 2015.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1431618847\",\"copyright\":\"Hari Patel\\/Daily Nexus\",\"focal_length\":\"110\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"MCC, May 14th, 2015.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MCC, May 14th, 2015.\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63457\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?resize=600%2C401\" alt=\"Hari Patel/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63457\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Hari Patel/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB Chair and professor of black studies Jeffrey Stewart said the education policy has been changed to outsourcing universities while increasing funding for prisons.</p>\n<p>“The idea of neoliberalism has taken over to where everyone is now looked at as a private corporation,” Stewart said. “The larger dynamic is taxpayers in the state of California no longer think your education is worth their tax dollars. They feel more comfortable paying for prisons to lock up people.”</p>\n<p>Stewart also said the decision to stagnate tuition for two years is only a temporary solution to satisfy student concerns, and problems will still be present at the end of the freeze.</p>\n<p>“Freezing the tuition for two years only allows for the activists to graduate,” Stewart said. “It also leads you to believe that the current situation is acceptable, but it’s not. Where can we begin to organize to put political pressure on those who make those decisions?”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Jared Daniels said the UC creating a three-party system, under which funding methods are different for UC campuses, California State campuses and City College campuses, created a hierarchal system rather than facilitating collaboration between students.</p>\n<p>“Before this tri-party system, universities were a free-for-all, competing against one another for the funds the state could give them,” Daniels said. “So in 1960, the UC President and state government came together and passed what was known as the ‘master plan’ which established the three-party system based on accessibility and quality.”</p>\n<p>According to Daniels, the master plan did not provide long-term sustainable resources for revenue, and President Regan’s economic policies required students to pay for education as opposed to the government providing public education.</p>\n<p>“We were just always hoping that California taxpayers would be willing to pay higher taxes for the system and we always figured the politicians would find the money,” Daniels said. “But obviously that’s not quite the case.”</p>\n<p>EVPSA policy analyst and fourth-year political science major Brett Carpenter said the UC is admitting a greater percentage of students from out-of-state to increase funding.</p>\n<p>“We’re admitting more and more of them into our schools each year,” Carpenter said. “That’s because we get a lot of money from them and the out-of-state tuition goes straight to the campus. There is a very identifiable incentive to take more of those people.”</p>\n<p>According to Carpenter, privatization of universities devalues a Bachelor’s degree, making it difficult to get a job after graduation, which incentivizes students to pursue post-undergraduate education.</p>\n<p>“The UC really has no interest in getting you a job after graduation,” Carpenter said. “Why? Because you can come back and pay them for a Master’s degree. They want to provide us with the lowest cost education they can while extracting from us the most money.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63467\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63467\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/","id":2748,"author":{"id":160,"name":"Alyssa Schmidt"},"related":[2747,2746,2745],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
