Yet, she established herself this year as an elite player in the Big West, leading the league in shutouts and becoming the centerpiece of the Gaucho defense. What seems more improbable is that none of it should have happened.</p>\n<p>A career-ending injury to starting senior goalkeeper Makenna Henry in the beginning of the season gave way to Ritter emerging as UCSB’s goalkeeper of the future. With one collegiate career beginning and the other coming to an end, something special between Ritter and Henry developed through the course of the season: a relationship strengthened by adversity and friendship.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Mak is my number one role model on this team,” Ritter said. “I learned so much from her work ethic and her desire to play well and get better every single day … she’s the captain of our team, so she leads like no other and I just try to be like her as much as possible.”</p>\n<p>Although they are two years apart in age, the two have a lot more in common other than just being goalkeepers for the Gauchos. In fact, going back to last season, the two have shared a common bond with one another.</p>\n<p>In Ritter’s first year, she sat out the entire year as a redshirt freshman recovering from knee surgery. Before that, Ritter did not play in her final two years in high school because of knee injuries suffered before. With five knee surgeries in total, Ritter did not know if she would ever step onto the field again.</p>\n<p>“It was hard in college to watch my team play and not really be a part of it other than just a cheerleading aspect,” Ritter said.</p>\n<p>While Ritter was recovering during her first year, Henry suffered a right knee injury during a pre-conference game that severely limited her abilities. Henry toughened out the injury for the entire season even though she was forced to play with a knee brace.</p>\n<p>That knee brace brought with it its challenges: a reduction in her mobility, agility and even how she kicked the ball. Yet, one player was always there for Henry the entire season despite all the hard times.</p>\n<p>“I was struggling to get through season, [but Beth] was helping me all the way through, giving me little pick-me-ups here and there,” Henry said. “It was nice getting through a training session with someone who knew exactly what the struggles were.”</p>\n<p>Ritter knew exactly what those struggles were considering she had been dealing with knee injuries since high school and still at UCSB. For Ritter, her first year playing with Makenna was more than just learning and getting healthy; it was the start of her becoming a soccer player again.</p>\n<p>“[Makenna] used to bring me out when I was injured and work with me even if I couldn’t run, if I couldn’t dive,” Ritter said. “She would kick balls to my hand when no one else even acknowledged that I was on the team. She really set me up for the opportunity to start playing.”</p>\n<p>Flash-forward to this year and a fully healthy Ritter is able to finally play soccer for the first time in years, making her UCSB debut in the second game of the season against Weber State in a 1-1 draw.</p>\n<p>What she originally thought was going to be a year of cheerleading on the bench suddenly became a lot more when Henry could no longer go on playing injured.</p>\n<p>In her first game taking over for Henry versus Pacific University, Ritter had to deal with the usual nervousness, but instead of concentrating on herself, Ritter kept one person in mind the entire time.</p>\n<p>“What was really going through my mind was don’t let [Makenna] down. You’re playing for her right now,” Ritter said. “That’s all I needed to tell myself, play for Makenna, because as long as you focus on that, you’re not going to worry about yourself and worry about your decisions. I knew she would be proud of me if I played well.”</p>\n<p>Not only did UCSB win that game in overtime 1-0, Ritter was correct in making Henry proud of her when she revealed what she was thinking about during the game to Henry.</p>\n<p>“She actually did reveal that to me in one of our talks that we always have after our practices,” Henry said. “It’s a really huge honor to hear that from someone you respect as a person and as a goalkeeper. When she told me that, I was at a loss for words.”</p>\n<p>From that game on, Ritter showed what she was capable of accomplishing when fully healthy. Stepping in for Henry, Ritter had one of the best seasons by a UCSB goalkeeper ever recorded. At one point in the season Ritter had five straight shutouts, ending the season with the most in the Big West with eight and coming in second in save percentage at .826.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Ritter is quick to point out that it would not have been possible without her defenders and what she learned from Henry.</p>\n<p>“She took the time after practice to tell me how she always carries me with her out in the field,” Henry said. “Whatever influence I’ve had on her, either leading by example on and off the field, it was really cool to see her succeed like that and to know I had some positive effect on her success.”</p>\n<p>With Ritter now taking over the reins for UCSB, she remains as motivated as ever and does not take for granted any moment she is on the field, considering the years she spent off it.</p>\n<p>“In this weird way our injuries kept us closer together because we understood the challenges that came with being injured,” Henry said. “We were able to be each other’s support system and each other’s confidants.”</p>\n<p>If there ever was a case of injuries bringing a stroke of serendipity with it, look no further than Makenna Henry and Beth Ritter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of November 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The draw ended Santa Barbara’s seven-game winning streak, but secured the North Division for the Gauchos and kept them undefeated in conference play.</p>\n<p>Davis, meanwhile, fell 1-0 to last-place Sacramento State, but still remains alive for the second qualifying spot for the Big West Tournament out of the North division.</p>\n<p>“Davis is playing to get into the playoffs and that’s what happens when you play these last few games, there’s a playoff intensity about them,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “It makes for exciting games, it makes for usually really tight games.”</p>\n<p>Last time out against the Aggies, UCSB pulled out an exciting 3-2 double overtime victory in front of a raucous Davis crowd.</p>\n<p>“All these games are going to be tight because when you are familiar with each other you start to take things away from the other team,” Vom Steeg said. “They start to get pretty familiar with what you do and we’re familiar with what they do.”</p>\n<p>Despite the familiarity, UCSB still holds an advantage over Davis, ranking third in the conference in goals scored with 26 and first in goal allowed with 15. The Aggies, meanwhile, have scored the second fewest goals with 16, but have also allowed the third fewest with 16.</p>\n<p>“[Davis] is a team that has not won a game when they have been scored on once,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re comfortable coming back from being behind. They are undefeated after being ahead in the game and they have not won when they have fallen behind.”</p>\n<p>Ranked No. 7 in the RPI rankings, UCSB is seemingly in good position to clinch an NCAA appearance regardless of the results of the Big West Tournament. Santa Barbara, however, can strongly improve its standing if it can complete a historic undefeated conference schedule.</p>\n<p>“The key for us is we’re playing for what happens after the Big West,” Vom Steeg said. “We feel good about what’s going to happen over the next three games and where we stand, but the reality is it’s the conference tournament champion who gets the automatic selection. We need to be in a position where win or lose the conference tournament, we know we’re in the NCAA tournament.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff against UC Davis is scheduled for 7 p.m Saturday night at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 31, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52711\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/gauchos-host-davis-with-chance-to-clinch-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52711\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/gauchos-host-davis-with-chance-to-clinch-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/gauchos-host-davis-with-chance-to-clinch-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/gauchos-host-davis-with-chance-to-clinch-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/gauchos-host-davis-with-chance-to-clinch-big-west/","id":1587,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1586,1585,1584],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall in Blue-Green Rivalry","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.25.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-vs.-Cal-Poly-SLO-Peter-Vandenbelt-20.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.25.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-vs.-Cal-Poly-SLO-Peter-Vandenbelt-20.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB falls to rival Cal Poly on senior night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the only Blue-Green rivalry match of the season between the first and second place teams in the Big West, Cal Poly proved why they are in first place, defeating the UCSB women’s soccer team 2-1 on Friday in the final regular season game at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>Two second-half goals by the nation’s leading scorer, sophomore forward Elise Krieghoff, was enough to push the Mustangs past the Gauchos.

With the loss, UCSB drops to 9-8-1 overall and 3-4 in the conference. The defeat endangers the Gauchos’ chance of qualifying for the Big West Tournament for the first time since 2009. UCSB will need to at least win its next game against UC Davis to maintain any chance of qualifying for postseason play.</p>\n<p>It is the 12th time this season the Gauchos have been involved in a game decided by a one-goal margin, including all of its conference games.</p>\n<p>Despite emotions running high for the Gauchos after honoring their five seniors on Senior Night, UCSB came out flat in the first 15 minutes of the game. Under heavy pressure in the opening moments, Santa Barbara soon settled in to match Cal Poly’s intensity. With both sides playing evenly on both sides of the pitch, the game went scoreless into halftime.</p>\n<p>“There are extended periods where you have to weather the storm and after 15 or so minutes we weathered the storm,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “I think from then on the game was relatively even, but it did take us 15 or so minutes to match the energy.”</p>\n<p>It did not take long for Cal Poly to break the scoreless draw in the second half. Unable to score in any of her three shots taken in the first half, Krieghoff broke through in the 50th minute with a shot from outside of the box that lofted over sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter’s outstretched hand into the corner of the net.</p>\n<p>Just three minutes later, Krieghoff found the back of the net again for her 20th goal of the season. This time a breakdown resulted in Ritter leaving her goal early. Krieghoff sidestepped Ritter and had an open shot on goal to give Cal Poly a 2-0 advantage.</p>\n<p>“[In the] second half they just found their chances and put them away,” junior midfielder Miranda Cornejo said. “Honestly there was nothing we can do about [the first goal], it was about 30 yards out, a bender in the top so that was a tough one. [Kreighoff] is the number one scorer in the nation.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was not without its opportunities. Junior midfielder Madison Beckley had a shot rebound to her with the goalkeeper out of position and sent the ball just left of the open net. Not until the 80th minute did the Gauchos find the back of the net on a cross that connected with Beckley’s head, hitting the crossbar and pushed in by Ariniello. It was Ariniello’s team-high fifth goal.</p>\n<p>The last game of the regular season for UCSB will be a must-win road game at UC Davis on Sunday at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 28, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52639\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/gauchos-fall-in-blue-green-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52639\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/gauchos-fall-in-blue-green-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/gauchos-fall-in-blue-green-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/gauchos-fall-in-blue-green-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/gauchos-fall-in-blue-green-rivalry/","id":1586,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1585,1584,1583],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels to Davis With Postseason on the Line","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB's postseason hopes are on the line against Davis.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>One game holds the fate of the UCSB women’s soccer team.

We have to get a result if we want to continue,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “One of our goals all year has been to get to the Big West Tournament; clearly the only shot is to get a result, to get a win.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have overcome their recent injuries to remain in contention this late into the conference season. In its last game, UCSB played without as many as seven starters, including freshman defender Sydney Fuertes. Fuertes had previously started all games in the season before her injury.</p>\n<p>Filling in the gap on defense left by Fuertes has been freshman Kailey Hackett and sophomore Savannah Francis. Despite the inexperience of both players, they have been helped by the experience of senior defender Taylor Gehring, junior midfielder Miranda Cornejo and sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter. The trio has helped UCSB to the second best goals against average in the league (0.86).</p>\n<p>“The team has only conceded 16 goals out of 18 games,” Stumpf said. “I would say those three specifically have kept us in more games more than anything.”</p>\n<p>Against UC Davis, the Gauchos will have a favorable matchup on defense considering the Aggies have a conference-low 13 goals scored in the entire year and have been shutout on six occasions on the year. Yet, the Gauchos will have to deal with UCD having home-field advantage.</p>\n<p>“There are no easy teams out there; it’s going to be tough. They have a system we like playing against, so some people are going to have to step up,” Stumpf said. “We’re still going to have to defend as well as we have in the first 18 games of the year.”</p>\n<p>On offense, UCSB is led by senior forward Allie Ariniello and junior midfielder Madison Beckley; each are tied with a team-high five goals. Ariniello uses her size to overwhelm her opponents and has been the clinical finisher on the team.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Beckley has been the spark off the bench, contributing with three assists as well. Together, they have put UCSB in third in league with 21 goals.</p>\n<p>Kick-off for Sunday’s game is scheduled at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 31, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52713\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/ucsb-travels-to-davis-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52713\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/ucsb-travels-to-davis-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/ucsb-travels-to-davis-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/ucsb-travels-to-davis-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/ucsb-travels-to-davis-with-postseason-on-the-line/","id":1588,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1587,1586,1585],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
