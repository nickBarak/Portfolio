Throughout his career, Oliver strove to create opportunities for minorities in UC, co-founding the UCLA Center for Study of Urban Poverty, and overseeing the creation of Chican@ studies, feminist studies and global studies Ph.D. programs during his tenure at UCSB. Before coming to UCSB, Oliver served as Vice-President of the Asset Building and Community Development Program at the Ford Foundation, where he developed a grant program to provide 35,000 low-wealth households with secure home mortgages and to change the way banks assess home mortgage applicants.</p>\n<p>Oliver has received multiple distinguished awards and fellowships in recognition of his work in higher education and philanthropy, including the Rockefeller Foundation Research Fellowship, National Science Foundation Research Initiation Planning Grant and more than $5 million in research support from NSF, Ford, Rockefeller, Russell Sage, Haynes, and the Social Science Research Council. During his time at UCLA, he was named the California Professor of the Year for his “extraordinary dedication to teaching and commitment to students.”</p>\n<p>Having earned his bachelor of arts at William Penn College in 1972, Oliver said he is both elated and honored to have been named president of an institution like Pitzer, which has “all of the characteristics of a great liberal arts college” that he admires.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always wanted to go back to my roots,” Oliver said. “The liberal arts was a transformative experience for me … it was the kind of place that encouraged my creativity, it was the kind of place that nurtured my intellectual curiosity and it gave me leadership opportunities to grow and develop.”</p>\n<p>Oliver said his appointment as the first African American president of an undergraduate Claremont college motivates him to create “ladders of opportunity” for those who come from backgrounds similar to his own.</p>\n<p>“In a lot of things I’ve done I’ve been the first. The first only means that you have to create the ladders of opportunity for other to follow. It’s not about you, it’s about what you can do for others,” Oliver said. “I see it as one of my responsibilities to create those ladders of opportunity so other students of color, other professors of color, other really disadvantaged folks can also have the same opportunities I’ve had.”</p>\n<p>Oliver said he was attracted to Pitzer because it reflects his own values, such as commitment to diversity, environmental sustainability and education geared toward social impact.</p>\n<p>“Those are all values that I’ve promoted in my life, into my work, and I think Pitzer is the kind of place I can go to and help them double down on some of those concerns they have — some of those issues that they’re grappling with,” Oliver said.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said Pitzer is fortunate to have Oliver, as he is a “seasoned administrator” who possesses unique leadership skills.</p>\n<p>“His vision and leadership have shaped the academic profile of social sciences at UC Santa Barbara, and he has been exemplary in advancing our commitment to diversity among students, faculty, and staff,” Yang said in an email. “Dean Oliver’s upcoming departure is a bittersweet moment for our university. We are immensely proud of his success, yet we regret losing a dear colleague and friend.”</p>\n<p>Donald Gould, a Pitzer trustee and head of the presidential search committee, said it took nearly a year to systematically narrow down the approximately 300 applicants, before the Pitzer board of trustees selected from among the final candidates. The board valued Oliver’s administrative and teaching background, as well as his time outside of the academic world, according to Gould.</p>\n<p>“The board has to select the individual that they feel in all respects, including temperament, experience, judgment, is the best person for the job, and I think that all of those things together led to our putting Melvin Oliver at the top of our list,” Gould said.</p>\n<p>Gould said the board took note of Oliver’s “heart for undergraduate education” and the impact of his own liberal arts educational experience as transformative.</p>\n<p>“Even within the large university settings at UCLA and UCSB he’s always been a champion of liberal arts education,” Gould said. “So certainly it will be a different environment than the large University of California environment, but we think that the things he’s learned in the UC system can only be beneficial to us.”</p>\n<p>On a broader stage, Oliver said he aims to promote the liberal arts educational environment as one that prepares students for the future.</p>\n<p>“We sometimes push for our students to be concerned with that first job out of college. We bemoan that the liberal arts isn’t allowing people to have those $100,000 a year jobs,” Oliver said. “But what we do create in the liberal arts are people who can be engaged citizens … We’re not about the first job, we’re about the last job. We’re about what you’re going to grow into.”</p>\n<p>Oliver said while he is leaving the UC system, he is hopeful both the California legislature and Governor Jerry Brown will continue to recognize the importance of investing in the UC.</p>\n<p>“The University of California, even with its problems, is still the most important mobility ladder for the state of California,” Oliver said. “The UC will continue to be the leader in doing that and I just hope that they can see the value in investing in UC. When we invest in UC, we invest in the future.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Thursday, February 4, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67890\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/dean-melvin-oliver-to-become-president-of-pitzer-college/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67890\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/dean-melvin-oliver-to-become-president-of-pitzer-college/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/dean-melvin-oliver-to-become-president-of-pitzer-college/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/dean-melvin-oliver-to-become-president-of-pitzer-college/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/dean-melvin-oliver-to-become-president-of-pitzer-college/","id":2567,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[2566,2565,2564],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro","biography":"Not available","articles":[2382,2386,2475,2567,2730,2735,2797,2823,2909,2948,2981,2990,3586,3605,3870,3895,3915,4407,4654,4682,4799],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Ex-Student Pleads Not Guilty in 2014 Campus Rape","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02162016-Daniel-Jiang-Chen-06.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02162016-Daniel-Jiang-Chen-06.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A former UC Santa Barbara student accused of raping a woman on campus in 2014 pleaded not guilty to two felony rape charges Tuesday and will continue to be held without bail.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A former UC Santa Barbara student accused of raping a woman on campus in 2014 pleaded not guilty to two felony rape charges Tuesday and will continue to be</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">held without bail.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniel J.

Rob Romero.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wearing an orange Santa Barbara County Jail shirt and blue pants, Chen stood behind glass in a separate room and communicated with his lawyer, Adam Pearlman, via a telephone on the wall. He did not speak except to acknowledge that he understood his right to a speedy trial would be postponed until his next trial date.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pearlman argued that photographers should not be allowed to take pictures of the proceedings Tuesday because of what he said was the “potential prejudice for potential jurors seeing Mr. Chen in a jail uniform,” but the judge ultimately allowed photographs by the press.</span></p>\n<p>When Ladinig was asked if he was considering a plea deal in exchange for the two other suspects, he said, “As of now, we’re just

booth at the Winter Career Fair on Thursday, claiming CBP participates in human rights abuses against those attempting to enter the United States.</p>\n<p>The protesters gathered at Corwin Pavilion, just outside the Career Fair in the Multicultural Center, chanting “Fuck your borders, fuck your walls!” and holding up signs in opposition to CBP and its policies.

Around them, protesters yelled, “¡La gente unida jamás será vencida!” meaning “The people united will never be defeated!”</p>\n<p>Juan Gonzalez, fourth-year economics and accounting major, said the protest was an affirmation of human rights.</p>\n<p>“It’s obviously a good thing because we’re protesting human rights violations,” Gonzalez said. “There’s a lot of people who die trying to cross the border, trying to have a better life, and these immigration officers make it harder than it’s supposed to be, so I think it’s good to bring attention to these issues.”</p>\n<p>About three hours into the event, protesters marched into the MCC and stood in front of the CBP booth, holding up signs and wearing duct tape over their mouths, before being directed by protest organizers to return outside and continue chanting.</p>\n<p>Cox said CBP was not upset by the protest and encouraged peaceful demonstration.</p>\n<p>“They have a belief that they believe in, and they don’t necessarily believe in the mission that we are tasked to do,” Cox said. “As long as it’s a peaceful demonstration, it doesn’t bother us one bit, and we encourage people to exercise their first amendment right.”</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the event, tensions flared as a number of students with dissenting opinions arrived outside the MCC to talk with some of the protest’s supporters.</p>\n<p>Jason Garshfield, fourth-year political science major, said he felt the protest was ineffective in creating a discussion about immigration laws.</p>\n<p>“They’re angry that CBP is having a booth at the Career Fair, and I think that’s somewhat silly because those agents aren’t here to deport anyone,” Garshfield said. “I don’t totally approve of our immigration laws—I think they need to be reformed and I think that that’s a legitimate debate—but when you get 100 people together chanting the same slogan, that’s not something that’s encouraging debate.”</p>\n<p>Rick Zierer, first-year political science major, said enforcement of American borders is necessary.</p>\n<p>“In a society, you have to enforce laws, and those laws exist, be they just or unjust,” Zierer said. “There are ways that we can look about maybe making legal immigration easier. We can look at more common-sense solutions than just allowing no enforcement of the border, which potentially could be very harmful to the migrants themselves.”</p>\n<p>Alejandra Melgoza, Associated Students senator and third-year Chican@ studies and sociology double major, helped organize the event and said the protest showcased the need for the university to provide more resources to the undocumented community.</p>\n<p>“I believe we need to support the undocumented community because they need more resources on our campus,” Melgoza said. “And as a research institution, we should able to provide the services that we need for our community.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67780\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-29/students-protest-u-s-customs-and-border-protection-booth-at-career-fair/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67780\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-29/students-protest-u-s-customs-and-border-protection-booth-at-career-fair/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-29/students-protest-u-s-customs-and-border-protection-booth-at-career-fair/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-29/students-protest-u-s-customs-and-border-protection-booth-at-career-fair/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-29/students-protest-u-s-customs-and-border-protection-booth-at-career-fair/","id":2566,"author":{"id":114,"name":"Hubert Zhang"},"related":[2565,2564,2563],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Academic Senate Meets to Discuss Campus Issues","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-01-31T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/UCSB-Academic-Senate.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/UCSB-Academic-Senate.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The bi-quarterly Academic Senate met Thursday night in the UCen State Street room to update the faculty on campus issues.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The bi-quarterly Academic Senate met Thursday night in the UCen State Street room to update the faculty on campus issues.</p>\n<p>The meeting included reports on happenings such as new professors and Fall 2016 application rates.</p>\n<p>UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang recognized the passing of UCSB faculty members, including Otis Madison, a professor in the Department of Black Studies, and said Madison’s time at UCSB was impactful.</p>\n<p>“He lectured on campus for almost 40 years and was very inspiring,” Yang said. “People remember him very well.”</p>\n<p>Yang also took the time to recognize the passing of important alumnus Jim Barber, who is responsible for the idea of the Gaucho Reunion, a sort of homecoming weekend that over 10,000 UCSB alumni attend annually.</p>\n<p>According to Yang, the application rates for incoming 2016 freshmen were the highest and most competitive to date. Yang called the freshman application pool the “most important item” of the meeting.</p>\n<p>Yang attributed lower past application rates to the events of May 23 in 2014, but said that the increase in this year’s applicants demonstrates that the school’s reputation is recovering.</p>\n<p>“This is something we have been focusing our efforts towards and represents a victory for us,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>Yang said the number of applicants increased 9.3 percent from last year, a remarkable rise compared to the rest of the UC campuses.</p>\n<p>“[This is] the highest increase in applicants — aside from Merced, which is still growing — among all UC campuses,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>There were a total of 77,090 applicants for Fall 2016, 42 percent of which had a high school GPA of 4.0 or higher.</p>\n<p>Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn spoke on a variety of initiatives, including the integration of a transfer student support center on campus that will be in the new library.</p>\n<p>Klawunn said she is proud of UCSB’s diversity.</p>\n<p>“One of the things that excited me most about coming to work at UCSB was the dedication the faculty puts forth to encourage full diversity of the student body,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>Academic Senate Chair Kum-Kum Bhavnani discussed Wednesday’s Associated Students Senate meeting, the UC Board of Regents proposal to increase off-campus housing funding and nonresident tuition costs, for which a bill is currently being drafted.</p>\n<p>Bhavnani said the Board of Regents has worked with UC campuses to complete projects.</p>\n<p>“Word on the street is, if the Regents can handle all the complications of UCLA’s structures, then it can handle us,” Bhavnani said.</p>\n<p>The Academic Senate will hold its next meeting in early March.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67812\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-31/academic-senate-meets-to-discuss-campus-issues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67812\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-31/academic-senate-meets-to-discuss-campus-issues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-31/academic-senate-meets-to-discuss-campus-issues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-31/academic-senate-meets-to-discuss-campus-issues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-31/academic-senate-meets-to-discuss-campus-issues/","id":2565,"author":{"id":116,"name":"Madison Hechler"},"related":[2564,2563,2562],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
