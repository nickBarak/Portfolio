Racioppi didn’t let another ball past her for the remainder of the tournament, which saw the Gauchos top Ohio, Vermont, Cal Poly, Penn State and Texas in succession.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, UCSB’s easiest wins were its last two. The Gauchos blew out the Nittany Lions 4-0 in the semifinal and hung a 3-0 shutout on the Longhorns in the tournament final.</p>\n<p>A dominant defense was the common thread between this year’s championship team and last year’s side.</p>\n<p>UCSB surrendered only one goal in the 2016 tournament, which saw the Gauchos defeat UNC in a 1-0 thriller for the title.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s club soccer success goes beyond just the last two seasons. No other team has more than three national titles in the last 11 years. The Gauchos have seven.</p>\n<p>“One of the traditions we like to talk about is our success on the field and what we bring to each game,” Head Coach Todd Heil said. “Back-to-back is great and seven is pretty impressive, but year in and year out we’ve just been very fortunate to have a great group of girls.”</p>\n<p>Such dominance is only possible through passion and commitment on the part of everyone involved in the club soccer program. That starts with the players, naturally.</p>\n<p>“With the club sports mentality, it’s a group of girls that just truly want to be there and want to play the game,” Heil said. “They’re there on their own behest; they’re not there on scholarship. They are what some might call the true student-athletes, and when it clicks and they just want to all be there together, that’s even more special.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the players contribute more to the program than just their on-field performance. They’re the front-line recruiters for the team as well, manning booths and getting the word out in order to bolster the roster each year.</p>\n<p>“A lot of [the recruitment] is on the returning player,” Heil said. “Basically, you’re [creating] the path. If it’s not social media, then you’re working a table at Spring Insight. You’re just trying to get the word out once students actually become students of UCSB.”<br>\nOnce the recruitment work has been done and the season has actually started, things don’t get any easier for the club players.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s soccer club team practices three times a week rather than six times like the Division I team, but it has to balance those practices against a full schedule of academics and extracurricular activities.</p>\n<p>“Our weeks are so busy that the weekends would be a great time to get school work done, but during fall these weekends are filled with games,” Club President Ann Marie Mansholt, a four-year player, said. “This just means that time management is crucial, and we somehow get it done, whether it’s studying on a plane or in the lobbies of our hotels.”<br>\nThe club season starts right alongside school in late September and wastes no time in getting going.</p>\n<p>“We get going the first week of school,” Heil said. “We have regionals the fourth week of school and nationals is basically right around that seventh week of school. That’s cramming in a lot. You’re playing about 15 soccer games pretty quickly.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79948\" style=\"width: 372px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2028394936\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79945\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79948\" data-attachment-id=\"79948\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/ucsb-womens-club-soccer-shines-in-back-to-back-fashion-win-7th-national-title-with-3-0-win-over-texas/wcsoccer_pic2-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?fit=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"WCSoccer_Pic2 (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-79948\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1-768x1024.jpg?resize=362%2C482\" alt=\"\" width=\"362\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=1122%2C1496&amp;ssl=1 1122w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=840%2C1120&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?w=1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79948\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Photo Courtesy of Jordan Burke</em></p></div>\n<p>It’s a lot to ask not only from the players but from the coaches as well. Heil is the boys’ soccer coach at Santa Barbara High School as well as a club soccer coach, but he manages to balance his responsibilities and keep the team running smoothly.</p>\n<p>“The continuous success starts with our coach, Todd Heil,” Mansholt said. “He has been the coach since the start of this club about 18 years ago. He has built this program from the bottom up and has given this program consistent leadership.”</p>\n<p>While the club team may not get as much academic and structural support from the university as the Division I team does, that doesn’t mean it is on its own. Both Heil and Mansholt made sure to credit the Recreational Sports program for its support of their team and all other club squads.</p>\n<p>As a senior, Mansholt is going out on top. It’s an emotional experience, but she’ll be leaving behind a program with a deep tradition of success and a bright future.</p>\n<p>“I believe this team can continue success into the future by keeping the close bonds we have formed and keeping true to our style of soccer,” she said. “Now that this younger group has a taste of winning back-to-back national championships, I believe they will keep working harder than ever to win another one and keep having a blast while doing so.”</p>\n<p>That ethos of success and hard work balanced with fun is what makes the UCSB women’s club soccer team, and all club sports, special.

In the case of Gaucho alumnus Mike Heid, class of 1995 graduate, his affinity for UCSB men’s soccer has formed a community between both current and incoming Gaucho sports fans and veterans that have been around for decades.</p>\n<p>Heid is the creator of <em>gauchosoccer.com</em>, a blog with ties to nearly any and all things related to UCSB men’s soccer.</p>\n<p>According to the website’s archives tab, information on the site dates back as early as Sept. 2016.</p>\n<p>Insight on current and former Gauchos that are now playing at either the MLS or international pro levels, the program’s 2018 recruiting class and even the formations and plays the team ran while on the field are all available on Heid’s site.</p>\n<p>Although intriguing, the website’s most striking piece of content is Heid’s self-titled “How I Procured My Own UCSB Soccer Jersey: A Case Study in Citizen Journalism.”</p>\n<p>With little to lose as an avid UCSB men’s soccer fan looking to further support his alum, Heid took his right to citizen journalism beyond the keyboard and into public records to satisfy his need for a conclusion.</p>\n<p>Despite being home to 20 Division-I sports programs, UCSB is not necessarily a sports powerhouse.</p>\n<p>With that said, the search for a team jersey in any sport is a likely afterthought for many, but not all.</p>\n<p>While browsing <em>ucsbgauchos.com</em>, one would likely come across the athletics department’s “UCSB shop” tab and would eventually find their way onto its Gauchos Shop.<br>\nCategorized under the site’s “men’s jersey” tab, the only available jerseys for purchase are for baseball and men’s basketball.</p>\n<p>Published on Nov. 4, Heid’s article chronicles his search to purchase a UCSB men’s soccer jersey, a seven-month process that began in April of this year.</p>\n<p>Trailblazing Heid’s investigation was a question about the availability of purchasing a men’s soccer jersey on the UCSB sub-Reddit a while back, influencing him to exhaust all of his possible resources in hopes of finding an answer.</p>\n<p>“For years, I’ve wanted to buy UCSB soccer jerseys. Every year I go to the Gaucho shop and jersey section, and every year it’s the same stuff. There was one year when they did sell the actual jersey, which I still have, but [nothing else since].”</p>\n<p>One of his first steps was reaching out to staff within the UCSB athletics department.</p>\n<p>His exchange of emails primarily took place with Richard Loza, director of Marketing, Branding and Sales and Bryan Cornet, the department’s assistant athletics director of Sales and External Relations.</p>\n<p>In an email sent to Cornet, Heid even offered to put up his own money for the UCSB athletics department to use in hopes of them buying the jerseys and putting them up for sale.</p>\n<p>He proposed the idea that if the jerseys didn’t bring in any revenue, he would accept the loss and not get his money back. If the jerseys were to sell, he would make his money back and the department would keep the profit.</p>\n<p>Due to university regulations, the school was unable to accept the offer. But it wasn’t this fact alone that prompted Heid to continue his investigation.</p>\n<p>Rather, it was the estimated costs to produce the jerseys that seemed most contradictory. With Nike as the university’s sponsor at the time, prior to changing to Adidas, Heid was informed that the athletics department ordered “custom” jerseys that cost around $180 a piece.</p>\n<p>For any sports fan, the only merchandise that likely hits that market price or higher is an authentic NBA Hardwood Classics jersey, a pair of retro Michael Jordan sneakers or some other form of ultra-vintage memorabilia.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the price just didn’t add up.</p>\n<p>As expected, the $180 price tag suggested definitely caught Heid off guard, considering his history as a consumer of both authentic and replica soccer jerseys.</p>\n<p>The price, paired with dwindling communication with the athletics department, led to Heid filing a public records request to verify the information he had been given about the production of the jerseys.</p>\n<p>His request was to receive information about the men’s soccer program’s purchases from the past three years, in addition to the contract UCSB Athletics had with Nike.</p>\n<p>Once his request was fulfilled and the invoices were delivered, the claim that the jerseys cost $180 was quickly disproven as UCSB was actually paying $30-40 for each jersey, which was a discounted cost nearly half the retail price.</p>\n<p>Considering UCSB’s switch from Nike to Adidas, Heid ended up filing another public records request regarding the team’s costs for jerseys by the new sponsor.</p>\n<p>From May 31 throughout August, Heid was left empty-handed with no records as he was told that there were no invoices or receipts for jerseys under the new partnership.</p>\n<p>“I made two separate requests. For my second request, I had to do about 10 follow-ups,” he said. “I don’t think Athletics was necessarily caught off guard that I was up to something and maybe verifying what they had told me. Maybe they were caught off guard with what I did with the info. But I also didn’t want the whole thing to turn adversarial. I was a little afraid that I would ostracize myself from the process.”</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until Aug. 29 when Heid received order confirmation documents for both the team’s home and away jerseys. But the documentation only went so far, as Heid ended up reaching out to Adidas and eventually was put in touch with a retail vendor.</p>\n<p>Communication with Adidas was the peak of Heid’s investigation. Similar to the Nike partnership, UCSB’s new deal with Adidas also consisted of jersey prices being within the $40 range and served as the deciding factor for him purchasing a wholesale amount of blue and white jerseys on Sept. 21.

The sophomore caught freshman keeper Ben roach going the wrong way in a one-on-one penalty kick goal; this was Aguirre’s fifth of the season.</p>\n<p>The first half played out much too familiarly for Santa Barbara. Set up in a 4-4-2 formation, the Gauchos failed to capitalize on the few scoring opportunities they created for themselves, sending in just one shot against the Highlanders. Their offense could not get a solid hold of the field, seldom making it into the 6-yard box, and rather losing possession almost immediately after moving the ball to the forward line.</p>\n<p>Forward Ignacio Tellechea, unfortunately, saw this plenty of times over the opening 45 minutes as he controlled long balls and attempted to carry them up the field, only to find his teammates lagging far beneath him, unable to pressure the defense any further.</p>\n<p>Several lapses in the backline during the first 45 also foreshadowed the looming loss. Santa Barbara’s defense consistently left too much space for their opponents to play through the middle and locate each other with ease. The Highlanders threatened the Gauchos with six shots by the end of the half, two of them calling for difficult saves from goalie Ben Roach.</p>\n<p>Aguirre asserted himself from the get-go, carrying out strong attacks on the opposing backline. In the 20th minute, the sophomore found a gap in the Gaucho defense and launched a dangerously low and powerful shot that was then saved by Roach.</p>\n<p>Fellow frontman Antonio Lakossou was responsible for the Highlanders’ next notable threat just five minutes later when his header off of UCR’s first corner kick fell just wide of the left post.</p>\n<p>Frustrated and eager to put a number on the board, the teams took a more physical approach to their gameplay; 14 fouls, 6 yellow cards, and 2 red cards later—again, in just the second half— the match bordered on chaotic.</p>\n<p>UCSB amped up their offense a bit, adding four more shots to their scorebook. The closest the Gauchos got to scoring came at the foot of Rodney Michael in the last five minutes of the game. Despite being double-teamed by the competitor’s backline, the sophomore stud blasted a shot straight into keeper Edwin Gutierrez’s chest.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara did not offer any more offensive threats after this. Having faced one another four times in the past two years, the bad blood finally revealed itself in a fight that broke out between players less than five minutes later in front of the Riverside bench.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos hardly have time to dwell on the loss, however. While it has a relatively secure spot in the Big West Tournament, Santa Barbara cannot afford to lose its upcoming games if it wants a chance at hosting the tournament matchups at Harder Stadium later on. The turnaround begins with UC Irvine on Saturday, Oct. 13 at 7 p.m. Irvine is currently undefeated and, more significantly, coming off a huge win against #25 UC Davis from this past Wednesday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84334\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/late-penalty-kick-solidifies-gauchos-loss-to-uc-riverside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84334\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/late-penalty-kick-solidifies-gauchos-loss-to-uc-riverside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/late-penalty-kick-solidifies-gauchos-loss-to-uc-riverside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/late-penalty-kick-solidifies-gauchos-loss-to-uc-riverside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/late-penalty-kick-solidifies-gauchos-loss-to-uc-riverside/","id":1362,"author":{"id":283,"name":"Annika Pearson"},"related":[1361,1360,1359],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks to Build Off First Big West Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2018-10-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017.09.15_StephenManga_WSoccer-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017.09.15_StephenManga_WSoccer-10-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's soccer team is on the road this weekend hoping to pick up two conference victories first at UC Irvine then at UC Riverside.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_79023\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017.09.15_StephenManga_WSoccer-10-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"543077897\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"84157\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79023\" data-attachment-id=\"79023\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/gauchos-remain-winless-in-conference-play-following-1-1-draw-against-csun/lynsee-voss-races-for-possession-of-the-ball-stephen-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017.09.15_StephenManga_WSoccer-10-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1366\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lynsee Voss races for possession of the ball.

\r\n</script> \n<p>This season, UCSB has earned a 3-2 record away from home — 5-2 if you count neutral site matches — but has struggled against UC Irvine in recent memory losing against its Big West foe the past two seasons including a tough 4-1 loss last year in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos want to earn a win at UC Irvine, something the program has not accomplished since the 2005 season, then they will need to rely on offensive star Shaelan Murrison.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s junior forward/midfielder is the Big West’s leading point-getter with 18 on the season thanks in part to seven goals and four assists, the former being a team-high mark as well.</p>\n<p>Murrison has struggled recently, however, tallying just one assist and no scores in the last four games including going 0-17 in that same time span. Still, the Gauchos know that if the game gets close they can trust her as she does have three game-winners this season.</p>\n<p>Additionally, UCSB will look to rely on juniors Mallory Hrmatko and Lynsee Voss.</p>\n<p>Hrmatko, a former Big West freshman of the year, leads the team in assists with five and always has the offense playing a high pace. She also is great on the defensive side of things as she did earn a Big West Defensive Player of the Week for the week of August 27th.</p>\n<p>Voss, a transfer from the University of San Diego a couple of seasons ago, recently earned her first Big West Offensive Player of the Week following her game-winning goal against UC Davis last season. She currently has two goals in her Gaucho career.</p>\n<p>In order to fully secure a win against UCI then UCSB will also need to shut down its top contributors.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Claire Grouwinkel has been the ‘Eaters top offensive player with five goals on the season. Four of her five scores have been tallied in just the last three matches.</p>\n<p>Winners of four of their last five, UC Irvine also managed a big win to kick off conference play last week defeating Hawai’i in double overtime thanks to a game-winning goal from Reema Bzeih. The goal, along with helping the team pitch a shutout, helped the sophomore earn Big West Defensive Player of the Week honors.</p>\n<p>Win or lose, however, UCSB will definitely need to be prepared for Sunday’s match against UC Riverside. Currently, the only undefeated team left in the conference, UCR has steamrolled its opponents outscoring them 15-2.</p>\n<p>Riverside’s two goals allowed is by far the best mark in the conference as UCSB’s 12 goals allowed is tied for second best. Its goals-against average (.194) is also the best in the entire country comprised of 333 D-I schools.</p>\n<p>This is thanks in part to Annie Bailey. The redshirt junior keeper has been tremendous in her nine starts allowing just the two aforementioned goals but also tallying 34 saves.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders offense has mostly run through senior midfielder Madeline Feist who has had a tremendous season currently leading the team in points (17), goals (7) and assists (3). Her seven goals are tied with UCSB’s Murrison for most in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Feist has scored in each of the last two contests, including a game-winner against the University of Denver a few weeks ago.</p>\n<p>This weekend will be very telling for UCSB. The Gauchos have missed the tournament the last two seasons despite a great start in non-conference play.</p>\n<p>Before the big win against UC Davis, Santa Barbara had lost three of its last four and looked like it was tail-spinning heading into league. This weekend will show whether they truly have corrected their issues or will expose them against the much stiffer competition they are slated to face.</p>\n<p>UCSB will take on UC Irvine at 7 p.m. on Friday, October 5 at Anteater Stadium.
