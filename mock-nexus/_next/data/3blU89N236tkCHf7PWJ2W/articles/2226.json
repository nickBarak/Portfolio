Senate meeting, Renteria and Elections Board member Davis Quan said they created this threshold by looking back at previous special election voting record turnouts.</p>\n<p>Renteria and Quan previously said if the election is unable to meet the threshold by the original Thursday deadline, they would extend the deadline by a week.</p>\n<p>If the threshold is still not met by Nov. 2, the position of External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) will be left vacant until the Spring Quarter 2019 Election.</p>\n<p>The position is currently vacant following the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualification</a> of EVPSA-elect Mayela Morales last spring.</p>\n<p>Currently, the only candidate on the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/madeline-loudon-is-sole-declared-candidate-for-evpsa-special-election/\">ballot</a> is third-year history of public policy major Madeline Loudon, the runner-up in last spring’s election.</p>\n<p>Due to the office’s vacancy over the summer, the Senate passed a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-07-01/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-to-split-evpsa-duties/\">resolution</a> in July to split the duties and funds of the office between the External Vice President for Local Affairs, the Student Advocate General, the A.S.

Food Bank experienced dramatic growth at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2018, which was a factor in the group’s decision to expand its service, according to A.S. Food Bank Student Coordinator Daniel Yi.</p>\n<p>“The past couple weeks we’ve been easily reaching 500 to 600 new [visitors] per day. That kind of figure is a record figure compared to last year,” Yi said. “That was the peak we were hitting last year. And the first few weeks of this quarter, we’re already at that peak.”</p>\n<p>The record increase in clients has been challenging for the Food Bank, according to Yi.</p>\n<p>“I have to find the balance between supplying enough food to all our clients but also work[ing] within the limitations of the actual space we have,” Yi said.</p>\n<p>“I think opening a new day and getting more supply pickups should help smooth things out and satisfy our clients’ needs.”</p>\n<p>The Food Bank was also able to hire more employees to make the expanded hours possible.</p>\n<p>“I currently have 11 active student staff members on my schedule to maintain the pantry and move all of the food –– a handful have been hired in the recent summer and spring quarters, and others have been around for longer,” he said.</p>\n<p>Yi said the location of the Food Bank has historically made it difficult for students to be aware of its existence and informed on its purpose.</p>\n<p>“We’re tucked away on the third floor of the UCen, so people might just not know about the food resources available to them at this campus.”</p>\n<p>Outreach by the Food Bank and its partners could be a factor in its recent growth, according to Yi.</p>\n<p>“I guess over the last year, our Food Bank committee and a lot of our partners have been doing a really good job of promoting the Food Bank and promoting our resources,” Yi said.</p>\n<p>Yi said the Food Bank has been using social media to market new developments and products.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been promoting a lot of the exciting items we’re receiving at the Food Bank, as well as special events with our partners. I think some of our developments, like our previous space expansion, new refrigerators and microwaves have also generated quite a bit of buzz for us.”</p>\n<p>The Food Bank is funded by a combination of grants and a lock-in student fee, according to Yi. Within student fees, undergraduate students pay five dollars and graduate students pay three dollars at the beginning of each quarter.</p>\n<p>“We have received grants from TGIF and Global Food Initiative in order to pay for our refrigerators and van,” Food Bank Coordinator Rodolfo Herrera said. “A.S. Finance and Business has also passed for other capital investments in our space.”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Food Bank supplies most of the food to the A.S. Food Bank, Herrera said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Food Bank’s status as a non-profit allows the organization to receive special prices for assorted dry goods, low prices such as six cents per pound of bread and free produce.</p>\n<p>The Food Bank was seeing roughly 5,000 pounds of food moving in and out before opening on Fridays. With the new hours, this has increased.</p>\n<p>“With Friday open, we are now picking up food five days a week, which should bring us up to around 7,500 to 8,000 pounds per week,” Yi said.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article has been updated to clarify that the A.S. Food Bank does not charge students for food, but receives their goods from the Santa Barbara County Food Bank at a discounted price, and to clarify the number of visitors they receive a day. The price of the bread has also been corrected. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

meeting. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Mello, a third-year sociology and art double major, is currently studying abroad in Spain. He was voted in with 19 yes votes, one no vote and two abstentions.</p>\n<p>He will have a proxy at Senate for the rest of Fall Quarter 2018.</p>\n<p>He ran with the Isla Vista Party (IVP) during the Spring Quarter 2018 Elections on a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2018/\">platform</a> of helping students with housing and food insecurity.</p>\n<p>Mello was the first off-campus senator runner-up, having earned 4.4 percent of the first choice votes, according to the A.S. Elections Board website.</p>\n<p>“Far too frequently we are seeing landlords unwilling to cooperate with students in our demands to have housing — in our demands to have our repairs done in manageable ways that we aren’t paying for,” Mello said to the <em>Nexus</em> during the 2018 Spring Quarter election.</p>\n<p>Shadpour, who ran with Campus United (CU), won the highest percentage of first choice votes with 8.54 percent.</p>\n<p>He transferred to the University of Southern California (USC) over the summer and resigned from his position as senator.</p>\n<p>“After months of deliberation and hard decisions I decided to transfer to the USC Marshall School of Business, where I am pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Business Administration,” he said.</p>\n<p>Shadpour said he is disappointed that he will not be serving as senator, but is “confident in the abilities of the [69th] senate” to do a great job.</p>\n<p>Mello could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>This article will be updated.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
