It’s basically a day for them to come to our school,” Hackett said. “We play with them, basically make their day and are with them.”</p>\n<p>The program, which celebrated its fifth anniversary last year, is free of cost and held at Santa Margarita Catholic High School in Rancho Santa Margarita, CA — the very school that Hackett attended. Designed for children ages five and up with special needs, the program allows for each of the kids to get the opportunity to develop their skills and self-esteem through soccer.</p>\n<p>Besides participating in soccer activities, the children spend plenty of time interacting with the volunteers in various other events organized, such as face painting, balloon art and giveaways.</p>\n<p>The matter hits close to home for Hackett, who was inspired to volunteer after hearing the story of one of her best friend’s cousins being diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. That account encouraged Hackett to participate in TOPSoccer, a decision that has left just as big of a mark on her as it does on the children she helps. Although the program runs for only one day, it still leaves Hackett with a profound sense of self every year.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, it feels really awesome because you’re doing something for someone else and having that feeling — there are no words to describe it really,” Hackett said. “I’m very thankful for everything and my health and being a part of making them happy.”</p>\n<p>Despite her endeavors outside of the soccer field, Hackett is quick to remind the crowd of how good of a player she is when she does step onto the grass.</p>\n<p>In the first games of the season, Hackett has complemented the defense of the Gauchos and earned herself considerable playing time for a freshman. In nine games played so far, she has started four of them and proven to be a valuable asset to an already strong defense that features four seniors in the backline. In fact, Hackett was a part of four of UCSB’s shutout wins when it went on a five-game winning streak earlier in the year.</p>\n<p>“We brought her in to play center back,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “We kind of expect Kailey, once [the starters] graduate, to really kind of step in and be that starter that’s going to play an awful lot of minutes at the center back spot.”</p>\n<p>Accustomed to the big stage in high school where she led her team to a CIF championship, the college game brings with it some challenges and a learning curve Hackett still has to adjust to. Just like any other freshman playing for a different team, her first instances wearing the UCSB uniform brought an array of emotions to her, considering how far she has come and what she has given in the past.</p>\n<p>“It was nerve-racking and exciting at the same time because I worked really hard to get this far,” Hackett said. “It feels rewarding because I worked really hard to get to where I am right now.”</p>\n<p>When she is not tackling the ball away from defenders, Hackett is busy tackling the books. Her soccer aspirations fall in line with her academics and just like any student athlete, she still juggles time between the gym and the classroom.</p>\n<p>“It’s pretty stressful because of how much homework we have but I think it’s really awesome at the same time because you’re involved with so much stuff,” said Hackett.</p>\n<p>When the season ends, Hackett plans on returning to her hometown of Coto de Caza where she will join TOPSoccer once again for the winter at her high school. Despite all the shots she has taken while playing, it was the shot Hackett took off the pitch that has stayed with her the most, and which she encourages everyone to take.</p>\n<p>“No matter what, I think people should just go out there and give it a shot and put those kids and those people before you,” Hackett said.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next match is scheduled for Thursday at 10 p.m. against the University of Hawaii.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 9th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52401\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/making-a-difference-on-and-off-the-field/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52401\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/making-a-difference-on-and-off-the-field/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/making-a-difference-on-and-off-the-field/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/making-a-difference-on-and-off-the-field/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/making-a-difference-on-and-off-the-field/","id":1602,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1601,1600,1599],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Opens Big West With Two Shutouts","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MSoccer-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MSoccer-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeats Fullerton, Riverside at home.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With conference play opening up this weekend, the UCSB men’s soccer team announced to the rest of the league that they are ready to retake their claim as top dogs in the Big West.

Senior forward Achille Campion scored a goal 37 seconds into the game, setting the tone for the Gauchos early on. Campion’s goal was a team-high fourth on the season off a through ball from senior midfielder Goffin Boyoko, while senior defender Daniel Welsh also received an assist on the play.</p>\n<p>After Campion gave UCSB the advantage, the game developed into a physical match as nine yellow cards were issued during the night, with players from both teams not backing down. Play throughout the game was extremely chippy, especially during the second half.</p>\n<p>“To me, it starts and ends that there’s a responsibility for the man with the whistle. The reality is [the referee] let a lot go,” Vom Steeg said. “I thought we were tough enough, strong enough. We didn’t lose our composure, we didn’t freak out. I wasn’t joking when I said I was happy that we won the game, we had no injuries and we didn’t take a red card.”</p>\n<p>Playing with a 1-0 lead, the Gauchos received an insurance goal from freshman forward Ismaila Jome in the 82nd minute to cement the result as a UCSB victory. Jome’s shot from beyond the box was the first goal of his career.</p>\n<p>“I feel like [the offense is] progressing pretty well,” Jome said. “I’m new to the team, [freshman midfielder Drew Murphy] is new to the team and we have a couple more freshmen playing, so we’re just getting used to each other and playing up top with [Campion and Boyoko].”</p>\n<p>Defensively, UCSB was led by freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely who recorded five saves and posted his third consecutive shutout.</p>\n<p>“Our defense has finally found itself. They’re competing for balls, they’re competing for everything and they’re not leaving loose balls,” Vom Steeg said. “Josh is making the one or two plays that he has to make. The bottom line is we always thought our defense was going to be good this year; it just takes us a while. These are two games that we had to have this weekend and nothing’s ever easy.”</p>\n<p>While Sunday’s game certainly displayed the Gauchos’ superiority, UCSB was even more dominant on Friday night against Fullerton.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos received goals from three seniors not usually known for putting the ball in the back of the net in midfielder Fifi Baiden and defenders Peter Schmetz and Matt Glodack. Santa Barbara controlled the game, owning an 18-11 advantage in shots and a 7-4 edge in shots on goal.</p>\n<p>Campion and Jome each recorded an assist on the night, while Murphy added two for the Gauchos. Jome led the team in assists with five on the season.</p>\n<p>“I think we are clicking, we’re getting our team chemistry right now,” Baiden said. “At the beginning of every season, we have a lot of freshman on the team and people get injured, so it’s hard to find that team rhythm. But now everything is great, people are getting back from injury and we’re getting an understanding of how everyone plays.”</p>\n<p>McNeely was solid once again between the posts, making four saves on the night for the Gauchos. Thanks in large part to McNeely, UCSB has recorded shutouts in three consecutive matches for the first time since 2010 and sits atop the Big West North division standings.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely confidence when you don’t get scored on, that feels great because that means we can work going forward,” Campion said. “I think everyone did a good job and I’m proud of my teammates.”</p>\n<p>While defense was certainly a key to the victory, the offense found a groove, scoring three goals, and tied for a season-high with two other occasions in the year.</p>\n<p>“It was very important for our team confidence and what we’re trying to do in terms of winning the Big West tournament or winning a Big West championship,” Baiden said. “It’s good for us, it sets the tone for the next game and we’re going to be fired up for the next game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next travels to Cal State Northridge for a 7 p.m. match on Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 7, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52342\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-opens-big-west-with-two-shutouts/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52342\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-opens-big-west-with-two-shutouts/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-opens-big-west-with-two-shutouts/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-opens-big-west-with-two-shutouts/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-opens-big-west-with-two-shutouts/","id":1601,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1600,1599,1598],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Splits Pair of Weekend Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_093012-7.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_093012-7.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeats Irvine but falls to Long Beach.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With every victory there is always room for improvement.

Despite defeating UC Irvine 1-0 on Friday in its conference opener, the Gauchos suffered a disappointing loss to Long Beach State on Sunday.</p>\n<p>“The simple truth is we got beat by a better team. [Long Beach was] a little more technical, they were a little more athletic and we started off flat,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “We got beat by a better team. The good news is on the weekend, we’re 1-1.”</p>\n<p>After this past weekend, the Gauchos’ record stands at 7-5-1 overall and 1-1 in the Big West conference.

CSULB was not finished for the half and scored again eight minutes later when junior midfielder Taylor Nelson shot from distance into the corner of the goal to put the 49ers up by two heading into the second half.</p>\n<p>“Momentum is a really hard thing to turn around,” Stumpf said. “We were really chasing the game for the first 20, 30 minutes.”</p>\n<p>With adjustments made coming into the second half, UCSB was nearly able to even the game but was still unable to establish any rhythm offensively. Long Beach’s early momentum was enough to carry them past the Gauchos for a 2-1 win. After a shutout win on Friday, the Gaucho defense was not on par with Friday’s performance.</p>\n<p>“It’s a Sunday game, it’s hot in the afternoon and [the defense] played a lot of minutes on Friday night,” sophomore forward Angelisa Cortez said. “They worked hard, the best they can do … They played to the maximum of their ability.”</p>\n<p>Despite getting behind in the first half against Long Beach, Friday’s match against UC Irvine brought better results for the Gauchos. The two teams were in a defensive stalemate for the first half until UCSB broke through late with a goal in the 44th minute. Junior midfielder Madison Beckley headed in a cross for her team-high fifth goal of the season.</p>\n<p>UCI entered the second half with more inspired play and became aggressors on the offensive side of the pitch. Being limited to only three shots in the first 45 minutes of the game, the Anteaters had 10 shots in the second half. However, the solid Gaucho defense remained on point and kept UCI from getting off a serious threat on goal.</p>\n<p>In the final minutes of the game, the Gauchos began to slow down, causing Irvine to take advantage of the worn-out defensive. UCSB was able to survive the late scare by the Anteaters to hang on to the 1-0 win.</p>\n<p>“I think we only won two conference games all last year and I kind of put Irvine at the top of the pile in the teams in the Big West, so to get a result off them on a Friday night at home is great,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>It was UCSB’s sixth shutout win in its last eight games before losing on Sunday. Sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter continued her stellar play between the nets, coming up huge for five saves to preserve Friday’s shutout.</p>\n<p>UCSB will now travel to Hawaii to face the Warriors on Thursday, followed by another road game against Cal State Northridge on Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 7, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52340\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52340\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches/","id":1600,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1599,1598,1597],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Split Pair of Weekend Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/M_Soccer_Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/M_Soccer_Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Playing its first two games at home since the beginning of classes, the UCSB men’s soccer team split a pair of matches over the weekend.

Sophomore defender Marshall Cazares and freshman forward Ismaila Jome each received assists on the play, Jome’s team leading fourth this season.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Achille Campion led UCSB with three shots on goal while Jome contributed two. Jome is quickly becoming a dangerous weapon for the Gauchos and is one of five freshmen starting for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“[Jome] just gets on everything. The thing about him is he competes, he’s fearless,” Vom Steeg said. “You look at a player like that and there’s no reason he shouldn’t potentially be the freshman of the year in the conference.”</p>\n<p>Freshman midfielder Paul Ehmann received a red card in the 89th minute, forcing the Gauchos to play a man down for the remaining minute plus. Luckily, a Lions’ comeback never materialized. Freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely posted his second career shutout Sunday.</p>\n<p>“We had 17 shots and we were dangerous. It was the first time we scored where we actually passed four times next to each other,” Vom Steeg said. “I thought all that was promising. At the end of the day we got the result we needed tonight. It was an important win going into league.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s highly anticipated match against Stanford (5-1-1) proved to be entertaining for the 7,750 fans in attendance. Tied at one apiece and in overtime, Stanford used the second goal of the day from freshman forward Jordan Morris in the 95th minute to clinch the victory.</p>\n<p>Morris scored in the 31st minute to give Stanford a 1-0 lead before senior defender Peter Schmetz scored his first goal of the season in the 53rd minute to tie the game and ultimately send it to overtime. Ehmann and sophomore forward Charlie Miller were credited with assists on the goal by Schmetz.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s offense struggled to convert opportunities into goals, a clear theme thus far in the season. The Gauchos outshot Stanford 12-8 with a 6-4 advantage in shots on goal.</p>\n<p>“I was a little bit frustrated after the Stanford game because I had a chance after four minutes and I missed it,” Boyoko said. “We have the chances, we just need to shoot on target and make the keeper make the save.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos open conference play on Friday when they host Cal State Fullerton. Kickoff is scheduled for 7:30 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of September 30, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52223\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/gauchos-split-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52223\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/gauchos-split-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/gauchos-split-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/gauchos-split-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/gauchos-split-pair-of-weekend-matches/","id":1599,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1598,1597,1596],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
