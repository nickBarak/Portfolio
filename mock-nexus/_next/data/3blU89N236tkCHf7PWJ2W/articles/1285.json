Both the Gauchos and the Titans were vying for a place in the national rankings coming into this matchup, with UCSB debuting on the Top Drawer Soccer rankings at No. 19 while Fullerton clinged to a No. 22 spot on that list and a No. 24 spot in the United Soccer Coaches poll.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What looked to be a colossal matchup between two of the top teams in the conference turned into a bloodbath pretty quickly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos dominated from the opening kick, passing circles around the Titan defense. They strung together a quick combination in the midfield just eight minutes in that culminated with a Noah Billingsley cross to forward Rodney Michael on the right side of the box. Michael sent in a low driven pass to Will Baynham who used his 6’3” frame to hold off a defender and place the ball in the lower left corner for a goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just four minutes later, Billingsley stole the ball deep in Titan territory and set a streaking Thibault Candia up with a through ball in the box. Candia stepped up and rocketed the ball past the CSUF goalkeeper to double the Gaucho lead at the 12 minute mark.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was one of the most complete halves that UCSB has put together this season, and a large part of the team’s heightened level of play can be attributed to the return of senior defender Billingsley. In the first 30 minutes of the match he had multiple key stops on the defensive end, and he got his second assist of the game in the 28th minute when Michael corralled his pass in the box and ricocheted a shot into the back of the net.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Billingsley and junior defender Hunter Ashworth are now back after qualifying for the Tokyo Olympics with the New Zealand U-23 team, and have filled the extremely important gap in the defense left by Faouzi Taieb’s devastating knee injury in the game against Stanford.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’ve been at the helm of this Gaucho defense that now has a Big West leading six shutouts under its belt, and only gave up two shots on goal in the first half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The halftime break cooled UCSB off, and the Titans came out looking to gain some momentum and cut into the 3-0 deficit. Junior defender Clayton Torr put an early shot on goal that was saved by UCSB goalie Ben Roach in the 46th minute, but that ended up being the first of only two shots on goal for the rest of the period for CSUF.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB started to gain momentum as the half wore on, and in the 59th minute Baynham stole an attempted clearance in the Fullerton third of the field and sent in a pass to the box that took a slight touch from Billingsley before falling at the feet of forward Finn Ballard McBride. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ballard McBride took a touch and calmly curled the ball around the goalkeeper for his sixth goal in what has been an incredible freshman campaign. The Australian already has two Big West Freshman of the Week awards to go along with one Big West Offensive Player of the Week award, and is fourth in the conference in goals scored. He’s a leading candidate for Freshman of the Year so far and he put the Gauchos up 4-0 around 15 minutes into the second half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos notched their fifth and final goal in the 66th minute when Ashworth headed home a Candia corner kick, putting an end to an incredible scoring onslaught.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking ahead, UCSB should be moving into the official NCAA Top 25, which is based off of the United Soccer Coaches Poll. If the Gauchos continue to mow through the conference with only one or two more losses they are in prime position to qualify for the NCAA Tournament outright, a feat the team hasn’t achieved since 2015. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This squad has hit its stride at the perfect time. If they can stay perfect in this extremely talented Big West Conference there’s no telling what the ceiling is for the Gauchos.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Consequently, USF’s record fell to 4-5 on the season.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For what seems like the first time this season, the Gauchos demonstrated poise and consistency, allowing them to maintain control over each of their opponents. Over the course of the two matches, Santa Barbara did not let one singles match drop. Against Pacific, five out of six of the Gauchos even secured their matches in just solid two-set victories. Santa Barbara continued its one-man dominance against the Dons, sweeping on all six courts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Head Coach Marty Davis made a hopeful change to his lineup, placing sophomore Wilhelm Saiga on the No. 5 court over teammates Luka Vukmanovic and Alex Soto. Saiga closed out the day with a competitive two-set match. He pulled out a 7-5 tiebreaker win to secure the first set and then successfully stomped out his opponent with a 6-4 victory in the second. The next day, Saiga clinched the win for SB against USF with a three-set 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior Joseph Rotheram set the pace for the Gauchos’ uninterrupted winning streak after he took down Pacific’s Nathan Hampton 6-0, 6-2 in the No. 4 spot. A steady presence on court four, Rotheram came out of the weekend going 2-0 on his own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Victor Krustev took his match to a tiebreaker set after losing the first 2-6, coming out on top with an overall 2-6, 6-1, 2-0 triumph. The junior came out on top after battling his USF competitor to a tie-breaking point in the second set. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps even more crucially, Santa Barbara’s doubles partners finally showed up to play. Versus Pacific, an initial win from senior-sophomore pairing Joseph Guillin and Alejandro Vedri and senior-freshman duo Alex Soto and Joshua Williams secured the doubles point first thing of the day. Consequently, Krustev and Rotheram’s match was left unfinished, though they held the advantage 5-2 at the call. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vedri and Guillin, back on court two, were responsible for the lone doubles win in Sunday’s match. Soto and Williams attempted to follow it up, but a penalty point for unsportsmanlike conduct put a nail in their coffin, finishing with a 6-3 score.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now entering the last leg of their non-conference matches, the Gauchos finally seem to be finding their way. Santa Barbara now looks ahead to their next match on Sunday, where they will face San Diego State. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

The score held up for a decent stretch until Aggie Junior Ana Williams knocked in the game-tying score in the 36th minute, her second goal of the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first half ended with the score tied and the second half continued with much of the same, as both teams got some decent looks at the goal but could not convert. But even as both teams got opportunities on offense, the Gauchos were the ones who had the edge as their 19 shot attempts nearly doubled the Aggies’ 10 attempts. This disparity in shot opportunities is what ended up giving the Gauchos the edge by the end, as Murison knocked down her second goal of the afternoon in the 85th minute and clinched the win for Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Murison continues to make her case for Big West Player of the Year by scoring her ninth and tenth goals of the season on a day when she attempted a game-high nine shots and put six of them on frame. Her 10 goals place her first in the Big West in that category, and she also leads the conference in shots attempted, with 62. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides Murison, two other Gauchos attempted multiple shots, as junior Isabella Viana got four shots off, and senior Katherine Sheehy attempted three shots, two of them being on goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior Hanna DeWeese held down the goal for another stellar performance, only allowing one goal in a game where she was under attack a fair amount. DeWeese had four saves on five shots on goal, and she continues to lead the Big West in goals allowed per game, with a .87 average. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the Aggies, this loss proved to be another heartbreaker in a string of five straight difficult losses for their squad. Of their last five defeats, four of them have been lost by a margin of just one goal, and they are struggling to get over that hump. They have proved to be a capable team in the past when they won five of their first eight matchups, but since then bad luck and some costly mistakes have sent them into a downward spiral. UC Davis has many capable weapons on offense as six Aggies have scored multiple goals on the season, but none of them have recorded more than three goals. The emergence of a go-to player on offense might be what gets Davis back on track as we move further into conference play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Thursday’s win, the UCSB joins Hawai’i and Cal State Fullerton as the only remaining unbeaten teams in the Big West. The Gauchos will now get a week off before they hit the road again this Thursday, Oct. 17, to take on the 8-4-3 (2-1) Cal State Northridge Matadors, who have built some momentum of their own by winning their last two games. Next Thursday’s game will kick off in Northridge at 7:00 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90416\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-13/ucsb-womens-soccer-defeats-uc-davis-2-1-for-third-consecutive-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90416\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-13/ucsb-womens-soccer-defeats-uc-davis-2-1-for-third-consecutive-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-13/ucsb-womens-soccer-defeats-uc-davis-2-1-for-third-consecutive-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-13/ucsb-womens-soccer-defeats-uc-davis-2-1-for-third-consecutive-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-13/ucsb-womens-soccer-defeats-uc-davis-2-1-for-third-consecutive-win/","id":1283,"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone"},"related":[1282,1281,1280],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Under The Influence: Alcohol and Drugs","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“He wasn’t a problem kid,” John Piacentini, whose son Nick passed away last year, said.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>“He wasn’t a problem kid,” John Piacentini, whose son Nick passed away last year, said. “His death was a very tragic accident.

In Winter Quarter, two students overdosed on heroin and nearly died.</p>\n<p>“I’ve never seen a year like that,” I.V. Foot Patrol Lt. Olmstead said of the drug and alcohol related deaths in the 2008-09 school year. “They were normal, everyday, good people who made a mistake.”</p>\n<p>Last spring, 1,000 UCSB students took a survey responding to questions about using intoxicants. According to the study, 79.4 percent had consumed alcohol in the past month. 13.5 percent had tried cocaine, 20.6 percent had used prescription drugs that they were not prescribed and 2.5 percent had tried opiates.</p>\n<p>“A lot of students are happy with the party scene,” Olmstead said. “Students need to recognize that there is a problem.”</p>\n<p><strong>“You think it’s never going to happen to you.”</strong></p>\n<p>Just a week from graduating in 2009, Noah Krom headed downtown to celebrate with friends.

However, the potentiality is way up there,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to clinical manager of the UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program Jackie Kurta, one of the most popular prescription drugs in the student community is Xanax, an anti-anxiety medication and muscle relaxant.</p>\n<p>“There’s easier access all around to prescriptions,” Kurta noted. “[When there is an] increase of supply, there is a decrease of cost.”</p>\n<p>Kurta said many students who use prescription medication recreationally are often dealing with underlying mental health issues such as stress, anxiety or depression.</p>\n<p>“These are pain medications,” she said. “These medications temporarily relieve that pain and it’s another form of that pleasure response that people are looking for. But they’re not aware of the long-term risks.”</p>\n<p><strong>“It was a fluke thing and a perfect storm.”</strong></p>\n<p>While there has been a visible increase in the use of prescription medications on campus, Kurta noted that one of the most dangerous trends has been a rise in opiate use. The most common opiates abused in the student community are Vicodin and OxyContin.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Chad Andrew Briner was found dead on Sabado Tarde Road in front of the recliner where he had fallen asleep earlier in the night in September 2008.<br>\nAccording to investigative coroner’s reports, Chad became addicted to prescription medication after taking pills for surgery and an intestinal disease.</p>\n<p><span><div id=\"attachment_22593\" style=\"width: 202px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/chadbriner2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"182942790\" data-slb-group=\"22586\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-22593\" data-attachment-id=\"22593\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/influence-alcohol-drugs-feature/chadbriner2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/chadbriner2.jpg?fit=462%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"462,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"DSC-S700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1221052090\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"5.8\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"chadbriner2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/chadbriner2.jpg?fit=193%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/chadbriner2.jpg?fit=462%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/chadbriner2-192x250.jpg?resize=192%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"chadbriner2\" width=\"192\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-22593\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-22593\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chad Andrew Briner</p></div></span>Chad’s father, Rob Briner, said that his son was “on over<br>\n12 different prescribed medications” for a period of time, although most were not narcotic related.</p>\n<p>“I think he found temporary refuge and happiness by way<br>\nof self medicating,” Briner said. “It was a fluke thing and a perfect storm. There were signs and symptoms leading up<br>\nto his demise. However, the people around him and available to him didn’t see it.”</p>\n<p>According to the toxicology report, two OxyContin pills were found in Chad’s small intestine and traces of cocaine were found in his blood. The immediate cause of death is listed as “Oxycodone Intoxication.”</p>\n<p>Chad was 21 years old.</p>\n<p>In addition to prescription opiate abuse, Director of Student Health Dr. Elizabeth Downing said there has also been an increase in students experimenting with heroin.</p>\n<p>“Black tar heroin is very readily available on the street and is currently quite inexpensive and very potent; many students seem to be ignorant of the very dangerous risks associated with heroin or other narcotic use due to a very narrow margin of safety,” Downing said in an e-mail.</p>\n<p>Janet O’Neill, Cottage Health System’s director of public affairs, said the hospital staff has also seen a substantial increase in serious heroin abuse.</p>\n<p>“What we’re seeing at Goleta Valley … is an increase in heroin,” O’Neill said. “It’s been noticeable.”</p>\n<p>Two UCSB students, Nick Piacentini and Walker Jameson Price, passed away in the last two years after experimenting with heroin and other intoxicants. Price, a second-year global studies major, was found dead in his Summerland home in October 2008 after using heroin in combination with a number of prescription medications. The coroner’s report classified his death as accidental multiple drug ingestion.  He was 19 years old.</p>\n<p><span><div id=\"attachment_22598\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/WalkerJamesonPRice.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1806070871\" data-slb-group=\"22586\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-22598\" data-attachment-id=\"22598\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/influence-alcohol-drugs-feature/walkerjamesonprice/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/WalkerJamesonPRice.jpg?fit=651%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"651,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XSi\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1218017751\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"135\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"WalkerJamesonPRice\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/WalkerJamesonPRice.jpg?fit=250%2C230&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/WalkerJamesonPRice.jpg?fit=651%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/WalkerJamesonPRice-250x230.jpg?resize=250%2C230\" alt=\"\" title=\"WalkerJamesonPRice\" width=\"250\" height=\"230\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-22598\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/WalkerJamesonPRice.jpg?resize=250%2C230&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/WalkerJamesonPRice.jpg?w=651&amp;ssl=1 651w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-22598\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Walker Jameson Price</p></div></span>Kaminsky noted that there are a few factors that make heroin and other opiates more addictive than most drugs — one of which is purely biological.</p>\n<p>“[Opiate receptors are] a natural occurrence in the body. Opiate receptors are in the brain as part of the pleasure center,” he said.</p>\n<p>In addition to being highly addictive, heroin is easy to overdose on due to the varying potency of different batches, especially when combined with other drugs.</p>\n<p><br>\n<strong>What’s next?</strong></p>\n<p>According to Associate Dean of Students Deborah Fleming, the university took action after last year’s deaths in part by establishing the “Just Call” campaign, which encourages students to call for help if their friends show signs of distress while partying.</p>\n<p>The C.A.S.E. Program has also adapted some of its material to fit changing needs and the Drug and Alcohol program has established more offices in Embarcadero Hall. The I.V. Foot Patrol installed a prescription drug “drop-off” box where expired or unused drugs can be dropped off anonymously and disposed of environmentally.</p>\n<p>Despite community efforts to prevent future tragedies, Rob Briner said that much more needs to be done.</p>\n<p>“What’s happening in I.V. is unacceptable and until we all stand tall … Nothing substantial will happen,” he said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Health Educator Michael Takahara said that a contributing factor to the extreme party culture in I.V. is the social norms theory — the perception that “everyone else is doing it.”</p>\n<p>The National Collegiate Health Assessment showed a huge discrepancy between the number of UCSB students who actually engage in habitual drug experimentation and the perceptions of student use.</p>\n<p>“[When] perceptions are wrong and exaggerated, people will be influenced by their false perceptions, not facts. Therefore, one strategy is to clear up misperceptions with actual use so people will not be falsely influenced,” Takahara said.</p>\n<p>Sara’s friend Taylor Suiter, who now serves as a Students Teaching Alcohol and Drug Responsibility intern, said friends also need to take responsibility for each other.</p>\n<p>“If I have a friend who appears to be in distress, I have no problem picking up the phone,” Suiter said. “I’d rather have a friend in trouble than a friend who’s dead.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Fleming expressed a need for more property owners and local alcohol retailers to interact with students responsibly.</p>\n<p>“Who’s benefiting from all of this partying and alcohol use? There’s a whole industry downtown,” she said. “Property owners on Del Playa get very high rent. There are lots of people in one unit and there’s a wink-wink nod-nod about partying in the apartment about damages. Shouldn’t property owners take more responsibility for what goes on on their properties?”</p>\n<p>Beth Krom, Noah’s mother, said a strong effort on all fronts is the only real way to prevent future fatalities in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Only through the concerted efforts of all stakeholders — the university, public policy leaders, public safety and those who profit by the student population such as property owners and those who run the bars and restaurants students patronize — can a positive change in the UCSB/Isla Vista culture be advanced,” she said in an e-mail. </p>\n<p>John Piacentini said he hopes students learn from last year’s tragedies.</p>\n<p>“You really need to be careful and you really need to know your limits and you really need to be aware of the people around you,” he said. “There’s nothing that you can imagine like losing a son or a brother or a best friend.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-22586\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/influence-alcohol-drugs-feature/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-22586\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/influence-alcohol-drugs-feature/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/influence-alcohol-drugs-feature/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/influence-alcohol-drugs-feature/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-10/influence-alcohol-drugs-feature/","id":1284,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[1283,1282,1281],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
