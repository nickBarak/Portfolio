Student Affairs contributed $100,000, and the university allocated the remaining $800,000 through the deferred maintenance program.</p>\n<p>University officials originally told students to evacuate El Centro within 45 days, saying the building would either be demolished or improved within that time period. The alarming notice provoked outcry from student groups that use the historical space.</p>\n<p>The university intended to complete the project over the summer, but plumbing complications and changes with university officials overseeing the project slowed the project’s process, said Lorena Alvarez, a fourth-year English major and member of the El Centro Committee.</p>\n<p>“I guess they didn’t realize how many structural issues the building had,” Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>El Centro serves as a gathering space for various cultural organizations, including El Congreso, M.U.J.E.R. de UCSB, Students for Justice in Palestine and conglomerate Mesa Directiva.</p>\n<p>The building is located in two combined industrial trailers and was initially designed to last 10 years, according to campus architects. The building has long outlasted its lifespan, and cultural groups that have occupied the space since the 1970s demand a permanent foundation for its walls.</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the building repairs were slow at the start of the summer due to plumbing complications and when a project manager went on vacation, but progress sped up when Alvarez returned to UCSB in August.</p>\n<p>“Over the summer, you would have seen nothing being done to El Centro, and when I came back in August, you started seeing weekly changes,” she said.</p>\n<p>Former campus architect Marc Fisher, who was one of the lead contributors to the project, left UCSB over the summer to take a job at UC Berkeley.</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the El Centro Committee worked with Fisher until he left and has since communicated with Renee Bahl, associate vice chancellor for Design, Facilities and Safety Services, about the repairs.</p>\n<p>The El Centro Committee was designed to monitor the building repairs and keep an open line of communication between students and administrators. The group meets weekly to discuss the building’s progress.</p>\n<p>“We aren’t architects,” Alvarez said. “We want to make sure we understand what’s happening as students.”</p>\n<p>After a seismic stabilization project that began in February, the university added 12 concrete pillars around the north and east sides of the building.</p>\n<p>These structures made the building more durable and resilient to earthquakes, campus architect Ed Schmittgen told the <em>Nexus</em> in April, and the university opted to repair the building instead of demolish it.</p>\n<p>Some student organizations have been able to use various parts of the building throughout the reconstruction.</p>\n<p>In October, El Congreso was permitted to use the second floor of the building once again, after being unable to use it for the first few weeks of Fall Quarter, Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>Two rooms were also available for students to use as study spaces, and two full time Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) counselors and cultural mentors began using the space to hold office hours.</p>\n<p>The El Centro Committee also received $9,000 from the Associated Students Senate in October to purchase a security system for the building.</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the system will have card readers and make it easier for students to access the building more frequently, even when other student groups are not holding office hours or using the building.</p>\n<p>“We had an issue with students being not being able to get into El Centro because it was locked,” Alvarez said. “Getting the card reader … would be a safer way for them to navigate through the building and get access to the building.”</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the university has been transparent about its work on the building’s progress.</p>\n<p>“I’m really thankful that they’re allowing us to be a part of these conversations and ask for things when we need clarifications,” Alvarez said. “They’ve been really helpful in that sense.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Nov. 30 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Yang, Vice Chancellor Marc Fisher and UCSB Bookstore director Mark Beisecker to discuss pulling Jansport products from the Bookstore. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The UCSB chapter of United Students Against Sweatshops, Chancellor Henry T. Yang, Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services Marc Fisher and UCSB Bookstore director Mark Beisecker agreed in a meeting on Wednesday in room 5123 of Cheadle Hall to halt the Bookstore’s non-backpack apparel purchases from Jansport and discuss alternatives to Jansport backpacks in summer meetings.</p>\n<p>USAS came to the meeting demanding the Bookstore licensees be signatories to the Accord on Fire Building Safety in Bangladesh, a legally binding document that outlines factory safety standards for corporations. Because Jansport is owned by VF Corporation, whose practices in Bangladesh do not adhere to the accord, USAS demanded the Bookstore stop buying the company’s products. At the meeting, Yang also agreed to advocate for similar changes UC-wide by speaking with other chancellors.</p>\n<p>USAS member and third-year global studies major Brandon Yadegari said he became concerned about the Bookstore licensing relationships after Rana Plaza, a factory in Bangladesh, collapsed in April of 2013, killing over 1,100 workers.</p>\n<p>“Since Rana Plaza collapsed in April of 2013, it has been pretty disturbing to us to find out about the relationships and connections between manufacturers that sell clothes to our bookstore,” Yadegari said.</p>\n<p>Yadegari said the Bookstore should not work with companies that have factories in Bangladesh such as VF, especially because collegiate apparel is a major source of its profit.</p>\n<p>“In Bangladesh, where wages are the lowest in the world and factories are the most unsafe, it seemed apparent to us as a group to work to make sure our university does not do business with companies that … are unwilling to cooperate for safer standards for those workers or who are owned by a company that participates in such supply chain management,” Yadegari said.</p>\n<p>According to Yadegari, while no products in the Bookstore are made in Bangladesh, profits from Jansport products go to VF, which is responsible for serious workers’ rights abuse overseas.</p>\n<p>“VF, their parent company, who owns brands like Vans, North Face and Columbia, still maintains much of their production in Bangladesh, and maintain production that is secured through relationships with local, provincial governments in Bangladesh that have consistently suppressed unionization attempts through violence, in some cases killing,” Yadegari said.</p>\n<p>Yang said he would rather work with other UC chancellors to affect system-wide change than act independently as a campus.</p>\n<p>“Many issues are joined issues. If we work together, we have better results,” Yang said. “This is not an isolated issue like an I.V. issue. This is such a good opportunity for me to bring them all on board.”</p>\n<p>Beisecker also said he advised against campus-level action to halt business with Jansport, because it may be politically unsound given other UC campuses also use the company.</p>\n<p>“For me to pull the license from Jansport and for the other campuses to keep theirs, is a real mixed message,” Beisecker said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64013\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64013\" data-attachment-id=\"64013\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/students-demand-that-bookstore-discontinue-jansport-products/usas_by-lorenzo-basilio-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1433330593\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"120\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"USAS_by Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64013\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?resize=400%2C267\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/USAS_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-64013\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Yadegari, multiple campus leadership entities unanimously voted to support a discontinuation of business with Jansport, meaning Yang should meet UCSB USAS’s demand rather than rely upon UC-wide alternatives.</p>\n<p>“We’re coming in with right now, UCSB students, UCSB Associated Students, UCSB Academic Senate, UCSB Graduate Student Association, Chancellor’s Sustainability Committee, obviously USAS, obviously the 2,000 signatures that we got, want action at UCSB,” Yadegari said. “For Chancellor Yang to see our university and our climate and then have to ask other UCs, there is a little bit of a disconnect there.”</p>\n<p>USAS member and first-year math major Kyle Butts said other university campuses have adopted the accord.</p>\n<p>“The decision is not unprecedented,” Butts said. “There are campuses like NYU, Stanford, University of Michigan. There are over 40 universities that have acquired the accord, so we are not alone.”</p>\n<p>Butts said because the UC Code of Conduct for Trademark Licensees Steering Committee’s vastly supported resolution asking UC to adopt the Accord was rejected by UC President Janet Napolitano last summer in favor of allowing UC to do business with signatories of either the Accord or the much more lenient Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, USAS has little faith in the notion of UC-wide reform.</p>\n<p>“We saw UC-wide support. Every campus was in support of trying to get the Accord to be passed, and we saw the recommendation that UC as a whole should require the Accord,” Butts said. “There was so much support for that, and then it seemed like President Napolitano on her own decision ignored the recommendation and said the Alliance or the Accord.”</p>\n<p>According to Yadegari, the Alliance gives corporations more flexibility in determining their own safety standards, which discouraged many student and faculty activists who had campaigned for UC adoption of the much stricter Accord.</p>\n<p>“The Office of the President handed down the decision that either the Accord or the Alliance would be required, essentially giving a lot of companies an easier way out of holding themselves accountable and responsible for the conditions that they perpetuate in Bangladesh,” Yadegari said. “I think that was really demoralizing for a lot of us.”</p>\n<p>Yadegari said, given the shortfall of Napolitano’s decision, campus USASs need to take initiative.</p>\n<p>“At this point, with UC-wide activism being forced into retreat after the president’s decision, USAS at UCSB has come back and said ‘our chancellor will listen to us, we want to work with him, we want to work with our administration,’” Yadegari said.</p>\n<p>USAS member and third-year global studies major Dana Patterson said through campus-level adoption of the Accord, UCSB can lead the way for UC-wide change.</p>\n<p>“Our focus has been on this and them being able to extend that to the other UCs, and that’s just our strategy as of right now,” Patterson said. “We’re the most active USAS campus, so we’re very much leading the way … We’re the strongest organization of the UCs working on this. We’re the most proactive group.”</p>\n<p>According to Butts, UCSB’s independent adoption of the Accord could be the most effective step toward UC adoption.</p>\n<p>“By UCSB leading the way and forcing strictly the accord … we could rejuvenate a lot of the activity campaigns toward the Accord,” Butts said. “If UCSB makes the first stride to require the Bangladesh Accord, that gives the committee more power for producing another resolution for Janet Napolitano.”</p>\n<p>Yadegari said Yang needed to represent the student body by supporting the Bookstore’s adoption of the Accord rather than consider UC politics.</p>\n<p>“We can make our own decisions. Every relevant governing body on campus has told you want they want you to do” Yadegari said. “We understand it’s hard for you to put your neck out on the line, but when every student is telling you to, you should.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Beisecker, Fisher and Yang agreed the Bookstore should initiate adoption of the Accord by stopping orders from Jansport for non-backpack apparel, but Fisher said backpack orders would have to continue until USAS presented a comparable alternative.</p>\n<p>“We’re not driving the market, the market drives us,” Fisher said. “We have to find a product line that will replace the one we already have.”</p>\n<p>Yang said while he will support a UCSB initiative, he still plans to talk to other chancellors to implement similar change on other campuses.</p>\n<p>“I am willing to talk to them, I will be strategically talking to them,” Yang said. “You have more work to do to go to the other students and say ‘we met with our chancellor, have you met with yours?’”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Thursday, June 4, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Anthony Lai/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be the fourth time Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) has introduced such a resolution. The most recent attempt occurred in 2015, when the bill </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/divestment-resolution-falls-two-votes-short-of-passing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">failed to pass</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with then-Internal Vice President Angela Lau casting the tie-breaking “no” vote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators Jonathan Lopez and Unique Vance will first introduce the resolution; afterward, student sponsors Anumita Kaur and Edan Tessema will have a chance to speak. The public will then be able to discuss their own opinions on the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aaron Jones, the A.S. assistant director for community affairs, student engagement and advocacy, said these hearings have been widely attended by students in the past.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even for a spectator observing the dynamics of the room itself, [it’s] very polarizing. One half of the room has one particular position, the other half of the room has an opposing position,” Jones said. “These meetings are well attended such that they often have to be moved to Corwin Pavilion to accommodate the hundreds of people that show up.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student group Students for Justice in Palestine </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/26-student-groups-support-bds-resolution/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first released the resolution</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the public on April 24. Since then, the resolution has been endorsed by 36 student organizations on campus including the Student Activist Network. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If passed, the resolution will prompt A.S. to divest from companies such as Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Caterpillar and Hewlett Packard. According to the bill, these corporations have provided Israel with military aid in attacks on Gaza.</span></p>\n<p>SJP acknowledged that A.S. UCSB does not hold any investments in these companies, but they hope the bill will spur A.S. to take an active role in advocating for the UC to divest.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday, eight Jewish student organizations published a joint statement opposing the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We feel for the Palestinians and Israelis, and we work actively to promote speakers and projects that help bring both sides together toward a peaceful solution,” the statement read. “We, the Jewish student leaders of UCSB, are united in rejecting this one sided, counterproductive, and incredibly hurtful BDS [Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions] resolution.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Members of both sides hope students come out for the meeting. Kaur, a fourth-year sociology major, said attending the meeting is relevant for UC Santa Barbara students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Folks don’t have to make a statement; folks don’t have to stay the whole time, but coming out is important,” she said. “This is the money of every single student on this campus, and so this pertains to every single student on this campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talia Karu, a third-year biopsychology major and the president of the student board at Santa Barbara Hillel, is planning to attend the meeting in opposition to the resolution. She said she hopes that students who attend the meeting will try to understand both perspectives of the topic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Anything you’re going to hear about this issue is going to be biased, one side or another,” she said. “If you do go, try and take everything with a grain of salt, and try to understand that it’s a very personal issue … [It’s important] to keep that in mind and to respect both sides of the matter.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77740\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-10/sjp-to-move-for-divestment-a-fourth-time/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77740\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-10/sjp-to-move-for-divestment-a-fourth-time/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-10/sjp-to-move-for-divestment-a-fourth-time/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-10/sjp-to-move-for-divestment-a-fourth-time/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-10/sjp-to-move-for-divestment-a-fourth-time/","id":2740,"author":{"id":99,"name":"Parry Dong"},"related":[2739,2738,2737],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New A.S.

Sworn in May 27 to fill vacancies left by three senators who stepped down shortly after the spring elections, on-campus senator and first-year undeclared major Elizabeth Brock and on-campus senator and first-year political science major Mercedes Rodriguez were selected by a special committee after an interview process to replace Brendan Korbas and David Xie. Off-campus senator and second-year political science major Kelly Pearman replaced Jake Johnson after having been his runner-up in the spring 2015 elections.</p>\n<p><b>ON-CAMPUS SENATOR </b><b>ELIZABETH BROCK</b></p>\n<p><b><i>Daily Nexus</i></b><b>: Why did you apply to be an on-campus senator?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>: I love being involved and am extremely passionate about impacting lives; I felt this position could give me a better chance in reaching as many students as possible across our campus and that my plans to impact our shared community could be put in motion more effectively and efficiently.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: Have you been involved with A.S. before?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>: I have not, so this is very exciting for me!</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: How have you been involved at UCSB?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>: This past year, I’ve been the president of the amazing Santa Cruz Residence Hall … Being president automatically placed me in the Residence Halls Association … where I also discovered my passion for student affairs. I’m also a newer part of the National Residence Hall Honorary, or NRHH, and it’s been great getting to know that new family as well.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What do you hope to accomplish this year?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>: I hope to eventually separate Counseling and Psychological Services [C.A.P.S.] from Career Services, as they’re both currently housed in the same building … It’s absurd that certain counselors at C.A.P.S. have offices the size of closets … I believe the C.A.P.S. building should also be painted and possibly renovated. Hopefully, there can be a collaboration with our university’s art department to create some beautiful murals over that Pepto-Bismol pink. That space is supposed to be a welcoming invitation for students seeking help, and walking up to that building illustrates the exact opposite. We should feel motivated and inspired when entering the C.A.P.S. environment, and brightening its atmosphere would truly help.</p>\n<p>Another project I’d like to take on is placing mental health kits in every room of every residence hall before move-in day Fall Quarter. I feel this will show incoming as well as returning students how valuable and vital our mental well-being is. By placing these kits in the rooms first thing, we’ll be able to create a healthier, more active and more knowledgeable mental health environment where students will hopefully begin to value their internal well-being much more seriously.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: Why do you think you will be a good senator?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>: I am straightforward when addressing situations, and I’m not afraid to communicate when hard conversations are needed … My compassion for others and my overall love for our university drives my passion to be in this position and will allow me to work devotedly and wholeheartedly towards every goal that’s in front of me. I maintain a very open mind, and I love to hear about ways to improve what’s already set in motion. I believe in listening to other perspectives before solidifying any decision … I am qualified with leading a council and being an active and leading member in multiple organizations through high school to now. I enjoy working in a team and deeply value collaboration and coexisting efforts to get things done, which I believe will help me connect with departments across campus to complete my mental health projects.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What do you want to change about A.S.?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>:  A.S. should not be about who’s in which party, who has the greatest ego or who’s enemies and friends with who. There should not be that internal drama because it infects the organization and results negatively in helping our community and constituents. We should all be working together towards the same goal of bettering our campus to brighten student lives.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>OFF-CAMPUS SENATOR KELLY PEARMAN</b></p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: Why did you run to be an off-campus senator?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: I chose to run to be a senator because I really wanted the opportunity to improve the campus and community for students and Isla Vista residents. I really have the passion to be a voice for students and I am so excited to be one of their representatives. I can’t wait to create change.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What experience do you have being involved in the UCSB community?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: I have been involved in A.S. for the past two years. As a first-year, I was a fellow in the Internal Vice President’s Office. During my second year at UCSB, I was the senate coordinator in the Internal Vice President’s Office and I was also the recruitment and outreach coordinator for Committee on Committees.</p>\n<p>I am a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma. I was also involved with RHA during my first year at UCSB.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What projects do you want to complete as a senator this year?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: My first project goal is to create a more interactive training for sexual assault intervention and prevention. I want to work with Panhellenic and Interfraternity Council to implement this. Also, I want to collaborate with my fellow senators Austin Hechler and Mika Kawakami on this project, who also have knowledge about Greek life.</p>\n<p>Another project I want to work on is developing a long-term parking plan in Isla Vista … It is creating safety problems and causing I.V. residents to receive citations. I want to work with the EVPLA Office and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol on this project along with holding forums for students to voice their opinion on how they want parking to change in the future. Having a lot of student input is really important.</p>\n<p>My third project goal is to create vending machines in Isla Vista with school and study supplies in them so students can access these resources at any time of the day. A few previous senators have worked on this project, and I want to continue it and implement it.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What do you think will be your biggest challenge during your time as off-campus senator?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: I expect that it will be challenging to work with 24 other very passionate people, and I know some meetings will be difficult when our opinions clash.</p>\n<p>People will disagree, but I plan to put myself in other people’s shoes to understand where they are coming from. I think it’s really important to try to understand why people believe the things they do and that will really help me in deciding about legislation and working with people throughout the year.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What do you want incoming senators to do differently than their predecessors?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: I think that the Senate should really take the time and effort during the first few weeks of the term to really get to know the Legal Code, the financial policies and the structure of the association itself. When Senators are more knowledgeable about the association and its governing documents, etcetera, they will be able to navigate it a lot better when writing legislation and when they are initiating projects.</p>\n<p>Senators should definitely take extra steps to work with Senators that they normally hadn’t already worked with. It makes Senate a closer group of people with better camaraderie and working rapport.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What will make you a good senator?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: I have been very involved in A.S. for the last two years, and this gives me the experience and knowledge about what students want, and how we as student leaders can give that to them. Being the senate coordinator for a year gave me the knowledge of what it means and what it takes to be a great senator. I also have worked with past senators on projects and legislation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>ON-CAMPUS SENATOR MERCEDES RODRIGUEZ</b></p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: </b><b>Why did you apply to be an on-campus senator?</b></p>\n<p><em>Rodriguez:</em> At first, I didn’t know much about it, so my RA kind of encouraged me because I’m in Hall Council currently and he thought it would be a good fit for me, and he also explained to me how we can help advocate for students and get their voices heard, and that’s what I really want to focus on, being a political science major actually wanting to go into activism.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: How have you been involved at UCSB?</b></p>\n<p><em>Rodriguez: </em>I actually wasn’t involved in A.S., I was just involved in Hall Council. I was a multicultural awareness chair, so I pick up on all of the isms, and that made me a lot more aware … I think knowing a lot more of those ideas is going to help me just kind of implement the things that I actually want to see being done … I think racism is going to be a huge one.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What are your goals for the coming year?</b></p>\n<p><em>Rodriguez: </em>Definitely just trying to push for diversity, I think that’s going to be my focal point for this year. Not necessarily to offset the demographics, but kind of teach people that our demographics are not as correct as some people might think they are, and that the underrepresented do have a voice and they’re actually very vital to our school. So I’m going to be focusing definitely on the minorities and just having their voices heard and all their work being recognized.</p>\n<p>Living on the multicultural floor this year, I know I definitely want to bring it back because I know it is going to change into a first-generation floor. But I want to bring back the multicultural floor definitely because I feel like it had a huge impact on my overall experience of being a first-year … For now, that’s the only concrete idea I have, because I just currently was aware that I got into office.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What do you think will be your biggest challenge as a senator?</b></p>\n<p><em>Rodriguez: </em>Being biracial, first of all, because I am Caucasian and I am Hispanic so it’s kind of hard to be myself in both positions, because I do look more Hispanic, I get mistaken for being full Hispanic … I’m going to try to understand both sides of the spectrum, but it’s just going to be really hard.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63991\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-02/new-a-s-senators-discuss-goals-for-upcoming-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63991\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-02/new-a-s-senators-discuss-goals-for-upcoming-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-02/new-a-s-senators-discuss-goals-for-upcoming-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-02/new-a-s-senators-discuss-goals-for-upcoming-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-02/new-a-s-senators-discuss-goals-for-upcoming-year/","id":2738,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[2737,2736,2735],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
