UCSB, which has not been updated since 1995. Graduate students hope it will protect them from “abusing power.” <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB’s Graduate Student Association (GSA) is proposing a revised graduate student Bill of Rights for the first time since 1995 to protect graduate students from abuse and exploitation.</p>\n<p>The GSA passed the newly drafted Bill of Rights in its General Assembly meeting on April 5. Representatives submitted the draft to the Academic Senate on Monday and hope to present before the Senate’s Graduate Council soon.</p>\n<p>The Bill of Rights currently in action at UCSB was drafted and ratified in 1995. The University of California Student Association (UCSA) drafted a system-wide graduate student Bill of Rights in 2011 and UCSB’s GSA informally approved it soon after.</p>\n<p>GSA Vice President of Student Affairs Kathy Swift initiated the revised Bill of Rights in December and said she expanded upon UCSA’s 2011 Bill to make the new Bill. The 2011 Bill is about 20 pages long, and the recently passed draft is about 21 pages long.</p>\n<p>“I just basically beefed it up and expanded a couple parts that I thought were needing more support, more explanation,” Swift said.</p>\n<p>Swift said the new bill adds language allowing for the creation of a graduate student advocate position and a shared governance board. Her vision is that the graduate student advocate would be someone students could rely on to “negotiate through the bureaucracy” and resolve disputes.</p>\n<p>The shared governance board, Swift said, would be a group of student representatives, including the graduate student advocate, with voting power in the Academic Senate. Swift said members of the Academic Senate might be skeptical of allowing a shared governance board.</p>\n<p>“That’s a real touchy one,” Swift said. “That’s where we’re going to get into some negotiation.”</p>\n<p>According to Swift, the need for a revised Bill of Rights comes from the “touchy and more sensitive relationship” between graduate students and the university. She said academic departments typically consider graduate students as low‐level associates rather than colleagues.</p>\n<p>“We encounter situations where we’re exploited or we’re taken advantage of or we’re not respected,” Swift said. “That can really be destructive for our academic careers.”</p>\n<p>Timothy Irvine, GSA vice president of committees, helped Swift draft the bill and said advisers have strong influence over a graduate student’s professional life through letters of recommendation, networking and aid in publishing.</p>\n<p>Graduate students are “basically working under a group of like three to six people who have control over all of those things,” Irvine said. “So, if they decide to abuse their power, your ability to respond to that is extremely limited.”</p>\n<p>Irvine said the university currently has a process in place by which graduate students can respond to abuse, but he said these efforts are “akin to Band‐Aids on bullet holes.”</p>\n<p>“There is a method for adjudication, but it doesn’t necessarily work that well, and it doesn’t necessarily give people justice,” Irvine said.</p>\n<p>Yanira Rivas Pineda, the GSA external vice president, said having a graduate student Bill of Rights is necessary to help graduate students who are in dysfunctional relationships with their advisors.</p>\n<p>“As graduate students, we sacrifice our financial stability and basically put our life on hold for a few years,” Pineda said in an email. “The last thing we need is to have to navigate conflicts on our own with little to no support or guidance.”</p>\n<p>Swift said the 1995 Bill of Rights in action across the university, drafted in 1995, offers basic protections to graduate students, but is incomplete.</p>\n<p>“It is not comprehensive,” Swift said. “It doesn’t cover a lot of areas that graduate students need.”</p>\n<p>Swift said she needs to consult with the Academic Senate and the Graduate Division, otherwise the newly revised graduate student Bill of Rights will not be enforced.</p>\n<p>“[Graduate students] don’t have that much in the way of enforcement power at all, which is why it’s necessary for us to try to negotiate this with the Graduate Division and the Academic Senate,” Swift said. “They’re the ones that will make the enforcement.”</p>\n<p>Swift said representatives of the Academic Senate and the Graduate Division have already begun to express skepticism toward the new draft in her meetings with them.</p>\n<p>“This is going to cause problems,” Swift said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, April 14,

decision to a vote from the entire university faculty, including professors, assistant professors and lecturers.</p>\n<p>GSA’s resolution will ask that at least two graduate students be allowed as members of the hiring committee, with access to all necessary materials for making informed decisions. Graduate students of the department will democratically elect the two representatives, according to Yanira Rivas Pineda, graduate student and GSA’s Vice President of External Affairs.</p>\n<p>“We think that a minimum of two students should be included in the hiring process,” Pineda said in an email. “To have only one student and the rest of the committee members be faculty might be intimidating for a student.”</p>\n<p>Pineda said graduate students work closely with faculty as their research assistants, teaching assistants and mentees and it is important for graduate students to understand the faculty hiring process.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69774\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69774\" data-attachment-id=\"69774\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gsa-resolution-aims-to-include-graduate-students-in-faculty-hiring-committees/gsa-lounge-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"GSA Lounge\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69774\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3-1024x682.jpg?resize=450%2C300\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69774\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“It helps with our professional development because we get to learn first-hand what the hiring process looks like, how to craft competitive [curriculum vitaes], teaching statements, and what faculty are looking for in prospective applicants,” Pineda said in an email.</p>\n<p>By drafting the proposal, UCSB is joining a system-wide effort through the UC Student Association Graduate and Professional Committee.</p>\n<p>In August 2014, the Graduate and Professional Committee of UCSA adopted the Graduate Students Democratizing Education (GrADE) campaign. According to Pineda, UC Berkeley’s GSA drafted and passed a resolution in favor of GrADE and other UC graduate students hope to pass similar resolutions.</p>\n<p>“The campaign … addressed problems with the lack of faculty diversity (in all forms), finding adequate mentorship and faculty with research projects that reflect the 21st century graduate population,” Pineda said in an email.</p>\n<p>Iman Sylvain, UC Berkeley’s Graduate Assembly Vice President of External Affairs, said she helped write a resolution that endorses the full and permanent participation of graduate students in faculty hiring processes with equal rights to interview and provide input as faculty.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“This is 50 years after Jim Crow and the Civil Rights Act and somehow we still don’t have very many professors of color — kind of a problem.” — Timothy Irvine</p></blockquote>\n<p>“The UC acknowledges that it lags behind peer institutions in hiring women and underrepresented minorities,” Pineda said in an email. “We believe that having the next generation of faculty (those of us being trained to become professors) being part of the hiring process is [a] small but necessary step in democratizing the hiring process and our university.”</p>\n<p>According to Timothy Irvine, GSA’s Vice President of Committees and Planning and graduate student, a small percentage of tenured or tenured-track faculty are African American. He said having younger, more diverse people involved in hiring committees would play an important role in increasing diversity.</p>\n<p>“This is 50 years after Jim Crow and the Civil Rights Act and somehow we still don’t have very many professors of color — kind of a problem,” Irvine said. “Hiring committees are a big part of the solution to that problem.”</p>\n<p>Irvine also said having graduate students who are being taught by faculty on these committees would be a “very logical next step towards shared governance” between students and universities.</p>\n<p>Irvine said UCSB’s current system is “decentralized” and graduate student voices are heard differently in each department’s hiring process.</p>\n<p>“That is done in the name of academic freedom, but what you also get is like a patchwork of adherence to different conduct codes and legal codes,” Irvine said.</p>\n<p>Some GSA members expressed concern about the change creating too much pressure for graduate students who find themselves in disagreement with department faculty. Others questioned whether graduate students should have voting powers.</p>\n<p>“I believe that these concerns are precisely why we need to include graduate students in the hiring process,” Pineda said in an email. “Those of us who are going to stay in the academy should be able to experience the hiring process from the other side and not just when we’re out in the job market.”</p>\n<p>GSA members are in the process of modifying their initial draft, and will bring the resolution to a vote during a General Assembly Meeting on May 3.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this story misquoted Timothy Irvine as saying “Human Rights Act” instead of “Civil Rights Act.” The article has been updated accordingly. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69736\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gsa-resolution-aims-to-include-graduate-students-in-faculty-hiring-committees/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69736\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gsa-resolution-aims-to-include-graduate-students-in-faculty-hiring-committees/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gsa-resolution-aims-to-include-graduate-students-in-faculty-hiring-committees/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gsa-resolution-aims-to-include-graduate-students-in-faculty-hiring-committees/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gsa-resolution-aims-to-include-graduate-students-in-faculty-hiring-committees/","id":2504,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2503,2502,2501],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bassem Eid: Divestment Movement Hurts Palestine","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-04-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LMB_2190.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LMB_2190.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB students and Goleta residents gathered Thursday evening in the MCC to hear a human rights activist discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a path toward peace and the divestment movement.

If I will boycott Israel tomorrow morning, how can I survive? Will BDS find me a job? Will BDS feed my children?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supporters of BDS and members of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) have criticized Eid’s stance. Audience members called him a “traitor” in February at the University of Chicago, and just days before his UCSB event, SJP and the Muslim Students Association at Cal State Long Beach protested his lecture there. At UCSB, campus security was present, but the event proceeded without incident. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kayla Shenassa, a second-year classics major, organized Eid’s lecture without the aid of any student organization by contacting the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA), the agency overseeing his tour, after noticing Eid was speaking at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p> If I will boycott Israel tomorrow morning, how can I survive? Will BDS find me a job? Will BDS feed my children?” — Baseem Eid</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s important for our community and students on either side, or on no side, of this issue to hear the truth, and Bassem is one of the biggest sources of truth on this issue because of his background as a Palestinian human rights activist,” Shenassa said. “The reality is that BDS is not conducive to peace whether it’s on campus or in the Middle East.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to denouncing BDS, Eid spoke on topics ranging from his arrest by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in 1996 to the corruption of Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian National Authority.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eid maintains that the only solution to the plight of Palestinians must be one that improves the economic standing of his people. He said over 92,000 Palestinian workers currently hold Israeli work permits and enter Israel to work for the companies BDS seeks to divest from.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He pointed at the closure of a SodaStream factory that BDS successfully forced to move out of the West Bank as a disaster for 1,500 Palestinian workers who lost jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Palestinians living in the West Bank are not worried about settlements,” Eid said. “They are worried about having a job and how they will feed their families.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about the plight of Gaza, Eid said he places most of the responsibility on Hamas, the ruling government there, which the United States recognizes as a terrorist organization and Eid calls a “dictatorship.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>“To SJP, my message is one message: The only ones who will succeed to bring justice to the Palestinians will be the Palestinians themselves.” — Baseem Eid</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want BDS to come to the leaders of Hamas by asking why the leadership imposed three wars on the Gaza strip,” Eid said. “I think the survival of the Gazan people is the responsibility of the Hamas organization.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eid gave individual messages for SJP members and BDS advocates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To SJP, my message is one message: The only ones who will succeed to bring justice to the Palestinians will be the Palestinians themselves,” Eid said. “To the BDS, I have to say you are killing our economy. You are destroying our economy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SJP representatives who attended the lecture declined to comment.</span></p>\n<p>When asked what BDS supporters can do to help the Palestinian people, Eid suggested investing rather than divesting.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If the BDS will succeed to persuade Palestinian billionaires who are living abroad to invest in Gaza and the West Bank, I will look at that as a huge help,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goleta resident Andriana Goodell said she came to learn from someone with “relevant experience” of the conflict.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I saw it advertised in my community center and thought it was interesting that Eid lived for 33 years in Shuafat,” Goodell said. “I learned good information from a person with relevant experience toward the Palestinian and Israeli conflict.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eidan Shalom, a third-year psychology major, served in the Israeli Defense Forces from 2011 to 2013 and is the president and founder of Students Supporting Israel at UCSB. Although he disagreed with Eid’s call to open up Israel’s borders, he agreed with Eid’s views on BDS.</span><br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Palestinians need economic prosperity,” Shalom said. “When BDS thinks they are targeting Israel, in reality they are targeting Israeli businesses, which actually employ thousands of Palestinians.”</span></p>\n<p><em>[Correction: In an earlier version of this article, Mahmoud Abbas was referenced as the President of the State of Palestine.
