Daily Nexus won six awards from the California College Media Assocation on Friday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The <i>Daily Nexus</i> won six awards from the California College Media Association on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The <i>Nexus</i> placed first in five categories for weekly newspapers — best website, best headline portfolio, best photo series, best editorial and best breaking news story — and also placed third in best news photograph.</p>\n<p>Emile Nelson, the paper’s editor in chief, said in a statement that he “couldn’t be happier with the results of this year’s CCMAs.”</p>\n<p>Even better than the awards “is knowing that each and every one was earned through the dedication and passion of the students here at the <i>Nexus,</i>” Nelson said.</p>\n<p>“That’s what makes us a nationally ranked newspaper and that’s what’s going to keep us serving this community in the best way we possibly can — the passion, honesty and ability of the students at the <i>Nexus</i>.”</p>\n<p>The judges wrote that <i>DailyNexus.com</i> “excelled with a clean and well-organized home page, strong navigation tools and a wide variety of content,” adding, “An easy-to-use search tool helps find stories as far back as 2000.”</p>\n<p><i>Nexus </i>Copy Chief Simone Dupuy won best headline portfolio for what judges wrote was a good mix of “inventive and informative heads.” The headlines included “<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/\" target=\"_blank\">Waive Goodbye to Your Financial Aid</a>” and “<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/deltopia-2015-boots-on-the-ground-but-its-still-going-down/\" target=\"_blank\">Deltopia 2015: Boots on the Ground, But It’s Still Going

According to Marez, many farm workers have started social justice movements to combat inequalities created by corporate capitalism and government policies. Marez’s talk was the last lecture in the MCC’s Race Matters Series.</p>\n<p>Associate Professor in the Chican@ Studies Department Dolores Inés Casillas introduced Marez and said she has appreciated his writing since he was president of the American Studies Association.</p>\n<p>“I am excited to see him on our campus,” Casillas said. “Something that is really dear to my heart is that Curtis is the first person whose work I read. I read an article by him, and it was the first time I felt I had to email the person and tell them this was an incredible piece of writing.”</p>\n<p>Casillas said Marez’s hometown of Turlock, California is present in his writing and adds to his understanding of farming in the Central Valley.</p>\n<p>“He references not just the Central Valley, but in a way in which we understand that farm hands have created and cultivated a specific culture in the Central Valley,” Casillas said.</p>\n<p>According to Marez, farm workers have been leaders in visionary thinking about the future of technology, but little is known of their work.</p>\n<p>“One index of farm worker exploitation is the fact that they have often been the objects, but rarely the subjects of media representation,” Marez said. “There is a vast archive of photos and films of farm workers, but there are far fewer well-known examples of visual media produced by them.”</p>\n<p>Marez said California farm workers unions have organized and created their own media to fight agribusiness domination of visual technology.</p>\n<p>“Farm workers have undermined agribusiness representations of workers as mere machines of production, by themselves mobilizing media technologies,” Marez said. “Appropriations of cameras and other visual technologies by farm worker unions have both material and symbolic force, making exploitation visible while simultaneously seizing the means of visual reproduction.”</p>\n<p>Marez showed attendees a clip of Cesar Chavez dancing to remind them of the utopian, world-changing arc of the farm worker’s movement. Cesar Chavez, American farm worker and labor rights activist, founded the United Farm Workers (UFW).</p>\n<p>“We are used to seeing Chavez in a serious mode,” Marez said. “Just remember that he was a person who danced, who had desires for pleasure and pursued those desires I think is something that is important. Part of what I wanted to talk about today is the utopian future orientation of United Farm Workers in what I am calling <em>Farm Worker: Futurism</em>.”</p>\n<p>According to Marez, his book is an interdisciplinary study of the material and symbolic significance of technology in conflicts between agribusiness corporations and workers of color in California from the 1940s to present day.</p>\n<p>“An important practical and symbolic means of exploiting and disciplining labor [and] agribusiness technology also became the medium and object of struggle over the future of California agriculture and the larger cultural and political context supporting it,” Marez said.</p>\n<p>Marez said farm workers have used technology to draw attention to the agribusiness flaws in using mechanized labor, industrial work camps and pesticides in the fields.</p>\n<p>“They have also responded to the agribusiness efforts to dominate the visual field by turning a critical gaze on agribusiness in numerous graphics, photos, films and videos, thus decoupling technology from an exclusive connection to patriarchal white capitalism,” Marez said.</p>\n<p>Marez showed artwork by members of the Royal Chicano Air Force, a Chicano artist collective, and said the images show flight and the technologies of agribusiness, such as the crop duster.</p>\n<p>“All of the images in this project from the Royal Chicano Air Force are from special collections here at UC Santa Barbara,” Marez said. “So there is an incredibly rich collection of visual art related to the Chicano movement right here on this campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Marez, farm workers unions have tried to mobilize media technology to open spaces for supporters. Marez said Cesar Chavez’s famous slogans “Si Se Puede” and “It Can Be Done” demonstrate the uniting qualities of the farm worker movement.</p>\n<p>“Qualities that resonated with post-war decolonization and third-wordlist movements,” Marez said. “The worlds that farm workers built were shaped by both local and global concerns.”</p>\n<p>Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman, Programmer of the MCC, said she enjoyed how Marez allowed the audience to choose a topic of discussion for his lecture.</p>\n<p>“I really appreciated how Dr. Marez was so interactive with the audience and allowed them to choose where to take the lecture.

According to a 2015 report, the United Nations believes ISIS is holding over 3,500 people as slaves and is responsible for the displacement and deaths of tens of thousands of civilians.</p>\n<p>Juergensmeyer opened the talk by discussing his recent experience interviewing refugees in Erbil, Iraq who were fleeing ISIS, which he said opened his perspective on what ISIS is and who is supporting it.</p>\n<p>Juergensmeyer recounted the tale of a refugee policeman whose cousin had joined simply because he was making more money than if he was fighting in the Iraqi army.</p>\n<p>According to Juergensmeyer, the November terrorist attacks in Paris were a way for ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi “to show others that the war is real.”</p>\n<p>“He [al-Baghdadi] can go to Paris and put on a pretend war, and suddenly, he’s back in the headlines,” Juergensmeyer said.</p>\n<p>Juergensmeyer said for al-Baghdadi, recruiting foreigners to fight for ISIS in Iraq and Syria has been an effective strategy.</p>\n<p>“Al-Baghdadi is bringing them there as an intimidation force so that he can control the Sunnis in the region from rebelling and turning against him,” Juergensmeyer said.</p>\n<p>Juergensmeyer said although it is still present and dangerous threat, ISIS has recently lost momentum.</p>\n<p>“Not only did ISIS lose territory in 2015, but young people are fleeing from ISIS in droves,” Juergensmeyer said.</p>\n<p>Max Peck, third-year communication major and veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, works at UCSB’s Veteran Resource Center and helped organize the event. Peck said the event aimed to shed light on the veteran community at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“One of my goals while I’m here is to make our community more visible, and I view this as a really good way to make us more visible, not only to faculty, but to students at UCSB,” Peck said.</p>\n<p>First-year global studies major Charlie Wang said he took a global studies course with Juergensmeyer and considers him an authority on the issue of global terrorism.</p>\n<p>“Professor Juergensmeyer was very knowledgeable about different issues going on around the world, especially ISIS,” Wang said. “It was also very interesting to hear all the different perspectives from the different professors in different departments.”</p>\n<p>Second-year global studies major Nathan Garrido said he attended the event in pursuit of information on ISIS and its global influence.</p>\n<p>“The topic that was discussed is super relevant right now — it’s not a conversation that has been going on long enough and we have not had enough people involved,” Garrido said. “It was a great way to get faculty to interact with students and have this open discussion.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68323\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/ucsb-students-faculty-discuss-isis-and-refugees/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68323\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/ucsb-students-faculty-discuss-isis-and-refugees/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/ucsb-students-faculty-discuss-isis-and-refugees/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/ucsb-students-faculty-discuss-isis-and-refugees/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/ucsb-students-faculty-discuss-isis-and-refugees/","id":2531,"author":{"id":117,"name":"Effie Sklavenitis"},"related":[2530,2529,2528],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Overview of New A.S.

Open People’s Party (OPP), which accomplished a near-sweep in last year’s elections, will not be participating, and many of its old members now identify with the new groups.</p>\n<p>In October, A Bill to Change Associated Students Elections to a Single Transferrable Vote (STV) passed and will be implemented this spring. Under STV, each voter will rank the candidates to their preference and will have a single vote that is initially allocated to their most preferred candidate. As the votes continue to be counted and candidates are either elected or eliminated, the vote is transferred to other candidates according to the voter’s stated preferences in proportion to any surplus votes. The reallocation of votes may vary.</p>\n<p>Nawar Nemeh, author of the legislation and second-year history of public policy and global studies double major, said the new system will create more proportional representation in A.S.</p>\n<p>“The single transferrable vote was a new voting system we passed in the fall to increase proportional representation,” Nemeh said. “The idea behind STV and proportional representation is that on the ballot, voters can rank their candidates, and there’s a mathematical formula that takes all your choices into consideration. So if you’re a party that wins 60 percent of the vote, you’ll win 60 percent of representation.”</p>\n<h3>CAMPUS UNITED</h3>\n<p>Campus United, in its introductory letter to the student body, said students “are its priority.” They recognized the achievements of their party members, saying “although we are a new party, we take pride in the past accomplishments of our party leadership,” and are “eager to accomplish more on [the students’] behalf.”</p>\n<p>Letters and Science Collegiate Senator, Campus United member and third-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar said Campus United is focused on bringing attention to student fees and general student services because UCSB students pay the most in student fees amongst all 10 UCs.</p>\n<p>“Our party is focused on getting some of the conversations and things A.S. does refocused on student fees and general student services. Our party wants to focus on student fees and their proper use and management because we have the highest student fees out of any UC by a longshot,” Minoiefar said.<br>\nMinoiefar said Campus United is focused on moving forward based on reforms to the old structure of OPP.</p>\n<p>“The new party implemented a lot of changes I wanted to see in OPP, mostly internal and structural changes; nothing grandiose. We wanted to start something new and give everyone some breathing space,” Minoiefar said. “I didn’t leave [OPP] because all these things were wrong, I just realized that I’d rather to start something new. My concerns weren’t what OPP had done in the past, but what I could do in the future.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68390\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68390\" data-attachment-id=\"68390\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/overview-of-new-a-s-parties/parties_by-lorenzo-basilio-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Parties_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Parties_by Lorenzo Basilio-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Parties_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Parties_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68390\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Parties_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-4-1024x682.jpg?resize=450%2C300\" alt=\"Campus United members Austin Hechler and Ashcon Minoiefar both left OPP to join the party as a way to take the old party’s ideas and evolve them into something more.

Publications for course readers.</p>\n<p>“We value inclusivity; we believe that everyone has a spot. We want everyone to know more about A.S. and to feel like they can get involved. We work for all the students, so we want to make sure everyone feels welcome to the services and resources we provide,” Hechler said. “What we want to see changed is representation of Isla Vista as a community service district, the new fee initiative, utilization of the A.S. website that just launched and tagging different parts of campus that use student fees that are A.S.”</p>\n<p>Hechler ran as a senator with OPP last year and said that he left OPP to work alongside students with a more similar set of goals, but supports the creation of many new parties. He also said Campus United has learned from OPP and will be using the aspects OPP members thought were successful.</p>\n<p>“I left OPP because I found a group of like-minded people that also didn’t agree with certain things OPP did. It’s not any hard feelings, I feel like it’s just better to have more parties to come in and not just have one mega party that everyone knows. I think it’s awesome that so many new parties have formed,” Hechler said. “We’re not OPP anymore, I feel like we’ve learned from OPP and [are] using the aspects we thought were successful in our campaign.”</p>\n<p>Campus United party member and fourth-year anthropology and global studies double major Sarah Tagger said Campus United values the students’ voices, the representation of students in A.S. and the fulfillment of student visions.</p>\n<p>“Campus United values the amplification of the student voice and the fulfillment of student visions. We aspire to focus on clear consensus student issues, increase services, provide safety, and improve academic accessibility,” Tagger said in an email. “We believe that every student should be represented within Associated Students and utilize its resources. We are dedicated to transparency and open channels of communication.”</p>\n<p>Tagger also said Campus United was formed because party members were “dissatisfied with the status quo” and provides a new perspective and leadership for students that pledges to provide students with essential needs.</p>\n<p>“Campus United offers an entirely new perspective and new leadership that pledges to provide students with the essential needs that we have been collectively advocating for,” Tagger said. “We are a fresh, new party with a vision for a bright future.”</p>\n<p>To learn more about Campus United, visit ucsbcampusunited.com and facebook.com/UCSBCampusUnited or attend any of the informational sessions on Feb. 18 at Santa Barbara Hillel (781 Embarcadero del Norte) at 7p.m., Feb. 22 San Nicolas Classroom at 7p.m., or Feb. 23 at Santa Catalina Fiesta Room at 8p.m.</p>\n<h3>PEER ACTION COALITION</h3>\n<p>Peer Action Coalition (PAC) outlined its platform in its letter to the student body.

When you look at the party’s original core values of trying to represent all students and students to all have representation and non-toxic spaces where all students are able to have constructive dialogue, it veered away from that and it wasn’t really the centrist party it used to be,” Larrazolo said. “When you have a political party that runs for 10 years, it’s hard not to become a political machine.”</p>\n<p>According to Larrazolo, PAC is the center-left party and hopes to promote inclusion and safe spaces on UCSB’s campus. Larrazolo also said PAC wishes to focus on academics and to reinstate the Academic Affairs Board A.S. dissolved last year.</p>\n<p>“Academia is a big priority to us. The Academic Affairs Board was dissolved by A.S. last year, and that was very concerning as the CCS Senator because my job is to focus on academics,” Larrazolo said. “I think we’ve focused on that more than other parties.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo said PAC sees toxicity in previous A.S. elections and hopes to work collaboratively with the other parties to make sure elections are more transparent this year.</p>\n<p>“We want to reach out to the other parties to make sure that everyone is a student leader; a student first, leader second, and taking care of their mental health and treating themselves because nobody wants to come out of this being personally hurt or victimized because of personal agendas,” Larrozolo said.</p>\n<p>PAC member and third-year political science major Victor Garcia said PAC sees itself as a “hybrid” between Campus United and The Response, as they understand the need for activism and safe spaces on campus, but they also hope to represent the student population as a whole.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, we’re here to serve the students. We’re not here to serve ourselves. Regardless of what we think is necessary or right, we need to give in to what the students want,” Garcia said. “Ultimately, we want students to know that we want to represent them. Even if they don’t think A.S. is a space for them, we want them to feel comfortable enough to come to us and express their ideas.”</p>\n<p>To learn more about Peer Action Coalition, visit twitter.com/UCSBPAC and facebook.com/UCSBPAC.</p>\n<h3>THE RESPONSE</h3>\n<p>The Response prides itself on being a progressive party and a “response” to students’ concerns.</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator, The Response member and second-year Asian-American studies and political science double major Akshaya Natarajan said The Response was formed because of frustration with the lack of representation in A.S.</p>\n<p>“A lot of our members are from different parties and wanted to create a change and bring in more communities,” Natarajan said. “Our platform is centered around that, a lot of community building.”</p>\n<p>Natarajan also said tuition-free and debt-free education and student well-being are central to their platform.</p>\n<p>“Our party also believes a lot in the right of education. One part of our platform that I don’t see in other platforms is the right to a tuition-free and debt-free education for all of our students,” Natarajan said. “Our party is also dedicated to the physical and mental well-being of the students.”</p>\n<p>Natarajan also said that The Response views itself as the most progressive party.</p>\n<p>“The other two parties don’t necessary pride themselves on being very socially progressive, but The Response stands wholeheartedly behind it,” Natarajan said. “We won’t back down even if there is backlash. We truly believe in progressive ideals and believe they benefit students and all types of different students.”<br>\nPAC member and second-year history of public policy and global studies double major Nawar Nemeh said The Response challenges engrained A.S. politics.</p>\n<p>“Historically in A.S., there have been two parties that dominate the space and grapple for power, and The Response sees itself as a new alternative to the system,” Nemeh said. “We think of ourselves as representing the everyday student, representing the underrepresented students who have been marginalized and completely cut out of A.S. and have no voice.”</p>\n<p>On-campus senator, The Response member and third-year Chican@ studies and sociology double major Alejandra Melgoza said The Response’s platform is still evolving.</p>\n<p>“Our party’s platform is still being added to because we want to hear everyone’s input and we haven’t recruited enough people to get a proper proportion of the student body,” Melgoza said. “A lot of our members have worked in the past with mental health reforms, sexual assault policies and advocating for more resources for students, especially low-income students.”</p>\n<p>According to Melgoza, The Response also wants to increase representation for underrepresented communities at UCSB and bring the party members’ identities to light.</p>\n<p>“We created a new party because a lot of the party members feel that underrepresented communities have not been represented well in student government,” Melgoza said. “We can amplify those voices and build structures and build those relationships into the institution.”</p>\n<p>To learn more about The Response, visit twitter.com/TheResponseUCSB and facebook.com/The-Response-229273187412212/ or attend any of the informational sessions on Feb. 18 at 7 p.m. in the SRB, Feb. 19 at 7 p.m. in Santa Rosa Formal Lounge &amp; Santa Catalina Fiesta Room.</p>\n<h3>QUEER AND TRANS STUDENT BODY</h3>\n<p>Queer and Trans Student Body’s (QutSB) mission statement is as follows: “We, the Queer and Trans Student Body, support and affirm the diverse identities and lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, LGBTQ, two-spirit, heterosexual, and same-gender loving as individuals above all else.</p>\n<p>We strive to engage the student body in the propagation of inclusive spaces demanding greater accessibility to campus resources and taking action to end the silent epidemic of student hunger. We also acknowledge the systemic power dynamics existing in higher education are mirrored in the systematic misrepresentation of queer folk and people of color in Associated Students. We are F.I.E.R.C.E. (Food Insecurity, Inclusive Spaces, Education, Resources, Campus Climate, and Environment.)”</p>\n<p>QutSB member and fourth-year black studies and feminist studies double major Ernesto Piña said the party is running on an education-focused platform rather than a student-government-focused platform.</p>\n<p>“Instead of focusing on why you should run with our party or be in Associated Students, we are running on an education platform to make this space available to queer folk,” Piña said.</p>\n<p>Piña said QutSB differs from the other parties because of its grassroots perspective and unique, novice outlook on A.S.</p>\n<p>“If you see the current structure, every single new party that was started aside from ours were released by ex-senators or senators,” Piña said. “I believe each party has done tremendous work, but I do believe that it is a replication of stuff that has been done in the past.”<br>\nPiña said their party is focused on inclusivity.</p>\n<p>“We are inclusive to students who are interested in learning about the process of Associated Students through an education lens to realize why they should care,” Piña said. “You don’t have to be queer or trans to join our party. We are inclusive of heterosexual and cisgender individuals.”</p>\n<p>QutSB member and third-year environmental studies major Ryan Carr said QutSB wants to address forgotten issues in A.S.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to focus on issues like the silent epidemic and issues of food insecurity on our campus,” Carr said. “We feel there is a misrepresentation of queer folk in A.S., and we want to fix that.”</p>\n<p>To learn more about QutSB, visit facebook.com/qutsb/ and twitter.com/qutsb or attend their informational session on Feb. 19 at 5 p.m. in the RCSGD (third floor of the SRB).</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on pages 1,4,5,6 of the Thursday, February 18, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68383\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/overview-of-new-a-s-parties/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68383\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/overview-of-new-a-s-parties/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/overview-of-new-a-s-parties/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/overview-of-new-a-s-parties/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/overview-of-new-a-s-parties/","id":2532,"author":{"id":127,"name":"Amy Koo"},"related":[2531,2530,2529],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
