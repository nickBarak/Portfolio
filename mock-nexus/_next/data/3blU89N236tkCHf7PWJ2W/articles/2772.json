Senate extended their platforms Monday at The Hub, pointing to their own experiences and calling for unity between the oft-divided campus parties.</p>\n<p>Students can vote for A.S. elected officials starting April 23. Official slates for the 2018-19 A.S. Senate can be found here.</p>\n<p>For the most part, candidates for both Campus United (CU) and the Isla Vista Party (IVP) converged on issues at the official forum, agreeing on topics like safety in I.V., keeping tuition and student fees at a minimum and voting for Measure R, which would fund the I.V. Community Services District.</p>\n<p>There were few points of tension, but the candidates did take different approaches when it came to discussing a fee initiative that would fund a controversial University Center renovation. While IVP candidates criticized the project’s proposed use of student fees, CU’s batch of A.S. hopefuls said students themselves should be the main deciders of whether the plan is best for them.</p>\n<p>Monday’s questions, written by both A.S. Elections Board and submitted anonymously by audience members during the forum, included topics about I.V. safety, the proposed NewCen project, I.V. governance and other off-campus issues.</p>\n<p>Candidates’ responses to these questions and overarching goals are summarized below:</p>\n<p>Ashley Ng, an IVP candidate, said equipping Community Service Officers with official school vehicles would be a good way to ensure safety for I.V. residents. To CU candidate Sydney Karmes-Wainer, an off-campus CU candidate, the most important changes needed are the most visible and tangible ones, which she said take shape in facilities that need better upkeep.</p>\n<p>CU’s Amy Zhou said redrawing inefficient parking lines would be first on her agenda, while her partymate Mordi Shadpour said his main goal was making the area “very safe for everyone and welcoming to students from all walks of life.” He cited his work with UC Santa Barbara Life of the Party in promoting safer alcohol and drug use in I.V.</p>\n<p>Salvadore Hernandez Arellano of IVP noted that ramping up the use of blue lighting and decreasing police presence in I.V. would help make the community safer.</p>\n<p>CU’s Adam Chohan didn’t mention a specific action, but rather said his first line of action would be to talk to the people he’d be working to represent.</p>\n<p>Jasmine Palmerin of IVP said her main focus is to create a safer I.V. by lighting up dimmer areas and installing emergency blue lights throughout I.V. that have call buttons to contact local law enforcement. With her experience as a volunteer for the Women’s Center, she believes sexual assault hasn’t been acknowledged in I.V. and is something she will focus on as senator.</p>\n<p>IVP’s Christian Ornelas said he wants to work toward addressing the mold problem in I.V. housing. He said he will work toward getting units better ventilation by talking to landlords and opening up tenant-to-landlord communication. Ornelas supports Measure R, which would fund the CSD, in order to address tenant and landlord mediation.</p>\n<p>Dallin Mello of IVP said he will create a commission that bridges connections for student workers and the City of Santa Barbara. Mello said student workers have different needs than most students, and he hopes to build opportunities for them. In response to a question about differences in political beliefs, Mello said, “just because we don’t see eye to eye, doesn’t mean we can’t work together.”</p>\n<p>CU’s Nicole Estess hopes to work with the CSD and I.V. Foot Patrol to integrate more lighting in I.V. and work as a mediator with local law enforcement. Estess currently works in with the EVPSA office lobbying for UC funding.</p>\n<p>Alexander “Alex” Young of CU, said he will focus on I.V. and UCSB sustainability as well as opening up communication with his constituents. He said he is also in support of Measure R to fund the CSD. In response to his support for the NewCen project, Young said, “it’s up to the student themselves if their fees should be used for the UCen.”</p>\n<p>CU’s Andrew Nguyen said that creating online forums for A.S. committees will build communication between A.S. and the student body. In response to the question about the NewCen project, Nguyen said he sees that “it might be a long-term investment.”</p>\n<p>Yara Khamis of CU will strive to open up more means of communication to build “a stronger community,” especially between permanent residents of I.V. and students. She wants to improve the way sexual assault is addressed in I.V. and is a supporter of Measure R.</p>\n<p>IVP’s Ryan Clark said he wants to make Gaucho Care more inclusive and help improve the quality of parks in I.V. Clark wants to work toward making sure that sexual assault cases reach the appropriate authorities and have more students involved in community based policing.</p>\n<p>Jalia “Jolly” Carlton-Carew of IVP said she will strive to create a web-series show about Isla Vista “to craft our own narrative to tell our own story.” She believes the NewCen should not come from student fees, but that the university should allocate that funding and “we shouldn’t have to pay for things that we should already be provided.”</p>\n<p>Carla Cernat of CU wants to create more community based policing and implement restorative justice-based programs for students. She hopes to extend C.A.R.E. workshops and sexual assault training to all students, not just fraternities and sororities. Cernat also wants to increase safety in I.V. and believes she has done so already in helping create the Sun Fest, an alternative Deltopia activity for students.</p>\n<p>CU’s Zachary Zeising, sustainability chair of his fraternity, said he wants to push for safety and environmentally friendly systems in I.V. He specifically wants to install an emergency blue light system in I.V. to help create faster responses to sexual assault incidents.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

scholars, selected UC Santa Barbara mechanical engineering Professor Megan Valentine to receive a Fulbright Scholar Award on December 22, announced in a press release by UCSB on April 27.</p>\n<p>As part of the program, Valentine will research soft material sciences at ESPCI ParisTech, a physics and chemistry college, in the fall of 2015 with ESPCI ParisTech materials science professor Costantino Creton.</p>\n<p>Valentine joined the Mechanical Engineering Department in 2008, after earning a Ph.D. in physics at Harvard University and completing a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University in the Biological Sciences Department. Valentine’s studies in soft materials research focuses on how forces are generated and transmitted in living materials, and how these forces control cellular outcomes.</p>\n<p>Valentine said one goal of her research is to pave the way for women and underrepresented students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (S.T.E.M.) fields through teaching and outreach.</p>\n<p>“The outstanding record of ESPCI ParisTech in the recruitment and retention of women to S.T.E.M. fields was one of the many attractions in selecting it, and France, for my sabbatical,” Valentine said. “I hope to return to UCSB with a better understanding of how the French educational system engages and supports female students, and suggestions for how the U.S. system could be improved.”</p>\n<p>Mechanical Engineering Department Chair Francesco Bullo said Valentine’s research makes important strides in addressing problems posed in the medical field.</p>\n<p>“Dr. Valentine is an extremely productive and talented researcher,” Bullo said. “Her project, ‘Creating tough, fatigue-resistant materials, inspired by nature,’ leverages her expertise in biological systems and protein engineering while tackling important new problems in materials research, specifically bio-inspired self-healing materials.”</p>\n<p>According to Valentine, the materials in her study operate similarly to the technology in bike helmets, which employ a “controlled collapse” of a foamy core to absorb impact energy and protect our skulls.</p>\n<p>“My focus is on developing materials that can dissipate energy during loading through the controlled breakage of sacrificial bonds,” Valentine said. “This approach of toughening by weakening is not new … but the work proposed here goes further by incorporating reversible bonding schemes that allow the sacrificial bonds to reform when the load is removed, thus allowing the materials to ‘heal.’”</p>\n<p>Valentine said her research builds upon previous studies in producing improved adhesives and drug transportation vehicles, working toward a deeper understanding of the properties of living materials in synthetic systems.</p>\n<p>“I am particularly excited about biomedical applications and the development of materials for use in artificial heart valves, vascular grafts and joint repair,” Valentine said.</p>\n<p>Bullo said Valentine’s research will also allow for a continuing relationship with ESPCI ParisTech.</p>\n<p>“Her selection as a Fulbright awardee recognizes the excellence of her scholarship and her contributions to education and science,” Bullo said. “I am extremely proud of her accomplishments and look forward to the increased interactions with ESPCI ParisTech facilitated by this award.”</p>\n<p>First-year mechanical engineering major Ryan Tsukamoto said materials research can be applied to many aspects of science, engineering and biomedical processes.</p>\n<p>“I believe that investigation of living materials will provide valuable insight to not only medicine but all fields of science and engineering,” Tsukamoto said. “A better understanding of how living structures interact will definitely enhance medical diagnosis and treatment methods.”</p>\n<p>Valentine said collaborating with Creton’s research group will allow her to broaden her expertise in biomaterials and protein<br>\nmechanics.</p>\n<p>“I will also introduce the Creton group to the novel measurement tools that my group has developed for materials testing, in particular our suite of customized ‘magnetic tweezers’ tools which allow the application of very local forces to soft materials for spatially-resolved materials characterization,” Valentine said. “I also hope that my stay in Paris leads to long-term,</p>\n<p>fruitful collaborations between ESPCI and UCSB.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the Thursday, April 30, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A version of this story said “Valentine’s studies in soft materials research primarily involve the production of man-made materials”, however Valentine’s studies focus on living systems and the previous is true only for her research with the Fulbright Scholarship. The article also incorrectly stated Valentine received the award on April 27 when she was notified of her selection on December 22. The article has been updated accordingly.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62961\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/meche-professor-to-receive-award/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62961\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/meche-professor-to-receive-award/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/meche-professor-to-receive-award/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/meche-professor-to-receive-award/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/meche-professor-to-receive-award/","id":2770,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2769,2768,2767],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Patients Test Positive for Hepatitis","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"People treated at Dr. Thomashefsky’s office have tested positive for Hepatitis B, C and HIV","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2>People treated at Dr. Thomashefsky’s office have tested positive for Hepatitis B, C and HIV</h2>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Public Health Department (PHD) announced Monday that patients of Dr. Allen Thomashefsky’s medical office should be tested for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV.</p>\n<p>In November, PHD received notice of a new case of Hepatitis C in one of Thomashefsky’s patients who showed no previous risk factors. Further investigation revealed numerous infection control breeches at Thomashefsky’s office, resulting in its closure in March. As of April 26, six of Thomashefsky’s patients have tested positive for Hepatitis C out of 240 patients, five of which are believed to be new cases.</p>\n<p>According to a PHD press release, four of the six patients who tested positive for Hepatitis C received injections from Thomashefsky’s office on the same day.</p>\n<p>“The new findings released today bring new urgency to the Health Department’s recommendation that any patients of Dr. Thomashefsky get tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV,” the press release states. “People infected with hepatitis C often have no symptoms. Testing is the only way to know if a person is infected.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Often times they occur because individuals may not possess adequate knowledge on infection control practices, or sometimes because standards and modes of practice shift. Adhering to infection control practices, including injection safety, is key to safe patient care and protecting employees from infectious diseases. – PHD Disease Control &amp; Prevention Programs Director Paige Batson</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, PHD Deputy Director Susan Klein-Rothschild said PHD cannot be certain if the newly infected patients were exposed to Hepatitis C in Thomashefsky’s office until the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) completes molecular genetic testing.</p>\n<p>“We do not yet have scientific confirmation that those who have newly diagnosed Hepatitis C acquired this virus from his [Dr. Thomashefsky’s] office,” Klein-Rothschild said in an email. “We await the results of molecular genetic testing from the CDC.”</p>\n<p>Director of Student Health Dr. Mary Ferris said blood-borne viruses like Hepatitis C do not spread easily.</p>\n<p>“These diseases … they usually require a significant blood exposure such as a deep needle puncture, not just a drop of blood on intact skin,” Farris said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Disease Control &amp; Prevention Programs Director at PHD Paige Batson, infection control breaches like those found at Thomashefsky’s medical clinic happen because medical professionals are not educated in safe practices.</p>\n<p>“Often times they occur because individuals may not possess adequate knowledge on infection control practices, or sometimes because standards and modes of practice shift,” Batson said in an email. “Adhering to infection control practices, including injection safety, is key to safe patient care and protecting employees from infectious diseases.”</p>\n<p>Ferris said information explaining proper disease and infection prevention procedures is readily available to medical offices.</p>\n<p>“An entire body of scientific knowledge is available to guide us in how to minimize the risk of spreading infections through both cleaning and prevention,” Ferris said in an email. “Health professionals specialize in setting up these programs and monitoring their success.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Infection control breaches can occur at any time in a clinical practice. It is sometimes the little things that can place patients at risk from infection control breaches. – PHD Disease Control &amp; Prevention Programs Director Paige Batson</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Batson, even seemingly minor mistakes — like lapses in hand washing — in a medical office can cause infection control breaches.</p>\n<p>“Infection control breaches can occur at any time in a clinical practice,” Batson said in an email. “It is sometimes the little things that can place patients at risk from infection control breaches.”</p>\n<p>First-year electrical engineering major Millan Batra said the story of Dr. Thomashefsky’s medical office makes him wary of medical offices.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s bullshit that they would let an infectious disease run rampant like that,” Batra said. “It means there were procedural problems.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of the Thursday, April 30, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

succulents and canvases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Back the Night (TBTN) is “a forum for survivors and allies alike to make their voices heard, [and creates] an environment in which survivors of sexual violence can begin to heal,” according to the organization’s website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organization’s main goal is to raise awareness for sexual assault through “activism, advocacy, and survivor empowerment,” said Emily Umana, TBTN’s finance coordinator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Planned Parenthood, Counseling and Psychological Services and the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center set up booths during the rally to give out buttons, coloring books and further information on their respective organizations, offering help to anyone who has experienced sexual assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaker Kat Alexander, founder and chief executive officer of “Report It Girl,” a web platform aiming to give survivors of sexual assault a platform to speak out, recounted her personal experiences to the crowd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She described how being a survivor of both rape and incest impacted her life and urged the men and women at the event to be honest with themselves about the tragedies they have endured.</span></p>\n<div

said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexander spoke about the need for survivors of sexual assault to speak up about what has happened to them and about how surrounding oneself with a community of people is crucial. She explained that approaching traumatic experiences head-on instead of pushing them away is important.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanted to know that there was at least one person out there who had even remotely gone through what I had been through,” she said. “Grief is a totally appropriate response if you have experienced trauma.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexander asked the students listening to get into groups with their friends and share ways in which they were going to decide to address the negative emotions that arise within their own lives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I come from an area where [sexual assault] wasn’t talked about,” said Linnea Loeb, second-year biology major. “It’s important to have a presence so people know not only that they’re not alone, but that they have allies.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s really cool to have an organization focused on women empowerment and women acting for women,” said Layla Hernandez, a second-year English major who attended the rally.</span></p>\n<p>In an email this Saturday, Jane Diep, TBTN co-chair, said the organization prefers to emphasize intersectionality and makes efforts to be inclusive of all sexual assault and interpersonal violence, not just women, because “people of all genders experience [sexual assault].”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organization hung teal and purple bandanas around UCSB’s campus for sexual assault awareness month and in preparation for the event, according to Umana.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want this rally to increase awareness and participation to combat rape culture and interpersonal violence. We hope to have individuals inspired and understand what they are fighting for,” Umana said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to their annual spring rally, TBTN meets weekly to discuss how they can combat rape culture and make UCSB and I.V. safer for women.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article previously referred to Loeb as a TBTN member. Diep, a TBTN co-chair, has informed the Nexus that the organization’s executive board does not recognize Loeb as a member. This article now uses “survivor” to refer to people who have been sexually assaulted, where before it used “victim.”</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82615\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-20/take-back-the-night-rallies-against-sexual-assault-sets-space-for-healing/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82615\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-20/take-back-the-night-rallies-against-sexual-assault-sets-space-for-healing/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-20/take-back-the-night-rallies-against-sexual-assault-sets-space-for-healing/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-20/take-back-the-night-rallies-against-sexual-assault-sets-space-for-healing/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-20/take-back-the-night-rallies-against-sexual-assault-sets-space-for-healing/","id":2769,"author":{"id":88,"name":"Katie Wolf"},"related":[2768,2767,2766],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
