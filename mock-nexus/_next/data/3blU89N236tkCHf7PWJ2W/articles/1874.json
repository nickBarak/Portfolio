Headlining the UCSB golf team is  Zach Smith who has earned a pair of Big West Golfer of the Month awards. The junior has had five top-ten finishes, a career high for him in a single season, including him taking the individual title at the Wyoming Cowboy Classic, the first of his career.</p>\n<p>Smith is coming off a successful 2016 campaign in which he was named All-Big West Second Team and is en route to winning the 2017 Big West Golfer of the Year thanks to his wonderful 2017 run.</p>\n<p>Speaking of Big West Golfers of the Year, the Gauchos still have the 2016 recipient of that award in their arsenal as well. Brandon Bauman, a Las Vegas native, has had another strong campaign as he has had four top-ten finishes this year, including a top-ten rank in his last three matches.</p>\n<p>Bauman enters the Big West Championship with a stroke average of 72.03, second on the team to Smith’s 71.97. The junior is also only the third player in school history to win the Big West Conference individual title when he shot a 4-under par 212 in the tournament last year.</p>\n<p>The final three golfers of UCSB’s successful lineup this season consists of junior Willy Moffly, sophomore Nick Swanson and freshman Brett Bennett. Each of these golfers has enjoyed success this season as Moffly has two top-five finishes, four top ten.</p>\n<p>Swanson has three top-ten finishes including his highest rank of the season, a sixth-place finish at the Bill Collum Invite. Swanson was also a Big West Golfer of the Month recipient during the month of November. Bennett, the youngest of the trio, also has three top-ten finishes and had a third place rank at the PRO compression Invite.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s biggest competition will most likely be its green rival Cal Poly who enters the tournament with the No. 2 seed. CP and UCR are the only other teams in the Big West who claimed a tournament title this year with UCSB being the only team to take multiple titles.</p>\n<p>The Big West Tournament will be hosted by UCSB this year and will begin on Monday, May 1, at 11:30 am. The Tournament will run through Wednesday, May 3 at the Sandpiper Golf Course with Tuesday’s activities beginning at 11:30 am and the final round conclusion beginning at 7:30 am.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Recently, Kuskey placed 12 out of 42 throwers in his third regional competition at the University of Texas. The 12th-place finish was high enough for him to receive the bid to the NCAA Championships.</p>\n<p>Now, this might seem like another success story of a talented college athlete, but Kuskey’s path has been far from the norm and much more insightful.</p>\n<p>Most Division I athletes have been playing their respective sports growing up, becoming familiar with the ins and outs, learning the accompanying techniques and etiquette. Most Division I athletes also have access to a facility that is suitable for hosting competitions. Kuskey isn’t like most Division 1 athletes.</p>\n<p>Growing up in the Santa Barbara area, Kuskey attended Santa Ynez Valley Union High and graduated in 2012. Gifted athletically, Kuskey played football and basketball, and was also on varsity golf for all four years. On top of this, he was the captain of the golf team as a junior and senior. For someone who will be competing at the highest level of collegiate track in roughly a week, Kuskey’s high school athletic resume is missing something.</p>\n<p>Because track season occurred at the same time as golf season in high school, Kuskey was forced to stick with golf in the spring sports, never getting the shot to become a four-sport athlete. Being so talented at golf, Kuskey’s choice was simple: He continued playing golf, never running track.</p>\n<p>After receiving a one-year deferred admission from USC, his dream school, Kuskey decided to go to SBCC for a year before fighting on as a Trojan. However, after a year in Santa Barbara, there would be no USC Fight Song in Kuskey’s future.</p>\n<p>While at SBCC, Kuskey decided to begin training as a decathlete. Decathletes compete in four track events as well as six field events. Kuskey described his decision to pursue track, “It was always a dream of mine to play a sport in college; I was athletic in high school.” Being a three-sport athlete and then just deciding to give decathlete training a try, Kuskey is more than just “athletic.”</p>\n<p>As he was on the track at SBCC, Kuskey was spotted by someone from UCSB who saw potential in the track and field novice — so much potential, in fact, that Kuskey was convinced to come to UCSB for track and field as a freshman.</p>\n<p>The javelin emerged as Kuskey’s specialty, and all of a sudden, after having never run a day of track in high school, Kuskey was competing at his first NCAA regionals in Austin, Texas, as a sophomore.</p>\n<p>“It was really unexpected, actually, [but] I’ve always sort of been a really competitive type and never really liked the feeling of being bad at something,” Kuskey said. “It’s obviously a lot of work and javelin is a very technical event. It took a lot of endurance.”</p>\n<p>The mindset and practice from succeeding in multiple other sports helped Kuskey just as much as his natural athleticism. Without the discipline and ability to ignore distractions, he wouldn’t be where he is today.</p>\n<p>“Being in a D1 program for the past four years has taught me a lot about time management, at times doing more track than school, double days — everybody does it on the team,” Kuskey said.</p>\n<p>The hard work and dedication has clearly paid off for Kuskey, but perhaps more rewarding have been the experience of being involved with track in college. While there are plans for the renovation of the UCSB track, the well-known poor condition of the track has been bringing the team together.</p>\n<p>“The fact that we’re the underdogs sort of unites us. The track team is pretty close, we’re all pretty good friends. We use that underdog mentality to our benefit,” Kuskey said. “It’s pretty cool [when you see a] 250-pound thrower is cheering on the distance runners, and you can feel the energy; everyone feeds off each other.”</p>\n<p>This attitude and environment of track has clearly driven Kuskey to thrive in the sport, but Kuskey isn’t slowing down anytime soon.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, Kuskey is succeeding in more than just sports. He is graduating at the end of this quarter with a degree in political science with an emphasis in international relations, and he’s already been commuting two days a week to Manhattan Beach for an internship in sports marketing.</p>\n<p>Kuskey credits his all-around success to his involvement and experience in sports. “Being an athlete and being on track has prepared me for a work environment, and employers know that.”</p>\n<p>While it may seem reasonable for a graduating senior to be stressed with so much going on, Kuskey is extremely calm and ready for everything to come. Ubiquitous questions of jobs, places to stay and graduation photos have of course been evident this spring for seniors, but Kuskey has had to juggle his track postseason on top of all this.</p>\n<p>Thinking about his life after graduation, Kuskey did manage to crack a joke: “It’ll be pretty interesting for the first time in my life without having 8 a.m. workouts.”</p>\n<p>He’s had to travel to Austin, Texas, and now he’s planning his trip to Eugene, Ore. Having a conversation with Kuskey, you’d never know how much he has on his plate due to his composed nature. The top-24 javelin thrower in the country humbly discussed only some of his achievements, but he won both the Big West Championship and the UCLA-hosted Pac 12 Invitational this year in addition to qualifying for the NCAA Track and Field Championships.</p>\n<p>Traveling to Eugene this year is well-deserved for Kuskey, as he competed in regionals for the third time this year, but he is barely shaken by the intensity of where he’ll be next week on June 8.</p>\n<p>“I’m a little bit nervous. I try not to think about it too much; I’ve been training for this for four years,” Kuskey said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78427\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/no-prior-experience-necessary-matt-kuskeys-unique-journey-to-the-ncaa-finals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78427\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/no-prior-experience-necessary-matt-kuskeys-unique-journey-to-the-ncaa-finals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/no-prior-experience-necessary-matt-kuskeys-unique-journey-to-the-ncaa-finals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/no-prior-experience-necessary-matt-kuskeys-unique-journey-to-the-ncaa-finals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/no-prior-experience-necessary-matt-kuskeys-unique-journey-to-the-ncaa-finals/","id":1871,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[1870,1869,1868],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stay Woke!

I guess you can say I simply wrote from my heart because it’s just so saddening that a little over a year later, I find myself expressing similar sentiments to the Colin Kaepernick article I wrote. The former NFL quarterback’s initial call to action was his decision to sit on the bench during the National Anthem prior to electing to kneel in future games.</p>\n<p>The purpose of Kaepernick’s protest was to combat racial inequality and social injustice, as he stated, “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.”</p>\n<p>On Friday, Sept. 22, at a rally for Alabama Republican Senate candidate Luther Strange, President Donald Trump suggested that NFL owners should demand to “Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’’ in reference to players who have selected to kneel and protest during the anthem.</p>\n<p>As various players responded to his claims via social media, voicing their indifferences and unsurprised reactions, Trump followed up with a series of tweets days after the rally, generally stating that sports fans and this country will not condone players protesting the flag.</p>\n<p>As both a black man and a sports fan, Trump’s statements were no surprise to me as well.</p>\n<p>Although I am disappointed and sickened by such remarks, I feel like I’ve become numb to hearing such irrational and hate-filled words. It’s expected, especially when considering the fact that Trump and others who believe that players are disrespecting the flag do not see the bigger issue at hand.</p>\n<p>The larger issue at hand is that black people and people of color are not treated equally in this country. Nonetheless, this racial inequality isn’t being acknowledged but rather minimized by being framed as a threat to America and its flag.</p>\n<p>For people to mistake Kaepernick’s protest as being aimed at disrespecting the flag or military goes to show why movements such as Black Lives Matter are so relevant, especially as I witness people get more upset over athletes deciding to peacefully protest rather than the innocent lives that are taken on a yearly basis.</p>\n<p>It’s crazy to think how quick fans are to forgive and forget a player’s troubles with domestic violence, substance abuse violations or performance enhancement violations. While I do believe in second chances for certain circumstances, even for the aforementioned cases, to an extent, the fact that race is viewed as a topic that does not belong in connection to sports is ludicrous.</p>\n<p>It is time for us all to wake up!</p>\n<p>No, I do not have a specific solution to end racial inequality. But I do believe that the first step toward making progress begins with acknowledging and combating racism in order to overcome the taboo nature that has made it such a cringe-worthy topic.</p>\n<p>Doing so means that systemic ideologies such as colorblindness, in which we’ve been told that race and skin color don’t matter or that we live in a meritocratic society where everyone is on a level playing field and must put in the work to reach a certain level of so-called “success,” are things that must be stripped of their manipulative powers.</p>\n<p>Excuses that athletes need to “stick to sports” because of the amount of money they make and other claims that discredit today’s protests are just detractors from working towards unity.</p>\n<p>This is why I remain so proud of the NFL athletes who genuinely took a knee or protested in another manner this past Sunday. While I don’t believe that all players who demonstrated a protest were sincere, such actions were significant because, although immediate results will not show, an impact is still gradually being made.</p>\n<p>Whether it ever reaches him or not, I just want to say thank you to Colin Kaepernick for protesting and setting the precedent for what exists today in providing a voice for the voiceless concerning racial inequality. He wasn’t the first and he won’t be the last, but his impact is profound and will last forever.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, my mood is precisely expressed by Detroit Lions’ tight end Eric Ebron:</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_78874\" style=\"width: 619px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/?attachment_id=78874\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-78874\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78874\" data-attachment-id=\"78874\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/stay-woke-but-stay-in-your-own-league/screen-shot-2017-09-27-at-9-28-40-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?fit=1288%2C618&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1288,618\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2017-09-27 at 9.28.40 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?fit=250%2C120&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?fit=888%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-78874\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM-1024x491.png?resize=609%2C292\" alt=\"\" width=\"609\" height=\"292\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?resize=1024%2C491&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?resize=250%2C120&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?resize=768%2C368&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?w=1288&amp;ssl=1 1288w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 609px) 100vw, 609px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78874\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tweet Courtesy of Eric Ebron, @Ebron85</p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>But this time around the experience is different. While no executive order has been implemented, the same oppressive nature is being reproduced by Trump’s attempt to silence the voices of NFL players who are currently protesting social injustice, racial inequality and Trump’s objective to have them taken off the field for protesting as his tweets suggest.</p>\n<p>The recent NFL events that have taken place this week display an attempt to force “athletes to stick to sports.”</p>\n<p>Supporting such a message have been the actions of the world’s 12th and 19th richest sports team owners: Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross and the leader of ‘America’s Team,’ the Dallas Cowboys, owner Jerry Jones.</p>\n<p>Prior to the kickoff of the Dolphins’ Week Five matchup vs the Tennessee Titans, Ross spoke about his stance on player protest and the impact he believes Trump has had, claiming that the President has “changed that whole paradigm of what protest is. And I think it’s incumbent upon the players today, because of how the public is looking at it, to really stand and really salute the flag,” per the <em>SunSentiel’s </em>Chris Perkins.</p>\n<p>Jones spoke with no filter, expressing his expectations that, “If there is anything disrespecting the flag, then we will not play. Period. We’re going to respect the flag and I’m going to create the perception of it,” according to Brandon George of the <em>Dallas Morning News, </em>via <em>CBSsports’ </em>Sean Wagner-McGough. The Cowboys owner said such remarks after kneeling with his team in unison the previous week prior to the national anthem being sang, then locked arms with players as they all stood during its performance.</p>\n<p>The sudden change of heart occurs after Jones admitted to having a recent phone call with Trump, claiming that the President was the one to remind him of the league’s Game Operations Manual policy. A policy that doesn’t require but rather suggests that players should stand for the anthem. Jones is also one of eight known owners that donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee.</p>\n<p>Per Kurt Badenhausen, “Nineteen NFL teams are owned by billionaires, led by [Paul] Allen, Shahid Khan ($8.2 billion) of the Jacksonville Jaguars and [Stanley] Kroenke, who also owns the recently relocated Los Angeles Rams. The explosion in NFL values has produced more billionaires than any other league with eight people in the 10-figure net worth club as result of the value of their NFL franchises” (<em>Forbes, </em>March 20, 2017).</p>\n<p>Why state such statistics that seem to have no relevance regarding what either of the aforementioned owners said?</p>\n<p>Because it’s time to flip the narrative, just like they and Trump have.</p>\n<p>For those individuals opposed to NFL players protesting because of their millionaire status, why aren’t team owners with billions of dollars being chastised for “not sticking to sports” as well?</p>\n<p>Critics of the protests have yet to realize that a majority of these owners actually care about avoiding controversy more than respecting the flag in order to sustain one thing: monetary revenue.</p>\n<p>A happy consumer equals more money. Not to mention, a happy sponsor equals more money.</p>\n<p>Jones’ statement included a term that is the tell all of what trying to dissuade players from protesting is really about – “perception.”</p>\n<p>Thus far, an array of individuals, media outlets and fans have fallen victim to the misconception of NFL players protesting the flag.</p>\n<p>Constructing such a misinterpretation has been White America’s ability to manipulate the media.</p>\n<p>Take Vice President Mike Pence, for example, and his latest publicity stunt in which he shortly attended the Indianapolis Colts-San Francisco 49ers game only to depart following the choice of about 20 San Francisco players to kneel during the performance of the national anthem.</p>\n<p>Tweeting his way to glory was Trump, who claims he asked Pence to leave the game if any players kneeled. Pence listened. He also tweeted about his exit.</p>\n<p>His decision to leave will continue to be perceived as staged due to the fact that anyone attending or watching the game knew that player protests were going to take place, and rightfully so.</p>\n<p>Since day one, the primary issue at hand is white supremacists believing they have the right to dictate how black people and other people of color should feel in response to the oppression they endure.</p>\n<p>Don’t believe it? Mike Ditka’s words prove it as he now tries to apologize for claiming that “there has been no oppression in the last 100 years that I know of.”</p>\n<p>A usual belief of those who feel the flag is being disrespected is that the select players choosing to protest are not appreciating its history and the lives of those who have sacrificed for our country.</p>\n<p>It is a false notion which was never these players purpose as individuals of all skin colors have expressed themselves and protested against inequality.</p>\n<p>Imagine how it feels for someone to just ignore the history, both before and after, of an era such as the Civil Rights Movement with a claim like Ditka did.</p>\n<p>This isn’t anything new, though. It dates back to slavery. But speaking to the sports activism currently taking place, beginning with Colin Kaepernick’s decision to protest racial and social injustice and going to the present moment with voices like Jemele Hill and NFL players that have spoken up: shutting them out? It’s blatantly wrong.</p>\n<p>With no backbone to support such wrongdoing, as Goodell has come out and denounced the player protest while also announcing that he will meet with the league’s owners next week, overcoming being silenced by executive power both internally and externally is becoming an even more challenging feat.</p>\n<p>“The current dispute over the National Anthem is threatening to erode the unifying power of our game, and is now dividing us, and our players, from many fans across the country,” Goodell said on Tuesday in his call for protests to end.</p>\n<p>The cycle is full circle as both America and the NFL attempt to ignore the realities of social and racial inequality – the real threats that are dividing our nation.</p>\n<p>Presently, much uncertainty revolves around whether or not players will continue to protests, especially for those in Dallas facing the ultimatum of being benched.</p>\n<p>As the powerful words of Assata Shakur say, “We have nothing to lose but our chains.”</p>\n<p>Inequality has been one of the most oppressive “executive powers.” While always prevalent, conversation of its reality continues to reach its peak within sports. Something that was needed.</p>\n<p>Today, the fight for equality continues.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Oct. 12, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79086\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/power-plays-trump-and-the-nfls-attempt-to-silence-protest-wont-work/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79086\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/power-plays-trump-and-the-nfls-attempt-to-silence-protest-wont-work/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/power-plays-trump-and-the-nfls-attempt-to-silence-protest-wont-work/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/power-plays-trump-and-the-nfls-attempt-to-silence-protest-wont-work/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/power-plays-trump-and-the-nfls-attempt-to-silence-protest-wont-work/","id":1873,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1872,1871,1870],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
