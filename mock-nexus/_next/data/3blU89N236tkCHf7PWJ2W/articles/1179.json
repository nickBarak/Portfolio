However the Gauchos cut the lead in the top of the fifth when freshman shortstop Melanie Menor hit an RBI double into left center, bringing home junior outfielder Jacqueline Hinjosa.</p>\n<p>The Titans answered back in the bottom of the fifth with another unearned run on a sacrifice fly and the Titans shut down the UCSB attack the rest of the way.</p>\n<p>In the game, Menor went 2-3 with an RBI and a double. Hinojosa went 1-3 at the plate with a run scored.</p>\n<p>In Saturday’s first game, the Gauchos played good softball; they came back from a 3-0 deficit to claim a 4-3 victory, scoring two runs in the third and another in the fifth to tie the score at three.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos took the lead for good in the seventh on a clutch homer with two outs in the inning by Menor.</p>\n<p>Menor was 2-4 on the day with two RBIs and a run scored. Arianna Palomares had a good day as she went 1-3 with two RBI’s. DP Jessica Tetzlaff went 1-2 with two runs scored, while right fielder Jessica Johnston collected two hits and a stolen base.</p>\n<p>Senior Ashley Ludlow started the game for the Gauchos, but lasted only 1.1 innings, giving up three runs (two earned) on three hits and a walk.</p>\n<p>Freshman Veronika Gulvin came on in the second and pitched the final 5.2 innings for the win, giving up no runs and six hits while striking out one. It was big day for Gulvin, as she picked up her eighth win of the season, which is very impressive for such a young pitcher.</p>\n<p>Hoping to extend their winning streak in the second game of Saturday’s double header, the Gauchos were unable to show up with the same intensity and lost to the Titans 7-1 in the season finale.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB was the first to get a run on the board when Clark singled and scored on a throwing error, the Titans tied the score in the bottom of the first and blew it open with four more runs in the second.</p>\n<p>The Titans went on to score two more runs in the game, one in the third and another in the sixth.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos could only manage three hits in the game off a trio of Titan pitchers, and Titan reliever Christina Washington pitched two innings to pick up her third win of the season.</p>\n<p>Gaucho pitcher Veronika Gulvin took the loss, giving up five runs on four hits, including two home runs. At the plate for the Gauchos, Clark went 1-4 on the day with a run scored. Tetzlaff and catcher Samantha Stark each went 1-3.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos couldn’t end the season the way they would have liked, they fought hard in every game, never gave up and played with heart. These are traits this team is highly known for and is something that they will no doubt build upon for next year.</p>\n<p>However, this year may not be over as UCSB still has a slight chance to make an appearance in the NCAA tournament. Regardless, this team’s efforts in the 2015-2016 season deserve to be applauded.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71036\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-16/gauchos-lose-final-series-of-regular-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71036\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-16/gauchos-lose-final-series-of-regular-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-16/gauchos-lose-final-series-of-regular-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-16/gauchos-lose-final-series-of-regular-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-16/gauchos-lose-final-series-of-regular-season/","id":1179,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1178,1177,1176],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird","biography":"Not available","articles":[48,49,50,51,59,60,62,63,1118,1120,1123,1137,1138,1139,1140,1141,1142,1143,1144,1145,1148,1150,1176,1177,1178,1179,1183,1403,1406,1407,1410,1419,1421,1425,1426,1434,1436,1437,1444,1445,1447,1448,1449,1450,1451,1452,1455,1490,1494,1927,1928],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Batter Up!

Clark ended the 2014 season leading in almost every offensive category, finishing with 25 stolen bases, four triples and a .505 slugging percentage. These incredible numbers would earn her Big West Freshman of the Year, First Team-All Big West and Honorable Mention All-Pacific Region.</p>\n<p>Clark began playing softball at the early age of six when her parents signed her up for tee-ball. Her interest in softball was sparked through her older sister, whom she watched play for a year before deciding to pick up the bat herself.</p>\n<p>While Clark’s older sister provided an inspiration for her growing up, she also admired watching pro baseball players, as baseball is one of her favorite sports to watch. There is one player in particular however, who really stands out to Clark.</p>\n<p>“I really admire Adrian Beltre. I grew up as a Dodgers fan back when he was playing for the Dodgers, and I liked the way he would just take a hack,” Clark said.</p>\n<p>Taking a hack would be the motto for Clark as she improved her batting average from a .407 to .438 percentage by the end of her high school career at Monte Vista High School. Before attending Monte Vista High, Clark attended The Woodlands High in Woodlands, Texas where she would have a freshman season much like the one that she would experience later at UCSB.</p>\n<p>While only a freshman in high school, Clark led her team to a district title and was named the district’s Freshman of the Year. She also earned herself a spot on the district’s all-first team and all-academic team.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70636\" style=\"width: 243px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70636\" data-attachment-id=\"70636\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/batter-up-clark-swings-her-way-to-success/feat-softball_vsgeorgiatech-20160227-dustinharris-6-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FEAT-Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-DustinHarris-6-web.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"FEAT-Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-DustinHarris-6-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FEAT-Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-DustinHarris-6-web.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FEAT-Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-DustinHarris-6-web.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-70636\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FEAT-Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-DustinHarris-6-web.jpg?resize=233%2C350\" alt=\"After bunting the ball, Kristen Clark prepares to run to first base.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Although softball plays a huge part in Clark’s life, academics have always been a priority. Clark was an honor roll student during all four years of high school, while also being a member of the National Honors Society, the California Scholarship Federation and the French Honors Society. Fortunately, Clark ended up at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“There were a lot of factors that made me choose UC Santa Barbara. Academics was a big thing as well as the athletics part, because I’m a biology major and they obviously have a great program here,” Clark said. “There was a time when I wanted to stop by the campus and look at it, and I got a gut feeling like, ‘wow, I can see myself being here for four years,’ because it’s gorgeous, and I really liked all the coaches in the program.”</p>\n<p>Since making the decision to attend UCSB, Clark has experienced nothing but success on the softball field. In her sophomore year during the 2015 season, Clark was named Second Team All-Big West, tallying the third-most hits in Gaucho history and leading the team with 69.</p>\n<p>Clark also finished the season with a team high nine stolen bases. Throughout conference play, Clark improved her batting average from a .356 to .382 which ranked her sixth in the league.</p>\n<p>Clark’s ability and determination to improve, whether it’s small or large improvements, is at the precipice of her game. Since the beginning of her high school career, Clark has managed to better her softball abilities and improve her game.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always been more of a get on base type of batter,” Clark explained. “And so this past year I’ve really tried to get a bit more power. Against Riverside I hit an over the fence home run so that was a big step for my hitting and offense.”</p>\n<p>Setting such high goals for herself has developed Clark into one of the team’s strongest and most powerful hitters. This year Clark has continued to dominate most offensive categories, leading the team with a .420 batting average, ranking her third in the conference, and an excellent .480 on base percentage.</p>\n<p>She also leads the Gauchos with 37 runs scored this season, and 17 stolen bases, ranking her seventh in conference standings. Since the beginning of Clark’s softball career at UCSB, Clark has inspired her teammates with not only her numbers at the plate, but her drive and determination to succeed both on and off the field. As a junior, she will have huge expectations put on her by the team for her next year.  There is little doubt that Kristen Clark will be ready to meet the challenge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 5, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70650\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/batter-up-clark-swings-her-way-to-success/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70650\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/batter-up-clark-swings-her-way-to-success/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/batter-up-clark-swings-her-way-to-success/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/batter-up-clark-swings-her-way-to-success/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/batter-up-clark-swings-her-way-to-success/","id":1176,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1175,1174,1173],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Sweep Aggies in Penultimate Weekend of Regular Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Softball_vsHawaii-20160430-DustinHarris-6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Softball_vsHawaii-20160430-DustinHarris-6-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB was able to sweep conference opponent UC Davis improving its overall record to above .500 now at 27-26.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB softball team is looking to finish its season strong after completing a sweep on Sunday afternoon against the UC Davis Aggies.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70757\" style=\"width: 359px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70757\" data-attachment-id=\"70757\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/gauchos-sweep-aggies-in-penultimate-weekend-of-regular-season/ashley-wright-winds-up-to-throw-a-strike-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Softball_vsHawaii-20160430-DustinHarris-6-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Ashley Wright winds up to throw a strike.

Multiple Gauchos had big hits including senior catcher Samantha Stark and freshman infielder Sierra Altmeyer who each had a home run.</p>\n<p>Stark went 2-2 on the day with two RBIs and two runs scored. She also walked twice and was on base four times. Altmeyer also went 2-2 with a triple to go along with her home run. She had three RBIs on the day with a run scored.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer’s home run in the second inning put the first run on the board for the Gauchos, setting the tone for the remainder of the game as they scored in the second, third, fifth and seventh innings.</p>\n<p>As a freshman, Altmeyer has had an incredible season so far, as she leads the team in multiple offensive categories and is second in the Big West conference with 41 runs batted in.</p>\n<p>Senior pitcher Ashley Ludlow saw herself a day, as she earned her 10th win this season allowing only four hits and just one earned run in four innings.</p>\n<p>However, the Aggies made her work, for Ludlow threw 106 pitches in the game, striking out three and walking five.</p>\n<p>In the second game of the day, the Gauchos broke out with three big runs in the first inning on three hits, highlighted by RBI singles from Stark and Altmeyer and a sacrifice fly from sophomore right fielder Jessica Johnston.</p>\n<p>Both teams went scoreless until the fifth when the Aggies tied the score on a one-out three-run homer from junior catcher Katie Robertson.</p>\n<p>Then in the fifth, the Gauchos took the lead for good when junior infielder Emily Brucelas homered to lead off the inning, putting the Gauchos ahead by one.</p>\n<p>In the top of the seventh, Altmeyer added some insurance with her second homer of the day — a blast to deep left centerfield — putting the score at 5-3.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, that was the winning run as the Aggies rallied for a run in the bottom of the seventh but came up short as they lost 5-4.</p>\n<p>Freshman pitcher Ashley Wright started the game for the Gauchos and pitched five innings for her third win of the season.</p>\n<p>She gave up four hits and three earned runs while striking out two. Ludlow came on in the sixth to close out the game and only allowed one hit.</p>\n<p>In the third game on Sunday, UCSB banged out 13 hits to help seal the sweep the Aggies with a 6-4 victory. Johnston went 3-4 on the day, while junior outfielder Kristen Clark, Altmeyer, Brucelas and Stark each collected two hits apiece.</p>\n<p>Ludlow started the game for the Gauchos, giving up two earned runs on six hits in four innings, while striking out four and walking two.</p>\n<p>Wright came on in the fifth to pick up her fourth win of the season and freshman pitcher Veronika Gulvin closed out the game with 1.2 innings of relief to pick up her first save this year.</p>\n<p>UCSB will prepare to face Cal State Fullerton next weekend for its final series of the regular season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70846\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/gauchos-sweep-aggies-in-penultimate-weekend-of-regular-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70846\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/gauchos-sweep-aggies-in-penultimate-weekend-of-regular-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/gauchos-sweep-aggies-in-penultimate-weekend-of-regular-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/gauchos-sweep-aggies-in-penultimate-weekend-of-regular-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/gauchos-sweep-aggies-in-penultimate-weekend-of-regular-season/","id":1177,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1176,1175,1174],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Closes Season Against Big West Frontrunner","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-15-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-15-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos face-off against the top team in the Big West, Cal State Fulerton, to end the regular season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Preparing to enter its final regular season series, the UCSB softball team will be on the road to face Big West regular season champion Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70852\" style=\"width: 348px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70852\" data-attachment-id=\"70852\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/ucsb-closes-season-against-big-west-frontrunner/jessica-johnston-swings-at-a-perfect-pitch-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-15-web.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Jessica Johnston swings at a perfect pitch.

The Titans have scored 281 runs this season, and have an on base percentage of .381 and a slugging percentage of .441.</p>\n<p>Helping hold down the Titans’ infield defense is senior infielder Missy Taukeiho, who owns current team-highs in batting average at .362 and runs scored with 48. Taukeiho also leads in RBIs with a total of 34. She will be a huge threat at the plate with her powerful swing and speed. She also carries a solid on base percentage of .495 and a slugging percentage of .678.</p>\n<p>Titan sophomore outfielder Samantha Vandiver is another top tier hitter in Fullerton’s batting lineup with a .333 average. Vandiver has scored 44 runs this season, a .378 on base percentage and a slugging percentage of .383.</p>\n<p>The Titans also have a strong pitching staff, led by their two starting pitchers, senior Desiree Ybarra and freshman Sydney Golden. Together, the two have given up only 66 earned runs in 262.2 innings pitched. Ybarra has been stellar with an outstanding ERA of 1.84 with 127 strikeouts in 144.1 innings.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos will look to challenge each pitchers’ aim within the strike zone with hitters of their own.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s .307 hitting clip narrowly edges the Titans’ .303 batting average, the Gauchos may be able to overpower the Titans with players such as junior outfielder Kristen Clark and sophomore outfielder Jessica Johnston.</p>\n<p>The team’s top two contributors most recently, Clark will begin the weekend with an on-base percentage of .471 and a slugging percentage of .462. Johnston also has good numbers with a .417 on base percentage and a .439 slugging percentage.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, senior infielder Arianna Palomares has made her way to the top of the lineup with her 30 runs scored and 35 RBIs this season.
