Eric Swenson/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>A successful pair of games on the road last weekend has made the UCSB men’s soccer team one of only two teams in the Big West to start a perfect 2-0 in conference play. This weekend, the Gauchos return home to welcome UC Riverside and the only other 2-0 team in Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>“It was a great weekend playing what I think are two really tough teams on the road,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “But, as we know, last weekend doesn’t matter if we don’t take care of this weekend. We have to continue doing what we’ve been doing over the past four weeks now and find a way to win conference games.”</p>\n<p>A three-game win streak has brought UCSB’s record to 7-3-1 overall and 2-0 in conference, giving it sole possession of first place in the Big West North. The Highlanders come to town at 5-5-1 overall and 1-1 in the Big West. The Titans, currently at 7-4 overall, 2-0 Big West and in first place in the South, will arrive on Saturday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For the Gauchos, every week has seemed to tell the same story for quite some time. The name of that story? Nick DePuy.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s offensive front man has so many scoring streaks and statistical anomalies going for him right now, it’s hard to keep track. With a brace in his last game and three goals in the conference’s opening weekend, DePuy earned his second career National Player of the Week award and second consecutive Big West Offensive Player of the Week.</p>\n<p>“What he’s doing right now is really remarkable,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s been one of the best runs we’ve had out of any forward. One of the huge advantages this year is he’s got players around him that can give him the ball. We have players around him that are dangerous and that can score, so that means [the defense] can’t really concentrate all their energies on one player.”</p>\n<p>The junior has now scored in three consecutive games, giving him a Big West leading total of 10 through just 11 games, which matches his 2014 total. Since moving to forward from the midfield last year, he has compiled 19 goals in 24 games. In UCSB’s 15 wins during that stretch, DePuy has scored 11 game-winners. His total of five game-winners in 2015 has him in the top five in the nation.</p>\n<p>Backing him up on the offensive front has been a pair of first-year Gaucho forwards in sophomore Ahinga Selemani and freshman Geoffrey Acheampong. Selemani has 34 shots to his name this season, good for second in the Big West behind DePuy’s 38 and is second on the team with three goals and eight points. Acheampong is currently tied for first in the conference with four assists to go along with two goals of his own to match Selemani with eight points.</p>\n<p>On the defensive side, goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg has been strong in the net for the Gauchos. The freshman ranks fourth in conference with a .99 goals against average that has given him an excellent record of 7-2 through his first nine career starts.</p>\n<p>As a team, the Gauchos are undefeated in their last seven conference games dating back to last season, excluding the postseason. They are off to a 2-0 start for the second consecutive season.</p>\n<p>Last year, the Gauchos nearly missed out on the No. 1 seed after going winless in their first three conference road games, but they pulled together to either win or tie their last five games to clinch home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. With their first two conference wins of 2015 coming on the road, they are in excellent shape to earn a No. 1 seed in the Big West Tournament for the third-straight season.</p>\n<p>UCR travels to Harder Stadium today hoping it can win, or at least repeat the result it managed against the Gauchos last year. Playing on their home turf, the Highlanders frustrated and held UCSB to a 1-1 tie through 120 minutes. Playing at Harder Stadium this time around, Santa Barbara can expect a much different result.</p>\n<p>“If they come out trying to frustrate us, we’ve just got to give it right back to them,” freshman defender Sam Strong said. “We’ve just got to frustrate them more. Those are my type of games, so I’m excited.”</p>\n<p>Riverside possesses the conference’s second-best goal-scorer of the year in Norberto Ochoa. The redshirt senior forward has notched seven scores thus far, helping UCR to a third-best ranking in the Big West with 18 as a team. This is a big improvement compared to last season when the Highlanders managed just 21 all season.</p>\n<p>CSUF comes to town on Saturday coming off a game at Cal Poly tonight. If both the Titans and the Gauchos come away victorious tonight, then Saturday’s match will be a battle between the only two teams in the Big West to start 3-0.</p>\n<p>“What Fullerton has done in each of their games is kind of hung on, frustrated the other team and then found a way to score a goal,” Vom Steeg said. “I don’t think they’re going to come here with any intentions of running up and down the field with us. I think they’re going to try to maintain a good defense, put lots of players behind the ball and see if they can get something on a set piece or a breakout.”</p>\n<p>The Titans are led on offense by sophomore midfielder Diego Sanchez, who has five goals this season, and freshman forward Brandon West who has tallied three assists. Both marks are good for third best in the conference.</p>\n<p>Fullerton has been especially good on the defensive side since the start of September, earning six shutouts in its last nine games. The Titans rank second in the conference in goals against average, allowing just .91 goals per game, compared to UCSB’s third-best mark of 1.15.</p>\n<p>Junior defender Zach Bryan was largely responsible for the team’s great start to conference, leading the defense in last weekend’s 2-0 and 1-0 wins over Sacramento State and UC Davis, respectively. His efforts earned him the first Big West Defensive Player of the Week honors of the conference season and the first of his career.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will still be without junior left back Ismaila Jome, who has missed the last five games with an ankle injury. After trying to play through an injury since spring, junior midfielder Drew Murphy has been ruled out for the season after deciding to have surgery on his ankle.</p>\n<p>UCSB is set to take on UCR at 7 p.m. tonight at Harder Stadium before hosting CSUF on Saturday at the same time.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65099\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/ucsb-reaching-peak-with-undefeated-conf-start/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65099\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/ucsb-reaching-peak-with-undefeated-conf-start/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/ucsb-reaching-peak-with-undefeated-conf-start/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/ucsb-reaching-peak-with-undefeated-conf-start/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/ucsb-reaching-peak-with-undefeated-conf-start/","id":1508,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1507,1506,1505],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson","biography":"Not available","articles":[121,137,246,247,249,250,342,355,358,359,360,377,378,380,384,386,390,394,397,399,400,404,405,413,415,417,418,421,428,432,435,436,438,443,445,459,460,462,463,464,466,469,475,477,480,482,483,486,495,497,498,499,500,501,505,545,599,843,967,968,971,982,984,985,986,987,988,989,990,991,992,993,994,995,1016,1017,1019,1020,1021,1023,1024,1025,1107,1147,1173,1198,1400,1462,1463,1464,1469,1470,1471,1472,1474,1476,1477,1478,1481,1482,1483,1485,1486,1487,1495,1498,1501,1502,1504,1507,1508,1509,1510,1511,1514,1516,1517,1519,1521,1523,1525,1533,1534,1535,1536,1537,1538,1543,1544,1545,1546,1547,1548,1551,1552,1553,1556,1557,1559,1985,1994,1999,2028,2033,2039,2066,3210,3219,3230,3241,3258,3285,3289,3291,3295,5051,5065,5067,5078,5083,5084,5086,5087,5090,5091,5092,5093,5094,5095,5096,5099,5100,5243,5262,5276,5277,5278,5279,5280,5281,5282,5283,5284,5285,5286,5288,5293,5305,5306,5308,5309,5312,5313],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Women’s Soccer Opens Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo3-web1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo3-web1.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"Following a controlled 1-0 victory against Pacific, the UCSB women’s soccer team tops off their first Big West match of the year with a one-game road trip to 3-6-1 University of Hawaii.

The Gauchos were on a two-game losing skid after dropping matches against CSU Northridge and Long Beach before clinching their first conference win at home against none other than the Rainbow Wahine. Despite a rough start to last season Stumpf is very optimistic for this young team along with valuable veterans such as Amanda Ball and Savannah Francis coming back into the lineup.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s going to be nice to have a deeper bench and more experience in our group specifically from Amanda and Savannah, Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Ball and Francis will be a tremendous boost to Santa Barbara’s already-sharp rotation. As a freshman, Ball started seven matches at forward for her team racking up two goals in her first two home appearances against Cleveland State and Southern Utah. Adding some well needed offensive experience, Ball will mesh well in that front line with freshman forward Mallory Hromatko and junior midfielder Sara Feder. Ball has not seen action since UCSB’s double-OT tie against San Jose State on August 28th.</p>\n<p>Heading into her senior year, Savannah Francis will likely be a primary leader both on offense and defense for UCSB. The La Mirada, CA native was on the field in all 19 matches for her team, starting 16 of them. Francis finished the season with two goals and one assist, ironically being Amanda Ball’s first career goal against the Vikings. A gruesome foot injury has sidelined Francis for 13 games this season.</p>\n<p>“These players coming back will likely see some minutes off the bench [this Thursday],” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have some assignments to be aware of as they face a Rainbow Wahine team coming off a 2-0 victory at home against Brigham Young University. Sophomore Dani Crawford looks to carry the load for Hawaii leading the team with three goals and six points at the forward position. This will be a big matchup for defenders Ryan Kokoska and Sydney Fuertes to slow Crawford down and lower her scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>Stumpf is not only optimistic in his team’s play this weekend but also how Rainbow Wahine Stadium will fit their mode of play.</p>\n<p>“[Rainbow Wahine Stadium] is quite nice. It’s big, flat, fast, and suits the style of soccer we want to play,” said Stumpf.</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to the big island this Thursday for a 10 p.m. pacific time match against Hawaii.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of October 1, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/wsoc-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/wsoc-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/wsoc-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/wsoc-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/wsoc-2/","id":1505,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1504,1503,1502],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Two of Big West’s Best Face Off at Harder Stadium","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo13-web.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"UCSB women's soccer has won eight of its last nine matches.

Coming off a 1-0 victory against arguably the top team in the conference in Cal State Fullerton, this match will be essential for the Gauchos to prove they are a side to be reckoned with in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Last week’s matchup against the Rainbow Wahine was everything UCSB needed to start its conference play on a good note. Following a stagnant first half that featured one shot on goal, Santa Barbara tallied the first score of the game in the 72nd minute as sophomore forward Amanda Ball earned a penalty kick that she took herself, launching it into the back of the net. This was Ball’s first official goal of the season after missing the Gauchos’ previous eight matches due to injury.</p>\n<p>After Ball’s score, it didn’t take long for UCSB to follow up with another as freshman forward Jessica Parque drove down the left line and sank a shot past Wahine junior goalkeeper Monk Berger, extending her team’s lead to 2-0. A goal in the 86th minute by other freshman forward Mallory Hromatko wrapped things up for the Gauchos, handing them their first conference win of the season with a final score of 3-0.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<div id=\"attachment_65038\" style=\"width: 401px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo13-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"922935573\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65111\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65038\" data-attachment-id=\"65038\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/two-of-big-wests-best-face-off-at-harder-stadium/wsoccer9-6-15christinademarzo13-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo13-web.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Running towards the goal, Mallory Hromatko makes a move for the ball.

Currently on a three-game winning streak, Santa Barbara moves on to play a talented and well coached Long Beach State team.</p>\n<p>With two of the conference’s most reputable head coaches in UCSB’s Paul Stumpf and Long Beach State’s Mauricio Ingrassia, Sunday’s matchup will be a rewarding matchup highlighting two well recognized programs and their strategic ways of winning.</p>\n<p>“[Long Beach] plays a system that matches up very well with what we want to do,” Stumpf said. “But [Ingrassia] is a very intelligent person so if we start dominating the match they will be prepared with a plan B.”</p>\n<p>Both head coaches have compiled an impressive resume for their respective programs, Stumpf culminating a record of 145-133-36 and Ingrassia posting a record of 124-76-26.</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams faced off on Oct. 5, the 49ers cruised to a 2-0 victory at George Allen Field. Look for Long Beach to try and put sophomore forward Ashley Gonzalez in scoring position once again.</p>\n<p>The former Big West Freshman of the Year currently ranks seventh in conference this year with five goals. Gonzalez also scored the go-ahead-goal in the 82nd minute last October versus UCSB, leading Long Beach to a win.</p>\n<p>The 49ers have had their share of success in non-conference play this year stealing two crucial wins, one at DePaul and another hosting UCLA.</p>\n<p>“Long Beach has two huge wins this year [against UCLA and DePaul],” Stumpf said. “So they’re a confident crew and it should lead to a great game.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos host Long Beach State this Sunday at Harder Stadium.

For a team hungry to win its first Big West Championship in five years, the wait is finally over.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara opens up Big West play with road games today and Saturday against UC Irvine and Cal State Northridge, respectively. The Gauchos enter tonight’s match with a 5-3-1 record, which includes statement wins over No. 3 Stanford and on the road at UCLA.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters were a national powerhouse last season, but have not found nearly the same success this time around, starting the year at 2-5-2. The Matadors started slowly in 2015, but won their last three games on the road to improve to 4-3-1 heading into conference play.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As a team, UCSB has been the best on offense this season, currently leading the Big West with 18 goals through nine games. Junior Nick DePuy has been a model of consistency since moving from the midfield to forward midway through last season, scoring 16 goals in his 22 games up front. He currently leads the Big West with seven goals and was named this week’s Big West Offensive Player of the Week.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong came into the year as a player to watch coming out of Cate School and he has not disappointed. The lefty notched his fourth assist of the year in the Gauchos’ 4-0 win over San Diego this past Sunday, making him the conference’s sole leader in assists.</p>\n<p>Also providing an offensive punch has been sophomore Ahinga Selemani, who transferred from Michigan after his freshman year. The 5-8 forward has already matched his totals from last year with three goals and is currently tied with DePuy and one other player for first in the conference with 28 shots.</p>\n<p>Injuries have begun to wear UCSB down a bit, with several starters being kept out of the lineup in recent games. Juniors Ismaila Jome and Drew Murphy were unavailable to close out the Gauchos’ last four games, while sophomore center back Jeff Quezada suffered an injury in practice that kept him out for last weekend’s games.</p>\n<p>In Quezada’s absence, the defense has looked shaky at times, but a pair of freshmen in defender Sam Strong and goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg have been solid all year. The Gauchos are currently ranked fifth in the conference having allowed 11 goals to opposing teams.</p>\n<p>UCI has struggled to start the year, but it hosts UCSB tonight seemingly having solved its offensive problems which caused it to stumble out of the gates. Through their first seven games, the Anteaters were shutout four times, putting away just three goals total.</p>\n<p>In the past week, however, they have found a rhythm, putting away four scores in a win over LMU on Thursday, followed up by a three goal effort in a 4-3 overtime loss to UCLA.</p>\n<p>The second half could be worrisome for the Gauchos, who have conceded eight of their 11 goals allowed after halftime. This might favor the Anteaters, who have put away all but one of their 10 goals in the second stanza.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Ivan Canales leads the offense in goals and assists with three each.</p>\n<p>The Matadors host Cal Poly tonight and UCSB on Saturday having won three consecutive games on the road. They have dominated the conference awards in recent weeks, with the past two Defensive Player of the Week winners and the Offensive Player of the Week from two weekends ago.</p>\n<p>Senior goalkeeper Adam Hobbs took home the most recent defensive honors, stopping a penalty and maintaining a 1-0 shutout against San Diego last Friday. Senior defender and captain Trevor Morley earned the award the week prior, holding Saint Mary’s and Santa Clara to just one goal in 180 minutes while adding two goals of his own on penalties.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side, redshirt senior Carlos Gonzalez leads the team with four goals, three of which he scored in 29 minutes off the bench at Saint Mary’s to earn his first ever Offensive Player of the Week award.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos play at UC Irvine tonight at 7 p.m. and will head to Northridge to take on the Matadors Saturday at 5 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64980\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/big-west-opening-weekend-time-for-business/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64980\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/big-west-opening-weekend-time-for-business/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/big-west-opening-weekend-time-for-business/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/big-west-opening-weekend-time-for-business/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/big-west-opening-weekend-time-for-business/","id":1507,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1506,1505,1504],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
