Head Coach Angela Kelly and her Longhorns finished the 2014 season with an 11-8-4 record, good enough to clinch the fifth seed in conference play. The Longhorns are a confident team on the road claiming a record of 6-2 last season so expect them to play with poise and not be phased by the Gaucho Locos.</p>\n<p>Notables for Texas include 5-10 sophomore Olivia Brook. As a freshman, Brooke led the team in scoring with 16 points, seven goals and 18 shots on goal. Brooke proved to be the offensive target for Texas, registering a game-winning goal against archrival No. 21 Texas Tech for an upset win in overtime.</p>\n<p>Senior mid Lindsey Meyer will also be a player that UCSB must defend well against. Meyer finished second overall on the team in scoring with 12 points and five goals. Like Brooke, Meyer is not afraid of the big moment, seizing two game-winners during her junior campaign including one in the Big-12 Quarterfinal against Texas Tech.</p>\n<p>Defending that Longhorn frontline and containing the play of duo Brook and Meyer will be a crucial factor in UCSB’s success on Friday.</p>\n<p>As for the Gauchos’ key to success their strategy is simple: continue to attack the frontline as they did in their match against San Jose State.</p>\n<p>Coach Stumpf found that his forwards are at their best when they act as the aggressor and must use their athleticism to their advantage against the Longhorns’ backline.</p>\n<p>“The challenge that our frontline faces is to maintain possession so we can have numbers and pick and choose their moments to take a risk for a scoring opportunity,” Stumpf said. “We need to do a better job keeping the ball when it’s required and deciding when to drop a shoulder to beat someone 1-v-1.”</p>\n<p>On top of their big match against Texas on Friday, the Gauchos host another non-conference opponent this Sunday in Sacramento State. The Hornets are currently 0-3 on the year including a 2-1 loss to San Jose State last Sunday.</p>\n<p>Look for junior midfielder Maggie Pleis to be a focal point for Sac State. Pleis leads the team this season with one goal and three shots on goal. Pleis earned the honor of All Big-Sky Second Team as a sophomore and racked up 22 shots with 10 shots on goal for the Hornets last season.</p>\n<p>Heading into this weekend, Stumpf emphasized that his team must be very mindful and take care of themselves.</p>\n<p>“Friday night is going to be very physically demanding on us. No matter what happens, we will have to put that behind us and do everything we can physically and mentally to be ready for Sacramento.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos kickoff their match with Texas tomorrow at 7 p.m. and Sac State on Sunday at 1 p.m at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

soccer team heads on its first road trip of the season to Albuquerque this weekend for games against Denver and New Mexico.</p>\n<p>“Our expectation is that we finish the weekend without giving up any goals,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “I think what we’re looking to do more than anything is getting our offense on track. That’s what I’m anxious to see this weekend.”</p>\n<p>With just one game under their belt, the Gauchos jumped up to a No. 19 national ranking based on the NSCAA Coaches poll earlier this week. Last Friday’s win made it five straight season-opening victories for UCSB, putting its record at 10-1 over the last 11 years.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Junior forward Nick DePuy comes in as the Gauchos’ lone scorer, having put away the deciding goal in the 1-0 win over Stanford. Dating back to last year, the former midfielder has been on an incredible hot streak, scoring in six of his last seven games with eight total goals during that span.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re way too good offensively to not be able to dominate these two games, create goalscoring chances and maybe put two, three, four goals away,” Vom Steeg said. “At some point this year we’re going to be a team that other teams are really going to fear because we can come at you in a lot of different ways.”</p>\n<p>Last Friday’s game also welcomed defender Sam Strong to the lineup for the first time. The composed freshman gave an outstanding debut performance, shutting down a high-profile athlete in Stanford’s junior forward Jordan Morris, resulting in his being named the Big West Defensive Player of the Week. <em>College Soccer News</em> also named Strong to the National Team of the Week.</p>\n<p>“Sam and [sophomore defender Jeff] Quezada had a good game, our whole backline did, but we’re going to have to do it again,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re playing a New Mexico team that is going to be one of the better teams in the country. We have our work cut out for us, but Sam and Quezada played together all spring so they do have the chemistry, and I think there’s no reason why we can’t expect to shut people down again.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the Gauchos, they will be without starting goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg. The superb freshman received a call up to the US Under-20 National Team roster to play in the Stevan Vilotic-Cele Tournament in Serbia this weekend after a solid performance of his own against last Friday.</p>\n<p>In Vom Steeg’s absence, sophomore goalkeeper Brandon Berke, who started and played well for much of last season, will get the start.</p>\n<p>“We’re in a fortunate situation where Brandon was in our goal last year for three quarters of the season,” Vom Steeg said. “It is an adjustment, you do lose a little bit of height with Brandon but at the same time he’s athletic, he’s quick, he gets to balls, he’s a hard-working goalkeeper and he has the confidence of the team.”</p>\n<p>With new Head Coach Jamie Franks leading the way, Denver has gotten off to a fantastic start to its 2015 campaign. The Pioneers have started 2-0-0, including a 4-0 win over CSU Bakersfield in their season opener. Taking into account their two exhibition games last month, they have gone a perfect 4-4 on shutouts this year.</p>\n<p>“I always feel like when any program has a new coach their players really listen and they’re all trying to prove themselves,” Vom Steeg said. “I always find that those are tough teams to play because you have a team that’s got a lot of energy and a lot of life.”</p>\n<p>New Mexico has played just one game this season, losing 1-0 to UCLA last Saturday. When the Lobos last hosted UCSB in 2013, they shut down the Gauchos on their way to a 1-0 win.</p>\n<p>“New Mexico is a lot like us in that they will have a very large crowd<strong>. </strong>They are a team that’s usually built for their field, and it’s just one of the harder places to play,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s going to be a test for us and it’s a game where you really start to find out a lot about your team, especially when you’re on the road.”</p>\n<p>Playing on the road has caused problems for UCSB in the past, as it won just three of nine games away from Harder Stadium last year, and New Mexico’s impactful crowd support could make it a difficult environment to play in. However, with a more experienced roster that won its last two crucial road games to close out the season in 2014, the Gauchos should perform well in their first road test.</p>\n<p>“This is one of the areas where we just have to do better,” Vom Steeg said. “If we can find a result, that’s something that we can continue to build on. We have four consecutive road games and we’re going to know a lot more about the kind of team and the kind of season we’re going to have.”</p>\n<p>UCSB plays Denver at 3:00 p.m. PDT on Friday and New Mexico at 5:00 p.m. PDT on Sunday at CIBER Field in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

team’s disappointing 4-1 loss to archrival Cal Poly on the road, the UCSB men’s soccer team saw one positive come out of last weekend and that was the 3-0 loss that third place Sac State experienced to UC Davis; meaning that the second place seed was no longer up for grabs.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, UCSB’s 15 total points in the standings have the team at 2<sup>nd</sup> overall on the Big West league table and the Big West North. The winner of the Big West South, Cal State Fullerton, only finished with 14 points.</p>\n<p>To summarize, the Gauchos’ regular season campaign featured a conference record of 4-3-3. The team proved to be inconsistent at times whether it is at home or on the road, but dominant enough to net them yet another playoff berth. Overall, the Gauchos finished 6-7-5.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Concerning statistic, the team only totaled 13 goals across nine matches, yet held opposing sides to 17 scores against them. However, as much as this speaks volumes for both the offensive and defensive sides for the Gauchos, the team still can cherish a combined 3 clean sheets on the year to go with their quarterfinalist position.</p>\n<p>When reflecting back at previous analysis to commence the season; not many would’ve figured UC Davis to have topped not only their division but also the entire Big West board.</p>\n<p>This is due in part because of their early first-round exit in last year’s playoff. Nonetheless, the Aggies appear to be the team to beat and the Gauchos have yet to beat them even after two encounters this season. In fact, UCSB was outscored in those two contests 8-0.</p>\n<p>Now, UCSB will look ahead to their first-round opponents as they draw UC Riverside at home to kick off the postseason. The Highlanders finished their collegiate season with an overall record of 4-12-1 and 4-5-1 Big West.</p>\n<p>One of those five conference losses came in an out of division matchup, on the road, against UCSB. The result was ultimately a 3-1 victory for the Gauchos, but thanks to the whopping 10 total saves from UC Riverside’s goalkeeper Vincent Morales, the score didn’t run up anymore.</p>\n<p>Besides a very talented goalie, the Highlanders also boast a fairly prolific goal scorer in junior forward Antonio Lokossou.</p>\n<p>He currently leads his team in the goals category with a total 5 tallies and also maintains the most shots at goal with 26 on the season. Paired with the team assist team leader of sophomore forward Anthony Lopez who has three helpers and two goals to his name, the Gauchos would be wise to game plan with these two in mind.</p>\n<p>As for UCSB, Rodney Michael once again stepped up for his time and netted the redemption score in their previous 4-1 loss. On the year, Michael continues to lead his team in both categories with eight goals and three assists (tied with Ignacio Tellechea).</p>\n<p>Easily claiming the team’s regular season MVP consideration, his success also extends to a league level as he is tied for second most Big West goals scored and third most shots taken.</p>\n<p>Michael also earned Big West Freshman of the Year and Big West All-First Team Honors.</p>\n<p>Freshman goalkeeper Alan Carrillo will also be a big key to the Gauchos postseason success if they enjoy any. The La Mirada native has allowed nine of his 24 goals allowed in the last three games.</p>\n<p>His 1.27 goals against average still rank fourth in the Big West, and his 50 total saves rank sixth, however, he must play better if he hopes to lead the Gauchos to the semifinals.</p>\n<p>He, alongside Michael, was named to the Big West All-Freshman Team while senior defender Randy Mendoza was named to the All-Big West Second Team.</p>\n<p>With a hopefully continued success through the postseason, and if the Gauchos could relocate their once solid defensive line, then UCSB can very well consider a deep run in the Big West playoff race.</p>\n<p>From here on out it’s simple, single elimination games and Wednesday’s victors will land themselves a ticket to Saturday’s semifinal games; thus propelling them that much closer to the following week’s Big West Finals and that coveted championship title.</p>\n<p>Big West early round championship locations still remain on campus sites, so the Gauchos will be hosting UC Riverside this Wednesday, November 1<sup>st</sup>, at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79468\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-01/mens-soccer-hosts-uc-riverside-in-big-west-first-round-bout/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79468\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-01/mens-soccer-hosts-uc-riverside-in-big-west-first-round-bout/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-01/mens-soccer-hosts-uc-riverside-in-big-west-first-round-bout/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-01/mens-soccer-hosts-uc-riverside-in-big-west-first-round-bout/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-01/mens-soccer-hosts-uc-riverside-in-big-west-first-round-bout/","id":1512,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1511,1510,1509],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vom Steeg Becomes First to Reach 100 Big West Wins After UCR Shutout","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CamerynBrock-soccer-4-of-11-for20151008-web-e1444367766871.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CamerynBrock-soccer-4-of-11-for20151008-web-e1444367766871.jpg?resize=401%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Nick DePuy records his nation-leading sixth game-winner as the Gauchos defeat UCR.

Santa Barbara’s third consecutive win to open up conference play gives Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg 100 Big West wins in his career, making him the first ever coach to reach that milestone.</p>\n<p>“I told the team tonight we had an opportunity to go take a picture in front of the scoreboard and put it up on a wall somewhere,” Vom Steeg said. “That’s not just Tim Vom Steeg’s 100 wins, but it’s UCSB’s 100 wins.”</p>\n<p>Now winners in six of their last seven games, the Gauchos improve to 8-3-1 overall and a perfect 3-0 in conference. The Highlanders are now 5-6-1 overall and 1-2 in Big West.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I thought that Riverside was one of the more dangerous teams that we’ll play all season long,” Vom Steeg said. “Credit to the players, I thought we made a real concerted effort to get a shutout tonight.”</p>\n<p>There wasn’t much to be excited about through the first 70 minutes of play, but that suddenly changed as the Gauchos were able to find the breakthrough off a left-footed strike by forward Nick DePuy. The goal was DePuy’s fifth in four games and his sixth game-winner of the season — the most of any player in the nation.</p>\n<p>“As the game goes on, you want to have Nick on your team,” Vom Steeg said. “At some point, all season long, he’s found the net.”</p>\n<p>The unstoppable junior now has a conference-best 11 goals on the season, already surpassing his total of 10 from last year. Since moving out of the midfield to forward midway through last season, DePuy has 20 goals in the Gauchos’ last 25 games, making him the country’s top goal scorer during that stretch.</p>\n<p>“I just make sure every chance I get I put on target,” DePuy said. “I’m learning each game and trying to get better each day. It takes a lot of practice and repetition, but I’ve been working hard and hopefully I can keep scoring.”</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams played at Riverside in 2014, UCSB was just barely able to hold on to an ugly 1-1 tie despite playing with nine men down the stretch. Playing under the bright lights of Harder Stadium this time around, it looked like things would be different as UCSB came out firing, recording the first seven shots of the game.</p>\n<p>Good scoring chances were scarce, but the Gauchos found their first about 20 minutes in. After some well-worked passing, the ball came loose deep in the box where sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani and DePuy both had chances to open the scoring.</p>\n<p>Selemani couldn’t make contact with his twisting effort, but the ball fell to DePuy’s feet right at the edge of the six-yard box. After a quick turn to aim toward the goal, DePuy was unable to get hold of the ball and sailed the shot high.</p>\n<p>Riverside wasn’t able to record a shot until the 21st minute, but the momentum seemed to switch from there as the Highlanders forced UCSB freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg to make three saves over a ten-minute stretch.</p>\n<p>DePuy had another good scoring chance to open the second half after a nice 1-2 combination with freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong, but UCR’s senior goalkeeper Ashkan Khosravi kept it scoreless with a diving save.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were finally able to open the scoring in the 70th minute. Quickly capitalizing on a turnover in play on his offensive half, DePuy found himself with enough space to get off a shot with his weaker left foot, slotting it past the keeper and inside the right post.</p>\n<p>“I was just thinking, ‘Take the guy on,'” DePuy said. “We had a chance in the first half and I kind of rushed it and hit it wide. I really wanted to just get my touch out in front of me, hit it low and hard, and that’s what I did.”</p>\n<p>With the game not yet decided, a moment of brilliance from Acheampong less than eight minutes later put the game away for UCSB. Attacking down the left wing, the Cate School graduate cleanly split a pair of UCR defenders in the box with a nifty, controlled dribble.</p>\n<p>A third defender rushed forward from the middle of the box, but the crafty freshman slipped by to set himself up on his favored left foot. Despite a difficult angle, Acheampong put his rocket left foot to work, blasting a shot past the keeper and inside the far post, clinching the 2-0 win.</p>\n<p>“Geoffrey was a handful on the outside for them,” Vom Steeg said. “In that situation, a double team, Geoffrey’s still going to look to play inbetween two and break through. He broke in with the idea of getting the shot off, hitting it hard and keeping it down, and it got us the second goal.”</p>\n<p>Acheampong is now tied with Selemani for second on the team with three goals to go along with his team-best four assists.</p>\n<p>“Effectively, that second goal was the game,” Vom Steeg said. “[Riverside is] a team that relies on one mistake and one shot. The minute that scores goes 2-0, now it’s going to take two shots. At that point, you can see their team just dropped off.”</p>\n<p>UCSB outshot Riverside 16-9 on the night, including seven shots from DePuy. The Gauchos earned their second shutout in their last eight games.</p>\n<p>With the win, Vom Steeg became the first coach in Big West history to reach the 100-win milestone. He now has a career record of 226-95-38 through 17 years as UCSB’s head coach, including a 100-28-17 record in conference games.</p>\n<p>Up next for the Gauchos is a home matchup with Cal State Fullerton on Saturday as they look to continue their hot start in conference play. The Titans are the only other Big West team that has gone undefeated in conference play thus far, going 2-0-1.</p>\n<p>“I don’t care particularly much for Fullerton. Last year we went down there and absolutely got manhandled in that game,” Vom Steeg said. “We’ll absolutely be ready to play on Saturday. We’re going to compete we’re going to hit, score some goals, and we’re going to defend. Shutout number two, that will be the mission for the team.”</p>\n<p>The game with Fullerton will kickoff at 7 p.m. on Saturday at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65151\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/vom-steeg-becomes-first-to-reach-100-big-west-wins-after-ucr-shutout/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65151\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/vom-steeg-becomes-first-to-reach-100-big-west-wins-after-ucr-shutout/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/vom-steeg-becomes-first-to-reach-100-big-west-wins-after-ucr-shutout/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/vom-steeg-becomes-first-to-reach-100-big-west-wins-after-ucr-shutout/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/vom-steeg-becomes-first-to-reach-100-big-west-wins-after-ucr-shutout/","id":1510,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1509,1508,1507],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
