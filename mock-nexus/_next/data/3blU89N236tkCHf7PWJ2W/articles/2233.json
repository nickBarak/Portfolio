The university is demanding less security and more inequality for tens of thousands of its workers, and that is completely at odds with its promise to ‘pioneer a better future’ for California.”</p>\n<p>Today’s protests at UCSB were part of a much bigger UC-wide demonstration that encompasses all 10 campuses.</p>\n<p>Protestors will strike from Oct. 23 to Oct. 25, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. They will hold rallies from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. each day under Storke Tower.</p>\n<p>Nothing has improved for AFSCME workers since the last demonstration, according to Bill Fitzpatrick, campus representative of University Professional &amp; Technical Employees (UPTE).</p>\n<p>UPTE workers are striking this week in solidarity with AFSCME.</p>\n<p>“The university has now forced [the workers] to accept the terms of the university’s offers without the benefit of any more negotiations,” Fitzpatrick said.</p>\n<p>Fitzpatrick, who represents 1,040 people in UPTE and voices their concerns to UC administration, has spent the past year and a half traveling to various UC campuses to bargain for workers’ conditions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“Students usually think of custodian staff or groundskeepers as ‘ghost people.’ They don’t want to see them, they just want to see the product of their work.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>UCSB workers are among the lowest paid in the system, despite the high cost of living associated with the Santa Barbara area, Fitzpatrick said.</p>\n<p>“Nobody is asking for an outrageous paycheck. We have a couple of titles here where the potential pay is 52 percent lower than the UC Davis campus for the same job titles. We are demanding an explanation of why that would be fair to us, why we are among the lowest paid campuses.”</p>\n<p>For Esther Ramirez, a senior custodian in the Santa Catalina Residence Hall for the past 15 years, the future of UC workers’ conditions remains unclear.</p>\n<p>“It’s the second strike; I don’t know what is next,” Ramirez said. “It’s hard because I’m a single mom, and my family of three needs to take other jobs to support the family.”</p>\n<p>According to a UC worker who asked to remain anonymous, UC employees are often considered invisible.</p>\n<p>“Students usually think of custodian staff or groundskeepers as ‘ghost people.’ They don’t want to see them, they just want to see the product of their work.”</p>\n<p>Dozens of UC Santa Barbara students, as well as several professors, were among the workers on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Shelsea Sanchez, a second-year political science major and student worker in the dining commons, said she felt the need to support her coworkers in the demonstration.</p>\n<p>“I see and interact with these workers on a daily basis and see how the UC is super exploitative when it comes to working conditions,” she said.</p>\n<p>“I have to use my voice as a student to come out and represent those people who can’t talk for themselves.”</p>\n<p>Sanchez is hopeful more students will gather for the protests on Wednesday and Thursday, adamant that students have a unique platform to advocate for reform.</p>\n<p>”Everybody here loves working at their jobs and would love to stay here. But if the UC can’t make it affordable to where we can’t afford to work at a UC and live in the Santa Barbara area, a lot of people aren’t able to stay with us,” Fitzpatrick said.</p>\n<p>“We would love to come to terms with a fair contract and get back to work without this distraction.”</p>\n<p>Further <em>Nexus</em> coverage for the strike can be viewed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/1054710350061301763\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

id=\"caption-attachment-84068\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The bicycles can be unlocked using the HOPR app. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p>The latest addition to the UCSB and I.V. communities – courtesy of the start-up company HOPR and complete with the tagline “Hop around UCSB” – first appeared over a month ago.</p>\n<p>James Wagner, program manager for UCSB’s Transportation Alternatives Program, said bike sharing has been on UCSB’s radar “for at least a dozen years.”</p>\n<p>“A lot of students will buy a bike maybe used for $50, or maybe a new bike for close to $100,” Wagner said. “For a similar kind of dollars you can use a bike that is easy to use, has three speeds … if something happens to the bike after you lock it, it’s not on you anymore.”</p>\n<p>CycleHop LLC, HOPR’s parent company, launched the HOPR-transit mobile app in Spring 2018, according to the company’s website.</p>\n<p>The HOPR bicycles are equipped with a “smart bike share system,” meaning that anyone can use the bicycles as long as they have the app on their smartphone. Users can also report problems with the bicycle through the app.</p>\n<p>The first official steps toward bringing a bicycle sharing program to campus first began three years ago, said Mo Lovegreen, UCSB’s campus sustainability director.</p>\n<p>“A board was formed that included UCSB, the County of Santa Barbara, the City of Santa Barbara, the Santa Barbara Waterfront, SBCC, SBCAG, MTD, the Santa Barbara Bicycle Coalition [and] the City of Goleta,” Lovegreen said in an email.</p>\n<p>The group agreed UCSB should take the lead on the program, include Isla Vista and then expand into the cities of Goleta and Santa Barbara down the road, according to Wagner.</p>\n<p>UCSB then received proposals from eight bicycle-sharing companies looking to set up in the area, Lovegreen said.</p>\n<p>“A.S. Bikes and a number of students on campus participated in developing the scoring rubric for the proposals as well as the bikes, they also test-rode the bikes, and were part of the decision making body for the vendor,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>HOPR’s “no cost” offer was what ultimately sealed the deal. The company said it would shoulder the full cost of the program, which would have otherwise costed the university around $1.5 million dollars for the initial start-up.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84080\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84080\" data-attachment-id=\"84080\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-27/hopping-into-the-new-school-year-hopr-bike-share-has-arrived/hopr-app/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?fit=2048%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"hopr app\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-84080\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=888%2C888\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=1472%2C1472&amp;ssl=1 1472w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84080\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Users can locate bicycles and their “pods” on the HOPR app. <em>Courtesy of HOPR app</em></p></div>\n<p>HOPR signed a three-year-long contract in early May 2019, according to Callie Price, UCSB’s purchasing and contracts manager. The contract can be extended before it expires.</p>\n<p>Each bike normally costs somewhere between $1,500 and $5,000, Wagner said.</p>\n<p>“For dock bikes, there are dock costs, and then there’s transaction fees for the credit cards and maintenance and all sorts of things,” Wagner said.</p>\n<p>The first 1,000 students who sign for the annual membership with their UCSB email – and also qualify for financial aid through UCSB – will receive half the membership money back into their Billing Accounts Receivable Collection (BARC).</p>\n<p>The bicycle sharing program is also an added bonus to a campus where over 1,500 bicycles are abandoned every year.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got a waste problem in terms of abandoned bikes,” Wagner said. “We do sell some of them; the CSOs do a sale at the third week of every quarter in order to put some of those bikes back into service, but usually they only sell a 150 back to the students.”</p>\n<p>“Maybe, as people use more and more bike share bikes, there will be fewer bikes abandoned.”</p>\n<p>HOPR plans to add more than 900 additional bicycles to the UCSB and I.V. area by January 2019, according to Wagner. Eventually, “upgraded” bicycles, such those with electric pedals, will be integrated into the campus.</p>\n<p>“A lot of our students ride bikes at night without any lights or reflectors, or anything else. The HOPR bikes all have front rear lights that activate whenever you ride,” Wagner said.</p>\n<p>“Students are riding HOPR bikes that are well-lit, brand new and are frequently maintained and inspected. Hopefully that will keep everyone who rides them safer.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

renewable energy sources. <em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p>On Sept. 4, the UC Office of the President (UCOP) announced in a press release that this “expansion of its system-wide sustainability goals” was a part of the UC’s Carbon Neutrality Initiative.</p>\n<p>The Carbon Neutrality Initiative began in 2013, when UC President Janet Napolitano proposed the goal of making the UCs a zero net energy consumer by 2025.</p>\n<p>Along with the 2013 commitment to become carbon neutral, UC now also aims for “100 percent reliance on clean electricity suppliers across its campuses and medical centers by 2025,” according to the press release.</p>\n<p>UC has already saved $220 million by utilizing its energy efficiency programs.</p>\n<p>At UC Santa Barbara, students have been working on the 100 Percent Campaign for the past two years, according to Adriana Munoz, the vice chair of UCSB’s California Public Interest Research Group (CALPIRG) branch.</p>\n<p>“CALPIRG Students have been working very hard to create buzz about renewable energy by talking to thousands of students about this issue and signing them up as members to our organization,” Munoz said in an email.</p>\n<p>“We’ve also worked with other student organizations as well as with faculty to show overall campus support for this issue.”</p>\n<p>She added that the campaign has been a priority due to the effects of climate change on California, which include fires that have occurred close to UCSB’s campus, such as the Thomas Fire, the second largest fire in the state’s history.</p>\n<p>“We are so proud that our UC system is working with students in order to take more steps towards a clean energy future and CALPIRG Students looks forward to working with them on this issue further,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>UC is also committed to not using on-site fossil fuel combustion for new buildings and renovations after June 2019, as well as reducing its overall energy-use intensity, the press release said.</p>\n<p>The UC commitment precedes Governor Jerry Brown’s signing of Senate Bill 100 on Sept. 10.</p>\n<p>SB 100, authored by State Senator Kevin de León, requires the state of California to use 100-percent renewable and zero-carbon electricity sources by 2045.</p>\n<p>“With Governor Brown’s order, California establishes the most ambitious carbon neutrality commitment of any
