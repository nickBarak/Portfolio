As the Divisional round of the NHL playoffs began this week, the battle for the Stanley Cup grew more and more fierce as rivals were pitted against each other in all four series. Out west, the Ducks and the Blackhawks continue to flex their muscles as both teams hold a 2-0 series lead over their opponents. The Eastern conference has been much less one-sided as Tampa Bay currently holds a 2-0 series lead, but required double overtime to beat the Canadiens in game 1. The Capitals and the Rangers have provided the most entertaining series thus far and the heroics of Braden Holtby have led Washington to a 2-1 series lead.<br>\n<strong>Washington Capitals vs. New York Rangers (2-1 Capitals)</strong>– Wow. This series has the feel of a Stanley Cup finals and it is only three games in. Alex Ovechkin has been lights out just like he has been all season and may have had the goal of the year in their 3-2 loss to the Rangers in game two. Hats off to Braden Holtby who has outplayed his counterpart Henrik Lundqvist so far, including a masterful 30 save shutout in the Capitals 1-0 victory on Monday. New York’s offense has been their only question mark this postseason and those questions are becoming more and more prevalent as they have only mustered four goals in three games so far and seem to be relying a bit too heavily on their top-notch goaltending.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2pjERKAc_8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span><br>\n<strong>Anaheim Ducks vs. Calgary Flames (2-0 Ducks)</strong>– Calgary has been this years Cinderella story in the NHL playoffs, but it looks like their run may come to abrupt end if the Ducks keep playing the way that they are. Anaheim cruised to a 6-1 victory over the Flames in game one and Calgary goaltender Jonas Hiller did not even make it out of the first period against his former team. Frederik Andersen has solidified himself as the Ducks top goaltender and is playing like he wants the Stanley Cup, giving up only one goal over the first two games of the series. Anaheim is the only undefeated team in the postseason and the farther they advance, the more advantageous all of their rest will be. Calgary needs to work some of their magic at home to have any chance of advancing as Jiri Hudler, Johnny Gaudreau, and Sean Monahan have all been held without a point through two games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Chicago Blackhawks vs. Minnesota Wild (2-0 Blackhawks)</strong>– Devan Dubnyk has been another feel-good story this season as his play in net has propelled Minnesota to an improbable run to the second round of the playoffs. Chicago has scored 8 goals in their first two games, including two beauties from Patrick Kane in the Blackhawks 4-1 victory in game two. Corey Crawford has been back in net and has not been perfect, but has made 30 saves in both victories and has done enough to win with an electric offense in front of him. Minnesota is not out of it yet though as Devan Dubnyk and an electric offense led by Zach Parise will be in desperation mode over the next few days to even this series. That will not be possible if the Wild defenseman are unable to find an answer for the high-octane attack for the Blackhawks. All four lines have potential to put the puck in the net, but All-Star Wild defenseman Ryan Suter and company should be able to neutralize them better at home over the next two games. I believe the depth of Chicago will ultimately be too much for the Wild to win this series.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3NwYoaT8IX4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span><br>\n<strong>Tampa Bay Lightning vs. Montreal Canadiens (2-0 Lightning)</strong>– This series is a classic case of an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object with the offense of Tampa Bay being pitted against likely MVP Carey Price for Montreal. So far it has been all Lightning all the time, as Tampa Bay needed seven games to beat Detroit; however, they have dominated Atlantic division rival Montreal so far. Tyler Johnson has been masterful all postseason and scored his seventh goal of the playoffs in a 2-1 double overtime thriller in game one. Game two was not early as close as the Lightning charged their way to a 6-2 victory at the Bell Centre. Rest has not deterred the Lightning so far and with games three and four in Tampa Bay, this series could ultimately be the most unlikely sweep of them all. Carey Price will bring his best to the table but it is up to the players around him to provide support if the Canadiens have any hopes of moving on.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

This was before Sam — a defensive lineman and a leader on the team — knew his name would be listed on NFL draft boards at the season’s end after a breakout year.</p>\n<p>“I came up to my team and told them ‘Hey, I’m Michael Sam, I’m from Hitchcock, Texas, my major is Sport Management, and I’m gay.’ That was the first time I ever said I was gay,” he revealed.</p>\n<p>With that announcement, Sam set himself up for being the first openly gay player drafted into the NFL. Monday at Corwin Pavilion, he discussed his upbringing and coming out process in an event hosted by UCSB Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Growing up as the seventh of eight children in the Southeast Texas town of Hitchcock was not easy for Sam. His family name was synonymous with trouble in the area. Two of his siblings died before he turned six, and one was shot down trying to rob a house. Two more brothers spent time in prison and one went missing in 1998.</p>\n<p>“They abused me daily and got to the point that I wasn’t safe at home,” Sam said of his brothers’ treatment towards him. “So I would always leave my house at odd hours. I would take long walks. It was very difficult for me.”</p>\n<p>His relationship with his parents mimicked a similar disconnect. Sam’s mother did not want him playing sports, leading to discord between the two. His father was in and out of his life. He discussed he originally wanted to come out to his parents at his graduation, but for some reason, backed out.</p>\n<p>When he did finally tell them, Sam had the impression his mother already knew, while his father did not say much. “He just went to the bar and got drunk,” Sam added.</p>\n<p>As he dealt with sexuality in his teen years, Sam found love in college. The image most associated with Sam is with his fiancé, Vito Cammisano, right after the St. Louis Rams drafted him in the final round of the NFL Draft. Cameras captured the couple embracing in a heartwarming hug and kiss. In January, Sam proposed to Vito on the couple’s trip to Rome on the same day as Sam’s birthday.</p>\n<p>Sam and Cammisano’s relationship wasn’t always a love story from the start. In fact, there was dislike for one another when they first met. Sam approached Cammisano at a party his freshman year, asking Cammisano if he was okay after noticing him hunched over almost as if he was about to vomit.</p>\n<p>“I said ‘Hey, are you OK?’ and Vito slowly looked up at me and said ‘Get away from me,’” Sam said. “I lost it. I don’t care who you are, you don’t disrespect me to my face. So I actually didn’t talk to Vito for two years.”</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until Sam decided to approach Cammisano at a bar that romance between the two ensued.</p>\n<p>“I bought him a drink and put my hand on his back and the rest is history,” Sam told the audience.</p>\n<p>Their relationship, however, took a turn for the worst. Fear of living in a small college town with the pressure of being a star player on the football team made it impossible for Sam to come out publicly; he wasn’t ready.</p>\n<p>Cammisano was already out and grew tired of not being able to be seen in public with Sam. The two broke up because of it.</p>\n<p>“We couldn’t go out together, we had to have our friends there and I had to be separated,” Sam said. “Eventually, we started fighting and it got really hard for us. Vito said he couldn’t do this anymore; this isn’t healthy for us.”</p>\n<p>Months passed, but the two got back together and have been with each other ever since. It was Vito who gave Sam the courage to come out. Many felt Sam gambled by coming out right before the draft because of possible discrimination he might face from NFL teams. Nonetheless, the Rams selected him with the 249th pick in the draft.</p>\n<p>While with St. Louis, he acknowledged he never felt excluded because of his sexuality. Instead, teammates treated him like any other rookie, making him carry team equipment and earn his spot on the team.</p>\n<p>It was in his second preseason game where he said he felt part of the team. It was also the same game in which he sacked Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel.</p>\n<p>Although he had a legitimate shot at a roster spot, his time in St. Louis was limited to only the preseason as he was released in the final round of cuts before the start of the season.</p>\n<p>He then bounced to the Dallas Cowboys’ practice squad, where he said teammates Tony Romo, Jason Witten and DeMarco Murray supported him throughout before he was waived.</p>\n<p>Sam is currently a free agent, waiting to get a call from an NFL team. When asked what he thought his chances of playing in the league are, he said he did not know, and is open to playing professionally in the Canadian Football League.</p>\n<p>Before his talk ended, Sam offered some final words of encouragement.</p>\n<p>“If you think you might be alone, someone might disown you, you might not have friends or people are trying to bully you, I say don’t be afraid.” Sam remarked. “… Together we will change the world for the better, for each one of us.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 11 of May 7, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

While a toe-for-toe brawl between the two is what everyone hoped for, Mayweather’s defensive actions would never allow this to happen. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"yiv3472043295s2\"><span class=\"yiv3472043295s3\"><span class=\"yiv3472043295bumpedFont15\">Constant clinching and </span></span><span class=\"yiv3472043295s3\"><span class=\"yiv3472043295bumpedFont15\">waiting for Pacquiao to give in are tactics that upset </span></span><span class=\"yiv3472043295s3\"><span class=\"yiv3472043295bumpedFont15\">viewers.

With plans of relinquishing all five of his titles, it will be interesting to see if he can end his career unblemished of defeat and possibly tie Rocky Marciano’s 49-0 overall record. </span></span></p>\n<p id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1430764541464_2430\" class=\"yiv3472043295s2\"><span id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1430764541464_2433\"><span class=\"yiv3472043295s3\"><span class=\"yiv3472043295bumpedFont15\">As for Pacquiao, what’s next in the fighter’s future is undetermined.

Looking to extend his undefeated streak and self-proclaimed title of being boxing’s best, the tale of the tape has Mayweather and Pacquiao matched up pretty evenly.</p>\n<p>As the prime of both boxers’ careers comes to nearing an end, Saturday’s match remains as a fight between the top two fighters in boxing. Mayweather, at age 38, is just two years older than Pacquiao (36). Other assets such as height and reach possess more significance when comparing the two.</p>\n<p>Mayweather has the upper hand in both categories at 5’8” and a five-inch advantage in reach at 72.” Although Pacquiao stands at 5’6 ½” with a reach of 67,” his left-hand fighting stance, better known Southpaw, is the primary concern for “TMT’s” head honcho.</p>\n<p>Known for being a defensive guru that has mastered the art of counter-punching, Mayweather has constantly outsmarted opponents with his patient approach. He tends to bait opponents while ducking and dodging until he finally finds that “sore spot” to pick at. Apparently this technique has been of value with the result of no losses, but Mayweather just might have to step outside of his comfort zone in his duel with the “Pacman.”</p>\n<p>It has been nearly three years since Mayweather’s last knockout. His controversial knockout of Victor Ortiz is the lasting glimpse we have of Mayweather putting someone on the canvas. Although Mayweather is known for his defensive trademark, earning his 48th victory may come down to a knockout.</p>\n<p>His advantage in reach possibly will provide him with the sufficient amount of spacing to put Pacquiao to sleep. But the pursuit of a knockout comes at a price as Pacquiao will undoubtedly stun Mayweather with some punches if he decides to become more offensively dependent.</p>\n<p>Pacquiao is known for his attacking style in the boxing ring and seems ready to go toe-to-toe with Mayweather. His aggressiveness to throw punches and land them will be key in the fight.</p>\n<p>Pacquiao contains a more lethal power punch than Mayweather, but it’s the amount of punches per round that he can land that is key. His ability to consistently outpunch Mayweather could be of benefit on the judges’ scorecards. Still, Pacquiao must remain accurate and not allow his aggressiveness to become reckless punches that could be beneficial to Mayweather.</p>\n<p>While the heroic story of Pacquiao, the “good guy,” beating Mayweather the “bad guy” would be a heartwarming ending to the ongoing beef between the two, let’s be realistic. Since his last loss in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Mayweather has catapulted boxing to a new platform with his dominance and will expand his legacy with a win Saturday evening.</p>\n<p>Mayweather versus Pacquiao has the potential to be the best fight this generation will see. All the “what if’s” and hopes of the two will finally be put to rest on Saturday when the two best pound-for-pound fighters meet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 11 of April 30, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62950\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/fight-of-the-century-pacquiao-vs-mayweather/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62950\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/fight-of-the-century-pacquiao-vs-mayweather/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/fight-of-the-century-pacquiao-vs-mayweather/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/fight-of-the-century-pacquiao-vs-mayweather/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/fight-of-the-century-pacquiao-vs-mayweather/","id":2020,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[2019,2018,2017],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
