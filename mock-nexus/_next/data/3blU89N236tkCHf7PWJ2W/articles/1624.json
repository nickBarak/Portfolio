That is the saying going around the UCSB women’s soccer team this year and that which the players have embraced as they prepare for the start of the season.<br>\nAn aggressive mentality and gritty play on the field, as well as the new motto, will be the backbone for this UCSB team.<br>\n“I think we have as reasonable a shot as everyone else,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “All the big teams in the Big West are so close that on any given day one person can kind of turn the other over. I think we have just as good of a shot as anyone just as long as we stay healthy.”<br>\nUCSB comes in with the goal of qualifying for the Big West Conference Tournament for the first time since 2009. Last season, Santa Barbara finished in ninth place in the league with only seven points earned in total.<br>\nThis season UCSB was picked to finish sixth in the Big West Conference Coach’s Poll. However, the Gauchos will have to stay healthy and overcome a lack of goal scoring that plagued the team last season. Although four players underwent offseason surgery and will not be ready for the early part of the season, the majority of the team enters in strong shape and focused on avoiding injury.<br>\n“We don’t want to have as many injuries as we did last year,” senior defender Lindsay Gankema said. “We all came in fit, which helped and we’re going to work in the weight room.”<br>\nSanta Barbara managed only 19 goals last season, the fewest in the entire league. Because of an inability to finish on many scoring opportunities, 13 new players were brought in this year with the intention of creating plays on offense and putting the ball on frame.<br>\n“A lot of them have different personalities on the field, meaning they have different styles of play,” junior midfielder Indiana Mead said. “I think they’re really technical, so they bring a new spark on the team we definitely needed.”<br>\nAdded playing time will also give experience to the freshman and add depth to offset potential injury down the stretch. Although the new freshman will try to make an impact early on, team chemistry is still something that the Gauchos have to develop in the first month of their non-conference schedule as they prepare for league play beginning in October.<br>\n“We’re working on [chemistry] because chemistry is important,” Gankema said. “I wouldn’t say it is necessarily hard but it’s going to take a little bit of time.”<br>\nThe blueprint for the Gauchos’ success this season centers primarily on the defensive end of the pitch. Four seniors will play defense for the Gauchos including twin sisters Paige and Lindsay Gankema and center back Taylor Gehring, who returns from injury this season. Four-year starting goalkeeper Makenna Henry, who played injured for a large portion of last season, will command the posts again this year.<br>\n“Defensively we will be very strong …  most of us have been really close on and off the field and we already have that chemistry,” Gankema said. “We all work really well together, we read each other very well and get back for each other and that makes us strong.”<br>\nUCSB plays 11 non-conference matches with its first conference game at home against UC Irvine on Oct 4.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 16 of August 28, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cedar Lay of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-look-strong-on-the-backline/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-look-strong-on-the-backline/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-look-strong-on-the-backline/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-look-strong-on-the-backline/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-look-strong-on-the-backline/","id":1624,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1623,1622,1621],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Friday Night: It’s Going to Be Loco","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/M-Soccer-by-Cedar-Lay.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/M-Soccer-by-Cedar-Lay.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Don't miss the Gauchos take on Stanford this Friday night in the first home game of the year.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB is an exciting place to go to school, but there are few events every year that really get the students going, more so than usual. Friday night is going to be one of those eventful nights as the UCSB men’s soccer team is set to face Stanford at Harder Stadium where record crowds are expected.<br>\nTraditionally, the first soccer home game after students move in is always a must-go event. This year is no exception as the Gauchos take on a prominent opponent in the Cardinal, and all of campus is abuzz in anticipation of Friday night’s match.<br>\n“Everyone is fired up for this game,” senior midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “Anytime we have a game at Harder Stadium it’s like we have this switch on. We receive most of our energy from the crowd.”<br>\nEntering the contest with a 4-3 record, UCSB must face a tough Stanford squad (4-1-1 on the season) that is set to spoil what looks to be one of the marquee matchups for the Gauchos this season.<br>\nThe last time UCSB faced such a well-known team on the first game following student move in was back in 2010 when the Gauchos set an NCAA on-campus record with 15,896 fans in attendance in a 2-0 victory against UCLA. Record crowds make sense when factoring in that UCSB has led the nation in attendance for six consecutive seasons.<br>\n“Friday is a huge game for us, and it’s one of the games that we need to have to keep our season going forward,” Baiden said. “Looking back on the UCLA game, it was really, really great to play under that crowd and it gives us that extra edge to go extra hard and play well. It’s going to be good for us in terms of energy, in terms of confidence, in terms of giving it all on the field.”                                                  Despite falling to New Mexico 1-0 and allowing a goal with 12 seconds left to play in overtime, the Gauchos are playing well and that all starts on the defensive side of the ball. Baiden stars alongside a trio of senior defenders in Peter Schmetz, Daniel Welsh and Matt Glodack to form a stingy backline that has allowed seven goals in seven games this season.<br>\nWith freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely in between the posts, UCSB’s defense has allowed one goal each of the last four games, with McNeely allowing a mere four goals in five starts.<br>\nWhile defense has been key for the Gauchos, the offensive production has seen rocky moments at times this season. Despite the efforts of a pair of seniors in forward Achille Campion and Goffin Boyoko, the Gaucho offense has failed to score in three separate occasions, the team’s only losses of the year. Campion and Boyoko are tied for the team lead in goals with three apiece.<br>\n“We have five freshmen who have been starting. We lost a lot of the goals that were scored last year, those players graduated or became professional players,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We’re having to find a different way of scoring this year and it has just taken some time. The younger players have gotten better every single game and we’re hoping that our seniors start to become consistently dangerous in front of the net.”<br>\nStanford, meanwhile, has won four straight, allowing one goal during that span. The Cardinal are led by senior goalkeeper Drew Hutchins who has allowed six goals in six starts, and are paced on the offensive end by junior forward Zach Batteer, as he has scored an impressive four of Stanford’s nine goals.<br>\nEven when considering Stanford’s talent on both sides of the ball, UCSB seems less dependent on talent and more so on energy that will fuel the team’s confidence entering Friday night.<br>\n“There’s just very few events that happen at UCSB where everyone can show up to one place,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s the one event where everyone at UCSB can come out and throw on a yellow shirt and cheer on our team. I think that makes the event special, it’s what makes UCSB special.”<br>\nOne thing is clear about the UCSB men’s soccer team entering Friday night. They want every single member of the UCSB community in attendance when they take the field against Stanford. It is, after all, another chance to make history.<br>\n“This is one of those moments where everyone can come together and cheer for our school and cheer for us to win the game. I would basically tell everyone don’t miss it,” Vom Steeg said. “Anyone who was at the UCLA game three years ago probably wishes there were more events like that because obviously that was a real special night. You want to be a part of that.”<br>\nFriday’s epic match is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. at Harder.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 8 of September 26, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cedar Lay of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52051\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/friday-night-its-going-to-be-loco/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52051\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/friday-night-its-going-to-be-loco/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/friday-night-its-going-to-be-loco/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/friday-night-its-going-to-be-loco/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/friday-night-its-going-to-be-loco/","id":1623,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1622,1621,1620],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Brings In 14 for 2013 Recruiting Class","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Despite losing only three seniors from last year’s team, the UCSB women’s soccer team will welcome 14 new players for its 2013 recruiting class.

Following a season where the team struggled putting the ball in the back of the net, the Gauchos add depth to their squad with versatile players at each position, primarily forward.</p>\n<p>“Part of the reason we have such a big recruiting class is because we felt we had to make some changes,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “There are a couple young ladies [coming in] that do score a pretty good number of goals for their high school teams and for their club team.”</p>\n<p>Headlining the class is a pair of teammates from San Ramon Valley High School, forward Morgan Idso and forward/defender Makenna Kummer. The two bring athleticism up top for the Gauchos and provide big targets inside the box with their size. In their senior year, the two combined for 10 goals and led their team to the CIF North Coast Section Tournament.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“They’re really good ball strikers. Morgan specifically has one of these knacks; when she shoots, it’s going on frame hard,” Stumpf said. “Makenna is going to be a more wide-striker type that’s going to deliver the balls.”</p>\n<p>Along with Idso and Kummer, forward/midfield Ashley Dean from Yucaipa High School and center midfielder McKinsey Martinez from Rancho Cucamonga High School have the potential to start right away as strikers for the Gauchos in the upcoming season.</p>\n<p>Dean gives UCSB a left-footed threat capable of scoring and is able to play multiple positions, most notably as an outside back that gets forward. Martinez, although undersized, provides another aerial threat for the Gauchos. Besides the ability to shoot, her playmaking abilities in the midfield makes another versatile player on the field, as she finished her senior season with six assists.</p>\n<p>“We had trouble scoring goals and these are all forwards we really feel they’re going to come in and challenge for starting spots right away,” Stumpf said. “If not that, they’re going to be the first ones coming off the bench.”</p>\n<p>Although three starters from the backline will be returning this season, the Gauchos will benefit from the arrival of Coto de Caza native Kailey Hackett from Santa Margarita Catholic High School. The central defender/sweeper also has the chance for competing for a starting position right away because of her defensive prowess on the pitch. As a senior she won a pair of titles and was selected as First Team All-CIF.</p>\n<p>Last year, the Gauchos only managed to score more than one goal twice in nine conference games. However, with the added size and talent coming from the recruiting class, UCSB will be more potent offensively in the upcoming season.</p>\n<p>“I think the size and I think the quality is two things that make this group standout,” Stumpf said. “We’re going to be a very different team next year.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Soccer.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"396943007\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51410\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51411\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/ucsb-brings-in-14-for-2013-recruiting-class/soccer-6/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Soccer.jpg?fit=550%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"550,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Soccer\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Soccer.jpg?fit=250%2C182&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Soccer.jpg?fit=550%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51411\" alt=\"Soccer\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Soccer-250x181.jpg?resize=250%2C181\" width=\"250\" height=\"181\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of May 16, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo Courtesy of UCSB Athletics.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51410\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/ucsb-brings-in-14-for-2013-recruiting-class/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51410\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/ucsb-brings-in-14-for-2013-recruiting-class/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/ucsb-brings-in-14-for-2013-recruiting-class/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/ucsb-brings-in-14-for-2013-recruiting-class/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/ucsb-brings-in-14-for-2013-recruiting-class/","id":1621,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1620,1619,1618],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Returning to Top Form","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/M-Soccer-File-Photo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/M-Soccer-File-Photo.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"After going 11 games to start the season without losing and earning a national ranking as high as No. 3, the UCSB men’s soccer team fell to Cal State Northridge Oct. 7.

Santa Barbara finished last in the North Division of the Big West, compiling a losing Big West record for the first time since 1991 and failing to make the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 11 seasons.</p>\n<p>“At one point in the season, we were 8-0-2 and it felt like we were in a really good position to not only make a playoff run but to compete for national championship,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Then, over the course of three weekends we started to lose players (to injury). We lost Campion, Schmetz and then it went from there. By the last game of the season, we had seven starters from the start of the year out.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The team loses six seniors to graduation this year, including midfielders Machael David and Nic Ryan. David was known for his control on the ball as defensive midfielder, but also tallied 10 assists during his career.</p>\n<p>Ryan, the reigning Big West Midfielder of the Year, led UCSB and ranked third in the Big West in goals with eight.</p>\n<p>“We lose a group of players which had been four-year key contributors,” Vom Steeg said. “We definitely lose some key players out of our midfield, but the fact is that it’s not as much about what you lose as what you return.”</p>\n<p>With the majority of the team still intact and seven starters returning, UCSB will look to continue its excellence as one of the country’s premier soccer programs next season. To help, UCSB brings in a big recruiting class composed of eight freshmen and four transfers.</p>\n<p>Headlining UCSB’s recruiting class are forward Reed McKenna and defender Isaiah Trejo, who are already at UCSB and played with the Gauchos during their spring season.</p>\n<p>“Both these players are expected to contribute right away, which is why we brought them here in spring,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re very familiar with both these recruits because these are players we recruited out of high school.”</p>\n<p>McKenna will fill a big weakness of UCSB’s from last season, which was putting the ball in the back of the net. The junior comes to UCSB after two seasons at UCLA and is a former No. 2-ranked Southern California player.</p>\n<p>“Last year when we started to lose our players to injury, we just stopped scoring goals,” Vom Steeg said. “Reed McKenna will go a long way toward filling that void. We need somebody to play with Campion, who had the ability to score 12 or 13 goals, so that’s why Reed is an important player to our team.”</p>\n<p>Trejo, a Clovis, CA native, returns to California after two years at Louisville. As a result, Trejo comes with lots of experience, playing for a program that competed for the national championship two years ago.</p>\n<p>“Trejo is an attacking wide player that can play in back,” Vom Steeg said. “We’ve always had that player that can come out of the back and attack wide. Trejo will give us the ability to attack out of the back.”</p>\n<p>Another transfer for UCSB is midfielder Adis Islamovic from Southern Polytechnic State University. There, he led his team to a 2012 NAIA Elite Eight appearance, earning second-team All-SSAC while tallying nine goals and five assists during the season.</p>\n<p>“[Adis] is a very good player who was unable to come here directly out of high school. He decided to go play a year in Germany,” Vom Steeg said. “He is an attacking midfielder. With the players we lost in David, Ryan and Josue Madueno, he is a player that can fill in that role.”</p>\n<p>As for the freshmen, three players that could make an immediate impact are goalkeeper Josh McNeely and midfielders Drew Murphy and Nick DePuy.</p>\n<p>McNeely has played for both the Los Angeles Galaxy Academy and the U.S. Soccer Development Academy. He was also a starter for the 2011 U.S. Soccer Academy National Championship team. With senior André Grandt graduating, McNeely fills the gap of a second goalkeeper.</p>\n<p>UCSB also brings in a teammate of McNeely’s from the Los Angeles Galaxy Academy, Drew Murphy. While playing with the Galaxy, Murphy also trained with the MLS Champion first team and was a member of the 2011 U.S. Soccer Academy’s National Championship team.</p>\n<p>“We’ll have to see which of the freshmen are able to step up to this level and that’s a little bit hard to tell,” Vom Steeg said. “I think we are particularly high on those that are playing at a high level (right now). The two players we have playing for the Galaxy, Josh and Drew, are two players because of where they’re playing right now at one of the top, if not the top club team in the country, so you might expect that they could contribute right away.”</p>\n<p>Finally, Nick DePuy becomes a Gaucho after earning the co-captain spot for Real Colorado, which went to the 2011 Region IV Quarterfinals and the Colorado State Championship. In addition, at Regis Jesuit High, DePuy led the team in goals and earned All-State and All-Conference honors.</p>\n<p>“[Nick’s] another midfielder who we feel has played at a high level and could contribute in the midfield,” Vom Steeg said. “We have a group of midfielders that we’re bringing in, so along with [Fifi Baiden], the big question going into the fall will be who plays in those other two or three spots based on who we play?”</p>\n<p>The slew of incoming players for UCSB will join seven returning starters next season, including 2012 all-Big West First Team member Baiden and the Big West Freshman of the Year, Ema Boateng.</p>\n<p>“What we are returning is basically seven starters and six of them are seniors,” Vom Steeg said. “There’s a lot to be excited about in terms of what’s returning.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will start their season August 24 against Westmont, marking the beginning of an exciting preseason schedule that includes teams such as Penn, UCLA and Yale.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 15th’s edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Daily Nexus File Photo</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51390\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-15/returning-to-top-form/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51390\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-15/returning-to-top-form/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-15/returning-to-top-form/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-15/returning-to-top-form/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-15/returning-to-top-form/","id":1622,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1621,1620,1619],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
