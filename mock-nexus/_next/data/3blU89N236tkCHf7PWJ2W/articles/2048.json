News Editor Katherine Swartz to discuss his work this past year, his thoughts on how young people should get involved in their communities and what comes next for him.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read the Q&amp;A below: </span></i></p>\n<p><b>Why did you decide to come to speak at UCSB?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I look at California…. there’s a lot of love from March for Our Lives in California, for many students especially. We go to UC Irvine all the time, or we did over the election, because that’s where a lot of young people can have the largest impact. I wanted to come and speak at UCSB because you know, it’s a cool school. There’s a lot of youth here that can have a big impact on elections, [who can] vote for morally just leaders that care about us. </span></p>\n<p><b>When did you first hear about the Isla Vista tragedy? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I first heard about [the Isla Vista 2014 shooting]… I think I was relatively young. There’s been so many shootings in California [and] as I’m sure many people realize, they kind of all end up coming together in our minds, which is horrible because they shouldn’t in the first place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I can say is that [the Isla Vista 2014 shooting] proves that we don’t just need states like California with stronger gun laws. We need states all over, all around the county, with stronger gun laws. We need support for victims in the first place, and for people to remember the fact that oftentimes, people don’t [support victims]… If we say Santa Fe, Texas, where there was a shooting right after Park[land] and then a couple months after, and no one remembers it. There’s a problem there. </span></p>\n<p><b>Have you spoken at any other schools that have experienced shootings in the past? What’s that like, that they’ve gone through what you previously went through?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t know if I’ve spoken at any schools that have gone through shootings in the past, I can’t remember. I’m sure there’s been individual shootings that have happened on various campuses that I’ve been at, [and there are] individuals that have been affected by gun violence in the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing I always ask, is I ask everybody to raise their hand that’s in the crowd that’s been affected by gun violence. There’s an unbelievable number of hands that go up. It’s always really hard because you realize, what I’ve realized in doing this work, is that it’s not just one community that’s traumatized by gun violence, that goes through mass shootings. It’s literally everywhere in the United States that go through everyday shootings where kids are lost on a daily basis. People are lost in mass shootings, suicides, every day, as a result of easy access to firearms. </span></p>\n<p><b>Can you walk me through some of the work you’ve been doing in the past, just an overview of that? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So the past year, a week after the shooting at my school, we went out with one message and that was: vote. Vote not for Democrats or Republicans, but morally just leaders that care about kids and young people dying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s what we focused on. We went out and… we registered thousands of young people to vote. And then after that we did a bus tour around the country, some letter writing, but more nationally…  [We] went to congressional districts where young people could have the largest impact on elections, then went to those congressional districts, registered voters, had town halls, formed a chapter there and got people active and involved in their community. We were able to vote out more NRA-backed politicians than ever before in American history. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of that, the NRA is kind of falling apart at the seams right now. That’s in part because of some of the work that we’ve been doing as well… the one question I always have is how the hell is the NRA a nonprofit, when they take millions of dollars in contributions from gun manufacturers on an annual basis. The way I think about it is, imagine if big tobacco companies that benefit from selling as many cigarettes as possible and then end up causing cancer, was a nonprofit. And that’s what the NRA is basically – [it is] violence in this county and around the world at this point. They’re expanding a lot. </span></p>\n<p><b>With the recent kind of falling apart, more and more, of the NRA, what will you and the others keep doing moving forward?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re focusing a lot more on what we’re fighting for. We’re focusing on how we’re fighting for peace in our communities. The fact that we live in one of the most violent countries in the world, being a more developed country, but still being extremely violent, [seeing] everyday acts of gun violence and shootings on a daily basis is a problem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also in the fact that we’re complicit in gun violence around the world. When I’m in California and places that are further south along the Mexico border, [what] I think about a lot of the time is – in Florida we don’t have this, because we don’t border Mexico – but in a lot of southern states like Texas, Arizona, and so on and so forth, do, and I think about the fears like the Trump Administration tries spreading about asylum seekers coming to the border from Guatemala and Honduras. The fact that they don’t talk about how literally we give a lot of guns </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> most of the guns that are used to kill civilians in Guatemala and Honduras or families that are caught in the crossfire as a result of the war on cocaine that the United States is trying to fight there </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are American-made guns that we’re complicit in. And then when these people, essentially refugees, start coming to our border, fleeing violence that we’re complicit in, and we tell them to go back, we’re committing an act of genocide. </span></p>\n<p><b>What made you decide to take a gap year to keep continuing this activist work for the past year? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wanted more time to heal. I wanted more time to speak to as many students across the country as possible. I also know that I would be extremely bothered by being in school. If I was in school during the election, I [would have] felt like I failed and I wasn’t doing as much as I could. So I took that gap year to work as much on the election as possible. </span></p>\n<p><b>So now that you’re starting school in the fall and you’ll be a full time student again, what are your plans moving forward with your work? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just to continue pushing. Not so much fight against something per se anymore, like we fought a lot against the NRA, which is a major part of this problem, but shifting our focus on what we’re actually fighting for in the future, which is a peaceful, nonviolent or significantly less violent America, where people don’t have to worry about whether or not they’re going to go through a shooting at their school. People won’t have to worry where an exit is in their classroom or a movie theater or anywhere else where shootings have happened, and nobody has to worry about living through a drive-by shooting or active everyday gun violence as millions of kids across the United States do on a daily basis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hopefully what I hope we can do is start [to] fund programs that use community based violence intervention, that hire former convicts. I’ve [looked at] the criminal justice system and [seen how] oftentimes [people] have caused violent acts or even killed someone, and reform themselves after going through the criminal justice system for 30 odd years or some odd years and come back and stop kids from going down the same path they’re going down, without incarcerating more youth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We realized that if putting more people in prison actually reduced gun violence in America, we wouldn’t be having his problem right now, with the highest prisoner population in the world. </span></p>\n<p><b>What shape will this work take now into the future? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think what it has to take is young people running for office and young people voting and not thinking of themselves as Democrats or Republicans, but thinking about what’s moral and right in the first place. Thinking about an America where we don’t have to constantly be so divided along party lines, but [where] we’re united against all forms of injustice and we’re all fighting against those forms of injustice, whether it be economic oppression, racial oppression, or any other form of injustice, because what gun violence is is a measure of injustice a community faces. The more gun violence a community has, the more injustice it actually faces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, like in Isla Vista or Parkland, both of those shootings are a result of political injustice… They should’ve been stopped way before Columbine, right? We should have put laws in place. When there [were] the first mass shootings in American history, we could have stopped these things in the first place, but they didn’t because we have politicians on both sides of the political aisle that are complicit in gun violence. We have to unite and rally for morally just leaders that care about gun violence and care about people dying, which is sad. It really is. But that’s what we have to do. We need young people to realize there’s extreme, large amounts of power that is not utilized at a local level, especially in local politics where much of it is essentially an elected cocktail party. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From what I’ve seen, people don’t run because they want to actually help their community; they run because they liked the title and the status that it brings them. We need to change that. We need kids to go out there and represent their community and realize that, even on our school boards </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> there’s many places across the United States where you don’t even have to be 18 to run for school board, there is no age limit </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and you can do that. There’s inherently a problem if we say we live in a representative democracy and we aren’t accurately represented by age, like how old congress is… There’s so many young people that are not represented in this county that only will be represented when they run for office themselves. </span></p>\n<p><b>What would you say to students who feel passionately about this issue and want to get involved but don’t know how and can’t necessarily run for office? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a chapter on the UCSB campus here, the March for Our Lives chapter, that does voter registration. We work on candidate town halls. We work on a multitude of subjects along with also just learning about gun violence and talking about gun violence, where students can come together and work around an issue. You can get politically involved without having to run for office, but also make a change in [your] community. </span></p>\n<p><b>As Isla Vista remembers five years since our tragedy, where do you hope the national conversation on gun violence will be five years from now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope [gun violence] doesn’t have to exist anymore because we [will] create actions that are in place and stop something like Isla Vista or Parkland, or any active everyday gun violence from occurring every again… I think in the future people are going to have this </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for lack of a better word </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ‘come to Jesus’ moment where they’re like, ‘How the hell did it takes us this long to actually respond to this issue, and how many people do we let die when we realized this was an issue but chose to do nothing about it?’ Because the thing that’s stopping us from ending gun violence and stopping all forms of shootings isn’t whether or not we care. It’s not whether or not young people in Isla Vista or Parkland, or Jamaica, Queens </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where my friend Erica Ford works </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or anywhere else, care. It’s not about Americans caring. It’s about a few United States senators that don’t and have their pocket books lined by millions of dollars from gun manufacturers that fund the NRA. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Muwwakkil attributes this to the previous student regents’ efforts to publicize the position and inform students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Regent Graves and Regent Weddle made a point to visit all of the campuses and to market the position space… and encouraging a lot of folks who would not have applied otherwise to engage in the process,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a member of the Black Graduate Student Association (BGSA) at UCSB and a first-generation transfer student, Muwwakkil said he took notice of the lack of representation of students of color, and more specifically, nontraditional students of color, in student governance and higher education in general. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the ways Muwwakkill addressed this issue was by helping to revive UCSB’s BGSA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Myself and a lot of other graduate students of color found that our numbers are quite low. We decided to… revitalize the existing infrastructure of the Black Graduate Student Association of UCSB,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil worked with David Stamps, a doctoral student in the Department of Communications, to reestablish the BGSA, and eventually served as the second BGSA president during the 2017-18 academic year. During this time, he began to look for more avenues to expand his advocacy work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, he reasoned the best way to make an impact while fulfilling his academic commitments was by serving as student regent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil initially applied for the position during the last application cycle but was passed over for Weddle. He will now be shadowing her as regent designate next year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil said Weddle focuses on advocating for the “basic rights of students” like “food insecurity, housing security, accessibility” as well as on other issues like Title IX regulations and sexual violence on college campuses.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to Weddle’s platform, Muwwakkil plans to bring attention to the challenges faced by nontraditional students.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we engage with leadership from each campus, we also have to be intentional to engage with students whose perspectives may very well not be represented by their leadership,” Muwwakkil said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Society does] this thing where we kind of focus in on like the 18-year-old, [and say] ‘Be stellar at 18 or no UC for you.’ I think this is a problem because there’s a lot of living that people do between the age of 18 and retirement. We need to validate the experiences of non-traditional students … within the classroom,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a transfer student from Los Angeles City College, Muwwakkil said his experience has shaped his views about accessibility for nontraditional students navigating higher education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you’re [a] first-generation student going through college, there’s a lot of guesswork that happens … You’re confused about the process, what it means to apply,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As regent designate, Muwwakkil said he first hopes to educate himself on the operations and inner workings of the Board of Regents and maneuvering the system, as well as pressing issues within the system and how these relate to students and their success.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m going to be doing a lot of fact finding and understanding what are the actual mechanisms by which things are done and accomplished; what are the prominent issues facing the UC and how the students build on their local campus level and the larger system,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During his tenure as student regent, Muwwakkil said he hopes to further the UC system’s aim in cultivating an environment that is conducive to the success of all students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Are there ways that all of these different types of students can engage in the huge bureaucracy that is the university? If that’s true for some and not for others, then we have some work to do.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Sciences Senators Ricardo Uribe and Xochitl Briseño first introduced a modification to Legal Code at the Feb. 6 Senate meeting that would codify the one-time exception process that Salari went through. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Referred to as </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Policy-36.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standing Policy 36</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the legislation would have updated Legal Code to clarify the consequences and proper procedures moving forward for senators “who [were] voted in to represent a certain sector of the student body but due to external circumstances no longer can identify with those constituents,” the policy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No longer “identify[ing] with those constituents” includes living off-campus when they were elected as on-campus senators or changing colleges as a collegiate senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Standing Policy 36, senators would have been allowed to continue serving in their positions if the Senate felt they were adequately “attending office hours, attending BCU meeting[s], attending senate meetings, and [fulfilling] their other senatorial duties outlined per legal code,” and granted them an exemption. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill was tabled for a week at the Feb. 6 meeting. All bills are required to be tabled for a week before they are voted on, per Legal Code.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the Feb. 13 meeting, several senators raised concerns about the Senate being the ones to grant an exemption, given that it is a partisan body. Standing Policy 36 was voted on and failed with nine yeses, ten noes and two abstentions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the Feb. 20 Senate meeting, Uribe and Briseno introduced another bill to update the eligibility section of Legal Code. This one, however, gave the power to grant exemptions to the Student Advocate General (S.A.G.), who runs for the position independently and is required by Legal Code to be nonpartisan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill also broadened the scope of who could receive exemptions, allowing for an elected official, including the S.A.G., to be granted an exemption for not meeting the eligibility requirements spelled out in Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this year’s S.A.G., Grecia Martinez, was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-04/s-a-g-martinez-found-in-violation-of-legal-code-by-a-g-safadi/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">found in violation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the very same portion of Legal Code by A.S. Attorney General Zeina Safadi, who released a statement on Feb. 26. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the statement, Safadi acknowledged that “the course of action regarding Ms. Martinez becomes unclear due to the fact that the requirements for elected officers start and end in that very article [of] the Legal Code.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ambiguity of the legal code on the Ms. Martinez’s case is simply a microcosm of the larger problem at hand with the text: countless incompletions and uncertain instructions that arise only when cases pertaining to such occur,” Safadi added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez maintained that she interpreted that portion of legal code as an expectation, and not an obligation, in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That bill was also </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/a-s-senate-tables-bill-to-clarify-consequences-for-elected-officials-who-dont-meet-eligibility-requirements/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tabled for a week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, per Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the Feb. 27 Senate meeting, the bill was tabled once again. Uribe said that Elections Board had reached out to him and Briseño, asking for clarification about the bill. Since neither of them could meet with the Board before the Senate meeting, they decided to postpone the vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, Uribe said he and Briseño have been unable to meet with Elections Board, particularly since all parties were busy with Spring 2019 elections. The bill has now essentially termed out, Uribe said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uribe said that he had no plans to introduce a new version of the bill at the 69th Senate’s last meeting this Wednesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt like I was the only senator who is really interested in fulfilling the bill,” Uribe said. “There were people who I knew who agreed, who would have voted for the bill and who would have definitely loved it, but just not enough people…. the way I saw it, there was not enough people to get it passed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uribe still believes that some version of this bill is necessary, and said that he hoped Senator-elect Daniel Segura-Esquivel, who he has been training, will pick up where he left off. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, Uribe said, a new bill would give senators the power to grant exemptions to executives, and vice versa, which would allow for A.S. to maintain a system of checks and balances. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he acknowledged the concerns other senators had raised about the Senate being partisan, Uribe said he didn’t believe it would be a problem because the vote would require a two-thirds majority, and one party typically does not win that many seats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without a clarification of the path forward for elected officials within A.S. who fail to meet the eligibility requirements, that portion of Legal Code will continue to be what several A.S. officials have referred to as a “gray area.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

year.<em> </em></span><em>Cameron Hsieh / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plaintiff in the most recent case, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan Lee Reyes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> v. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of California Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is UC Santa Barbara UC Police Department officer Jonathan Lee Reyes. In the suit, Reyes alleges he was retaliated against for reporting misconduct in the department relating to the retention and promotion of an unqualified police trainee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that Reyes’ whistleblowing led UCPD Lieutenant David Millard and UCPD Sergeant Gregory Smorodinsky to block Reyes from receiving a promotion to higher positions and that the two gave Reyes an unfair poor performance review.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to an individual within UCPD who asked that their name not be used, Millard is currently at a training course at the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Academy; the individual provided photographic evidence to the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Millard was there and not on the UC Santa Barbara campus as of May 9. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada was unable to comment on whether or not Millard was at the FBI academy, but could confirm that he is still an active member of the UCPD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that UCPD “retaliated against other employees based on the same protected class [as Reyes].” The suit also alleges that UCPD failed to  “discipline other employees outside [Reyes’] own protected class as severely” for the same actions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes’ lawsuit is the latest of four lawsuits filed against the department since late last year, all of which allege that the plaintiffs were retaliated against for blowing the whistle on misconduct in the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other three suits </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-07/former-officer-sues-ucpd-alleges-racism-misconduct-and-conspiracy-throughout-department/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Doe v.

UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the complaint alleges that Millard repeatedly promoted a trainee officer from lower positions despite opposition from Reyes and others in the department who were concerned about the trainee’s performance. Reyes alleges he brought concerns forward to Millard multiple times, including when the trainee was first assigned to Reyes and later when Millard announced the trainee had completed Field Training Officer (FTO) training. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case alleges that Millard’s approval to promote the unqualified trainee created “a threat to the safety of the public and the University” and violated <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=832\">California Penal Code 832</a>, which states that “a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">peace officer shall satisfactorily complete an introductory training course.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The allegations in court documents begin in June 2017, when Reyes was assigned as an FTO with the trainee. Court documents say that after Millard announced in an email that the trainee will advance to the next phase, Reyes, along with several other officers, objected the promotion, pointing to “multiple evaluations by FTO’s [which] indicated that the trainee was failing,” court documents allege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite an FTO’s recommendation for the trainee’s termination and the trainee’s failure to pass a program from the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards Training (P.O.S.T.) — the body responsible for creating law enforcement training requirements — Lieutenant Millard “successfully released [the trainee] from FTO training,” court documents allege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes then allegedly emailed the region coordinator for P.O.S.T. to relay his concerns about the failing trainee. Millard later met with Reyes and accused him of “not following an order” to promote the trainee, court documents allege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In August 2017, Reyes was denied a promotion to corporal, despite being “better qualified for the position than other candidates selected for the position,” court documents state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, in September 2017, Reyes applied for a position as a sergeant but was again denied the promotion in March 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes alleges that he did not receive these positions, despite his qualifications, due to retaliation from Millard regarding the trainee. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit also alleges that Reyes’ poor performance review from 2018 was another result of the department’s retaliation, this time from Smorodinsky “under the direction of [Millard].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Court documents state “the review was very critical” and omitted “various positive things throughout the year.” Reyes submitted a grievance to the department “which detailed each point in his review that he felt was inaccurate or unwarranted,” and his review was later overturned in response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The allegations in the suit involve a handful of other officers as well, including former Police Chief Dustin Olson, former Assistant Chief Cathy Farley, Sergeant Gregory Pierce and Sergeant Rory Sheehey, who are named in the other cases as well. However, none of the aforementioned officers are being sued in Reyes’ case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three of the four cases filed since November 2018, including </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes v. UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, are represented by the same law firm, Richie Litigation, based in Los Angeles. Antonio Castillo, a lawyer handling the cases from Richie Litigation, said in an email that the three cases “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are exposing long-term systemic systems of bullying and the suppression of the advancement of minority police officers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ryan Smith, the plaintiff in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Doe v. UC Regents, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is the only officer of the five who worked with a different attorney, Peter Horton, to file his claim. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuits brought forward by Reyes, Signa and the Littles are steps toward addressing the department’s alleged misconduct, according to Castillo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That these brave officers have come forward and inspired many more to do so means that we finally have an opportunity to make real progress in changing how the UCSB Police Department operates,” Castillo said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the May 30, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
