Cal Poly was able to regularly test the Gaucho defense and took five shots in the half, forcing UCSB’s goal keeper Alan Carrillo to make some incredible saves.</p>\n<p>The freshman keeper turned away a near score in the 61st minute; the result of a well serviced cross from the left side of the box and a well-placed shot that Carrillo was able to dive in front of. In the final 10 minutes of the match, Carrillo found himself having to stop a high shot to the top left of the net that he incredibly punched away and out of play. The conclusion of regulation play left the match scoreless, forcing the third double overtime match in the month of October for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly was able to pose another goal scoring threat yet again in the first OT period, sending a free kick ball into the box that was headed on target, but Carrillo was able to strike it down. The ball was then sent off the left post on a shot off of the save which Carrillo promptly got on top of.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos just could not find the offensive rhythm that they had in their victories earlier in conference play. The defensive play from UCSB was also concerning as from the start of the second half in regulation, Cal Poly was able to take control and create their own chances for shots on goal. The shaky defense from the Gauchos forced their keeper Carrillo to stand on his head throughout the match, keeping the team within range to win the game.</p>\n<p>“I think we were only able to break once and within five seconds there five players on top of us,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “The rest of the time our center backs are at midfield looking into ten players and knowing that if you make a bad pass then you’re open on the right and the left and that’s when Alan made those two saves.”</p>\n<p>While exciting, the Gauchos were certainly hoping for a better result from the Blue-Green rivalry as they ended the week of play with a 0-1-1 record.</p>\n<p>The UCSB men’s soccer team found themselves heading into this week’s play with a full head of steam. The six game unbeaten streak for the club allowed the squad to climb the conference standings early in the season, bringing the team to the top of the North division, three points ahead of UC Davis, with ten points.</p>\n<p>The position the Gauchos find themselves at the conclusion of this week’s play is now second in the North division, two points behind UC Davis, with 11 points.</p>\n<p>The team is now finding themselves in a place of adversity. After two challenging games, the Gauchos will now face the challenge of making another climb up the standings with only four games remaining in the regular season. The Gauchos don’t need to run the table, but they do need to get enough favorable results in the remaining matches to get/stay ahead of UC Davis, who are looking like a threat to UCSB’s plans of taking the conference crown.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg referenced the youth off the team saying, “We got to the top of the box and shot where we have one more pass to make and we didn’t do it. It’s young, it’s inexperience, it’s the crowd, and we just need someone who can handle the ball well.”</p>\n<p>The play from the young group of freshmen on the team, goalkeeper Alan Carrillo, forward Sahid Conteh and forward Rodney Michael, has been key to the Gaucho’s success this season.</p>\n<p>However, the team has been shutout twice in their last two games and have a three game winless streak. The addition of junior Joseph Ammer, who has been out since September 15th with an injury, can fully complete the offense and has the team waiting for his return to the pitch headed into the late season push.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play their next game on the road against the Sacramento State Hornets on Wednesday, Oct. 18 at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79127\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-16/part-one-of-blue-green-rivalry-ends-in-a-draw/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79127\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-16/part-one-of-blue-green-rivalry-ends-in-a-draw/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-16/part-one-of-blue-green-rivalry-ends-in-a-draw/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-16/part-one-of-blue-green-rivalry-ends-in-a-draw/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-16/part-one-of-blue-green-rivalry-ends-in-a-draw/","id":1377,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1376,1375,1374],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez","biography":"Not available","articles":[45,52,64,67,68,69,71,1111,1132,1136,1160,1162,1165,1169,1170,1172,1197,1201,1202,1204,1205,1377,1380,1383,1388,1399,1497,1921,3342,4097,4106,4111,4266,4268,4270,4273,4274,4282,4287,4819,4822,4828,4889,4891,4892,4893],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Hot Fuzz, Cold Beers and Open Containers","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2007-08-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The anticipation is palpable in the Isla Vista Foot Patrol office as more and more officers file into the room.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The anticipation is palpable in the Isla Vista Foot Patrol office as more and more officers file into the room. Friday, Aug. 24 marks the weekend before Santa Barbara City College starts its fall session. In response, the police force charged with keeping order in the square mile that has become infamous for its parties has upped its numbers to 16 officers on foot and several “rover” units in squad cars.</p>\n<p>At 10 p.m. the deputies and officers leave the station and break into several large groups consisting of about five men each and head toward the infamous Del Playa Drive. All conversation halts and eye contact is avoided as students pass by the officers. Partiers on the decks of houses above can be heard muttering, “Uh oh, there’s the police, what time is it?” in a bid to avoid a ticket for violating Santa Barbara County’s midnight noise curfew.</p>\n<p>Ninety percent of all crime in I.V. is alcohol-related. Fear, however, is not necessary according to IVFP deputy Isaiah Tchobanoff. He said if you just follow the rules you can have both a social life and a clean record.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Ignorance is no excuse,” Tchobanoff said. “You have responsibility as students to know the laws.”</p>\n<p><b>All of It?</b></p>\n<p>Three young men walk down the 6500 block of DP carrying two cases of beer while drinking some. They see the cops and begin speed walking, but to no avail. Tchobanoff instructs them to sit down on the curb while he begins to gather their information. One of the men does not have an ID so he tells Tchobanoff his details.</p>\n<p>At the scene, Sergeant Daniel Massey explains the consequences of these actions as he watches one sullen young man on the curb with his Coors beer.</p>\n<p>“If what he says is true then he’ll be given a ticket and sent on his way – after pouring out all the beer,” Massey said.</p>\n<p>Two of the young men are issued infractions for open containers. If the men were under 21, they would have received a minor in possession citation, which is a misdemeanor. An MIP penalty is more serious than an infraction and results in a mandatory court appearance where the judge can pick from a plethora of punishments to bestow upon the lawbreaker. These men, however, are of legal age and so they are given their tickets and instructed to pour out all of the beer.</p>\n<p>While the two are still soaking the ground with suds, another young man walks onto the street talking on his cell phone with a beer in the other hand. In a matter of seconds he is plopped down next to our current offenders crying, “Wait, I was just in there. I came out to talk on my cell phone!”</p>\n<p>Too late. Officers can issue open container citations in places with public access like the street, the sidewalk and even some driveways. The infraction carries a $108 fine.</p>\n<p>All these gentlemen could have easily avoided the tickets if they had just waited to enjoy that Rocky Mountain taste indoors.</p>\n<p><b>Dude, Where’s My Gas Cap?</b></p>\n<p>Near the end of the 6500 block of DP, officers catch a young man tampering with an Isuzu parked along the street. The man has removed the gas cap and placed it on the top of the car. An officer takes the man’s driver license and begins reviewing the information when both officers suddenly take off running to break up a potential fight down the block. The vehicular hooligan cries out to his friends standing in the shadows across the street, “Should I run? He has my ID! Should I run?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!” cheer his friends but just as the young man leans forward to run, the officers return, none too happy upon observing his attempt of flight. The owner of the Isuzu is retrieved from the house behind, briefed of the situation and asked if he would like to press charges. The irate Isuzu driver enthusiastically proclaims, “I am so sick of people messing with my car. Yeah, I wanna press charges!”</p>\n<p>The offender begins to babble that he was just pulling a prank and that all sorts of people have screwed with his car in the past. The officers explain that it is no excuse for messing with a stranger’s vehicle and that they have no idea if the removal of the gas cap was all the young man would have done. The young man is charged with vehicle tampering, which is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine, imprisonment or both. The young man is placed in handcuffs and walked to a police car.</p>\n<p><b>The White Rubber Gloves</b></p>\n<p>Around 1:30 a.m., a large group of IVFP deputies and officers are standing in front of the 6500 DP beach access when a young man stumbles to the top of the stairs from the salty scented darkness below. The man is extremely intoxicated and appears suspicious. The officers now have probable cause to search him.</p>\n<p>This quickly leads to a classic “spread ’em” situation against a police car. Two officers put on white rubber gloves. One officer searches the man and hands whatever he finds to the other. The sea-loving drunkard has a round, silver flask full of dark alcohol. The liquor is poured out and the man is handcuffed and taken to the county jail for public intoxication. Once the man has sobered up, police will release him and he may receive some additional fines.</p>\n<p>Generally, courts will mandate that first-time offenders under 21 enroll in the Youth Offender Program. Penalties can include fines, the suspension of one’s driver license for one year and mandatory alcohol classes. In addition, UCSB may send a letter home to one’s parents detailing the violation.</p>\n<p>As far as I.V. weekends go, this particular night is actually uneventful. Police gave 25 citations and made two arrests, most of which were for open containers. Carrying an open container down DP is like playing Russian roulette and the safest way to win is not to play. The mistakes made by these rabble-rousers are easily avoided if you party as smart as you party hard.</p>\n<p>Sidebar:<br>\nGeneral Guidelines for Citation-Free Partying<br>\n1. Always carry your cups upside-down to show you have no booze and the IVFP will have no reason to stop you.<br>\n2. After midnight on weekends and ten on weekdays, music cannot be audible from 100 feet over a property line or you can get a noise infraction that comes with a $108 fine.<br>\n3. Walk your bike to avoid a BUI. That’s biking under the influence and although it may seem fun at the time, if convicted, you’ll have to go to court and possibly pay a fine of $1,300 and have your driver license suspended for a year.<br>\n4. Don’t carry an open container!<br>\n5. If you’re under 21, even carrying a closed container of alcohol for someone else can get you a citation.<br>\n6. Holding hands with 12 other people will not save you from getting in trouble if you’re intoxicated.<br>\n7. Don’t lie or mouth off to the IVFP.<br>\n8. Don’t attract attention to yourself by running, yelling or picking a fight.<br>\n9. Don’t take off your shoes or sit down on the curb. It’s usually a sign that you’re intensely intoxicated and an officer will probably approach you.<br>\n10. Always party with friends who will watch out for your safety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-14431\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-08-29/hot-fuzz-cold-beers-and-open-containers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-14431\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-08-29/hot-fuzz-cold-beers-and-open-containers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-08-29/hot-fuzz-cold-beers-and-open-containers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-08-29/hot-fuzz-cold-beers-and-open-containers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-08-29/hot-fuzz-cold-beers-and-open-containers/","id":1374,"author":{"id":340,"name":"Lauren Crecelius"},"related":[1373,1372,1371],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"1-0 Gauchos Shut Out St. Johns for First Regular Season Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2018-08-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/10-22-MSoccer-SLO-EricSwensonNexus-19-web-e1535228411958.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/10-22-MSoccer-SLO-EricSwensonNexus-19-web-e1535228411958.jpg?resize=900%2C601&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos are now 1-0 in regular season play following their shutout win at home against St. John's on Friday.

Though Santa Barbara out-shot its competitor 6-3 during the dry spell, the closest the team got to scoring came at the hands—or rather, feet— of junior forward Noah Billingsley whose shot was blocked by opposing goalie Lenny Wilson in the 22nd minute. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, following a pivotal substitution replacing Rodney Michael with the freshman Clemmenson, the Gauchos finally secured a lead in the 40th minute. Off a throw in delivered by defender Hunter Ashworth, Clemmenson headed the ball into the back of the net.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Debuting in the first season game of his career at Santa Barbara, the Gatorade Arizona Player of the Year made his transition into collegiate play look second-nature. With two goals and an assist across last week’s exhibition match and this season opener, Clemmenson’s integration so far into the Gaucho frontline feels seamless. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s offensive control continued into the second half, leaving the Red Storm shot-less for the next almost thirty minutes while they attempted to score twice more. In the 70th minute, sophomore forward Rodney Michael scored the ninth goal of his UCSB career in a breakaway assisted by teammate Sahid Conteh.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79357\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-21-17_1-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1094744733\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83902\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79357\" data-attachment-id=\"79357\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-drop-season-finale-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly-earn-no-2-seed-for-big-west-tournament/menssoccer_christinademarzo_10-21-17_1-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-21-17_1-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1356&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1356\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-21-17_1-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-21-17_1-web.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-21-17_1-web.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-79357\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-21-17_1-web-1024x678.jpg?resize=888%2C588\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"588\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-21-17_1-web.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-21-17_1-web.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-21-17_1-web.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-21-17_1-web.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-21-17_1-web.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79357\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rodney Michael pushes the ball past defenders. Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With five major collegiate accolades behind him including 2017 College Soccer News All-Freshman First Team and 2017 Big West Freshman of the Year, the Sierra Leone native shows a steadfast command of the field and a fluid coherence with his teammates. His performance against St. John’s only reaffirms his vital presence on the roster. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Red Storm responded to their competitor’s goal, however, almost immediately. Tani Oluwaseyi, one of the seven St. John’s members to make their D1 debut that game, took a threatening shot on goal just seconds after his opponent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a true rookie vs. rookie face-off, Gaucho Ben Roach blocked Oluwaseyi’s attempt, a save that earned him and the rest of the Santa Barbara their first shutout of the season. Standing in goal the entire game, Roach deflected each of the total two shots on goal sent by the Red Storm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this type of rookie-and-returner chemistry and an opening shutout to show for it, the 2018 season looks promising for Santa Barbara. The Gauchos have little time for dwelling on their victory, however, as they make a quick return tomorrow, Sunday, August 26, against UC Riverside at Harder Stadium. The game will start at 7:00pm as UCSB will aim to continue their early-season momentum. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

team’s 3-1 dub against long-time conference competitor UC Riverside; however, the game doubles as the 250th win of his 20-year career, making it more of a milestone than just a step in the right direction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last night’s win kept the Gauchos’ record spotless at 2-0 while their fellow California-based opponents took yet another hit, sending them to a 0-2 overall count. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two UC’s met twice last year in conference play, the second time ending in a sore 0-1 loss in Big West quarterfinals that knocked Santa Barbara out of the running for the championship. As Vom Steeg described in last night’s post-game press conference, this year’s victorious outcome constituted just one part of the ongoing “redemption tour” that has so far defined the 2018 season. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though familiar with their competitor, it wasn’t until the 37th minute that the Gauchos caught up to the Highlanders’ seemingly unpredictable gameplay and made their mark offensively. The play began with a free kick taken from the left side by junior Thibault Candia. Frontman Sahid Conteh, posted opposite of his counterpart, caught the rebound off the goalie’s initial save and crossed the ball into the box where Faozi Taeb headed it into the net. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The junior transfer’s goal unleashed an unrelenting attack on the Highlanders. UCSB’s defense remained solid throughout the game and seldom allowed the opposing attackers quality chances on goal. Their outstanding coverage ensured routine saves for the unchallenged goalie Ben Roach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, UCSB’s offense offered little reprieve to the UC Riverside roster. Santa Barbara increased its passing through the midfield, seamlessly transitioning the ball from one player to another as each maneuvered their way through their opponent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took just ten minutes for Candia to play a pass to midfielder Joseph Ammer who sent it up the field to freshman Carter Clemmenson. Facing away from the goal above the 18 yard box, Clemmenson broke the defenders with a one-touch that allowed him to launch the ball over the goalie’s head.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If not for midfielder Daniel Aguirre’s last minute goal, the Gauchos’ offense would have gone unmatched. Perhaps the most dangerous attacking player on UCR’s roster, the sophomore took advantage of a lapse in defense, sending a powerful 20 yard shot that cleared the inside of the post and cut UCSB’s lead in half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once again, however, Santa Barbara reasserted itself. With minutes left in the game, Axel Mendez, a senior midfielder, fooled the UCR defenders in what seemed like a routine way to kill time. Instead, Mendez took the ball along the end line and played it beautifully into his new teammate Migel Gomez, firing a headline-worthy goal into the top left net in the 90th minute. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is this baseline cohesiveness that has so far been vital to the the Gaucho’s success. Stacked with 10 returners and four or so solid newcomers, the 2018 roster is a rarity and a luxury at its core. Able to substitute player for player without compromise—replacing Billingsley with Clemmenson, for example—Coach Vom Steeg sees huge potential for the upcoming season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Santa Barbara prepares to take the road for their first away games of the season this week. The team will face stiff competitors Portland and Seattle University each of whom will test the Gauchos’ early success. The weekend kicks off at the Nike Portland International on Friday August 31 at 7pm. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83918\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-27/early-success-continues-ucsb-defeats-uc-riverside-3-1-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83918\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-27/early-success-continues-ucsb-defeats-uc-riverside-3-1-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-27/early-success-continues-ucsb-defeats-uc-riverside-3-1-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-27/early-success-continues-ucsb-defeats-uc-riverside-3-1-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-27/early-success-continues-ucsb-defeats-uc-riverside-3-1-at-home/","id":1375,"author":{"id":283,"name":"Annika Pearson"},"related":[1374,1373,1372],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
