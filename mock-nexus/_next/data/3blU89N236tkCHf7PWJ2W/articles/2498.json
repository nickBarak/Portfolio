Gov Gavin Newsom proposed a 14-point plan to aid student-athletes academically.</p></div>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara attained a student-athlete graduation success rate of 82 percent in the 2014-2015 school year, according to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) website. The graduation success rate takes into account student-athletes who leave UCSB in good standing or graduate elsewhere.</p>\n<p>UCSB already has many of the policies called for in Newsom’s proposal, which would require that athletes who sustain career-ending injuries be able to retain their scholarships until graduation.</p>\n<p>The plan would also prevent coaches from having the authority to deny or admit student-athletes and limit practice time to no more than 20 hours a week.</p>\n<p>Additionally, administrations on UC campuses would have increased involvement in athletic departments and student-athletes would be required to meet with academic counselors regularly if the plan passes.</p>\n<p>Bill Mahoney, UCSB associate athletics director of communications, said each team decides if student-athletes keep their scholarships after sustaining career-ending injuries. He said the UCSB athletics department does not currently mandate this decision for all teams.</p>\n<p>Mahoney also said UCSB coaches have no say in admissions decisions for student-athletes. Freshman student-athletes are required to meet with academic counselors and each team requires its student-athletes to attend study halls on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>The athletics department abides by the NCAA rule limiting team practices to a maximum of 20 hours per week, according to Mahoney. Practices can exceed this limit, he said, only when school is not in session.</p>\n<p>While he recognized that many UC campuses are currently implementing many of the proposed policies, Newsom said the UC system should “lead the nation in reform” with his 14-point plan.</p>\n<p>“A lot of this is already being done, so it’s nice to codify it,” Newsom said.<br>\nGabe Vincent, a guard on UCSB’s basketball team and second-year religious studies major, said he and other student-athletes struggle to balance school and sports despite many of these policies aimed at upholding athletes’ academic performance.</p>\n<p>Vincent said he often worries that he will not graduate in four years, especially since he feels forced by his schedule to take only 12 or 13 units each quarter.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s definitely a worry,” Vincent said. “You’re expected to put the same amount of work and same amount of time [into school], but there’s a big block of your day that’s just taken out.”</p><div

eight of its residence halls.</p>\n<p>Over 98 percent of current freshmen live in residence halls, and the university hopes to make more housing available for all students as part of an <a href=\"http://ucop.edu/student-housing-initiative/\">initiative</a> authored by the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) in January.</p>\n<p>This year, all continuing students were able to apply for residency in Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, San Miguel and San Nicholas halls, which have traditionally housed freshman students. The five residence halls, along with Manzanita Village and Santa Catalina Hall will be increasing the amount of triple rooms for the next academic year.</p>\n<p>According to the UCSB residence hall contract for the upcoming academic year, Santa Catalina Hall will convert the highest number of rooms, beginning fall 2016 with 975 students living in triples. Santa Catalina Hall currently has 157 triple spaces, according to Mario Muñoz, associate director of Resident Placement &amp; Assignment Services.</p>\n<p>During a UC Regents meeting on Tuesday, chief financial officer Nathan Brostrom presented strategies to expedite the development of student housing, mentioning UCSB’s increased triples as an example of a campus-specific housing solution.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s enrollment has decreased after hitting its peak in 2014, students in an undergraduate population of 20,607 still struggle to find housing on campus and in Isla Vista. According to the report, over 500 students are on UCSB’s housing waitlist, with almost 15,000 students on waitlists UC-wide.</p>\n<p>UCOP’s housing initiative aims to introduce 14,000 new beds across all UC campuses by 2020 and approximately 3,800 spaces have been created since January.</p>\n<p>“The UC has housed over 34,000 students in the past year,” Bergstrom said, “Given the size and scope of this initiative, there is no one-size-fits-all model.”</p>\n<p>Nivi Lakshminarayanan, incoming first-year pre-psychology and brain sciences major, selected her first choices for housing as Santa Cruz and Anacapa Hall.</p>\n<p>“I think it’ll definitely be different, since right now I just live in my own room at my house,” she said. “I always imagined living in a double whenever I thought of college so this is definitely a change.”</p>\n<p>Many freshmen, such as Thomas Crimmel, incoming first-year geography major, select their housing based on affordability.</p>\n<p>“I was originally considering a double, but the extra 2,000 dollars a year that came along with that double definitely encouraged me to seek out a third roommate.”</p>\n<p>Housing contracts for continuing students were due in early February, and Housing &amp; Residential Services will begin deciding spaces for students who have enrolled after the freshman contract deadline on May 15.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/300-dorms-to-become-triples/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/300-dorms-to-become-triples/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/300-dorms-to-become-triples/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/300-dorms-to-become-triples/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-11/300-dorms-to-become-triples/","id":2497,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2496,2495,2494],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Campus a Haven for Birdwatchers","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BIRDS-Photo-Courtesy-of-Christopher-Diel-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BIRDS-Photo-Courtesy-of-Christopher-Diel-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Tom Turner recently pointed his telescope toward the ocean at Coal Oil Point and saw a “river of birds,” counting over 10,000 Pacific loons in 20 minutes.

Migratory birds travel some or all of this distance twice a year, in search of either suitable breeding areas or more food and hospitable climates.</p>\n<p>There are also many species of birds that live on UC Santa Barbara’s campus year-round due to the mild climate, such as mallards in the pool near Storke Tower, mockingbirds on the University Center lawn and American crows at the library.</p>\n<p>“Given the habitats we have here, no other major university campus in North America has as many bird species as UCSB,” said Steve Rothstein, research professor of ecology, evolution and marine biology. “If people are going to go birdwatching in Santa Barbara County, they will go out of their way to go to Campus Lagoon and Devereaux Slough.”</p>\n<p>Graduate student Devyn Orr teaches a vertebrae zoology laboratory, a class that takes students birdwatching throughout campus and Goleta. According to Orr, 495 of the 600 species of birds documented in California have been seen in Santa Barbara County, and 209 of them can be seen on campus.</p>\n<p>“That’s a third of all species documented in the state!” Orr said in an email. “Considering how small our campus is — 1.6 square miles — relative to all 163,696 square miles of California, we host an astounding diversity of species.”</p>\n<p>Orr said the bird species on campus include common species like mourning doves, western gulls, crows and mockingbirds, which tend to be comfortable living near people and live on campus all year.</p>\n<p>The migrating species can be small and drab, while others are bright and exotic, like western tanagers and blue grosbeaks. Shorebirds like snowy plovers scurry around on the beaches, while birds of prey like ospreys, white-tailed kites and northern harriers can often be seen in the skies over campus.</p>\n<p>The variety and number of bird species on campus has changed in the last 30 years, according to Rothstein.</p>\n<p>He said there were once many more large eucalyptus trees between the residence halls and Campus Lagoon where great blue herons nested, many of which have since been cut down. Rothstein said quail disappeared from the campus when much of the brush along sidewalks was cleared for safety purposes.</p>\n<p>However, Rothstein added that campus birds are not necessarily in trouble.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that there’s been a big decline in bird species,” he said. “Things have changed a bit, but there are some species that we see more of and some that we don’t see anymore. Overall, things have been holding pretty steady.”</p>\n<p>Birds can influence seed availability and insect abundance, and meat-eating birds can help regulate the other animals’ population or make sure they decompose quickly when they die. According to Orr, climate change, land conversion, non-native species and disease can threaten bird populations and can make it challenging for them to fully carry out their natural roles.</p>\n<p>“Their loss goes beyond aesthetics, and may indirectly impact our own health and well-being,” Orr said.</p>\n<p>Jasen Liu, first-year College of Creative Studies biology major, said he was surprised few people notice the number of birds on campus.</p>\n<p>“It’s crazy how no one notices how many birds there are here, especially after the winter rains, when the colorful overwintering warblers feed en masse on bugs in the lawn or when large flocks of beautiful Cedar Waxwings fill the Ficus trees when they’re in fruit,” Liu said in an email. “So essentially I would want someone who knows nothing about birds on campus to know that well, there are a shit ton present and that it is always worth it to look skywards.”</p>\n<p>Rothstein has taught a vertebrate zoology course for 41 years and said past students have approached him at birdwatcher gatherings to tell him what a profound impact the course had on them. Rothstein said people are drawn to birdwatching because, like humans, birds sense the world primarily through vision and hearing.</p>\n<p>“Unlike most mammals, we don’t have a good olfactory sense,” Rothstein said. “If we were like most mammals, we wouldn’t go birdwatching — we would go mammal sniffing.”</p>\n<p>Amanda Orens, third-year zoology major who has taken Rothstein’s class, said she thinks students would benefit from noticing the birds on campus and would understand why their presence at UCSB is so unique.</p>\n<p>“It’s when students stop seeing all of the birds on campus as just

projects to mitigate the ecological impact of construction.</p>\n<p>Lisa Stratton, director of ecosystem management at Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration, has been working there since 2005, analyzing impacts of development projects, writing grants for restoration funding and communicating with officials on campus about mitigation efforts.</p>\n<p>According to Stratton, the university carries out the restoration projects because of policies included in the Coastal Act and the Clean Water Act.</p>\n<p>“Generally the goal of the Coastal Commission is to preserve and avoid impacts,” Stratton wrote in an email on Wednesday. “If that cannot be avoided, then minimize impacts and as a final, least desired alternative, impact the resource and do restoration somewhere else.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s 2015 Princeton Review ranking as the No. 1 Green College amongst public universities stands as a “point of pride” on the school website, and the recent construction of Manzanita Village won the Santa Barbara Sustainability Award in 2005.</p>\n<p>When the university plans to develop and potentially damage the environment of an area, they must reserve an equal area for mitigation purposes, as explained in Section 30607.1 of the California Coastal Act. “Where any dike and fill development is permitted in wetlands […] mitigation measures shall include, at a minimum, either acquisition of equivalent areas of equal or greater biological productivity or opening up equivalent areas to tidal action.”</p>\n<p>For the university, the ‘“equivalent areas of equal or greater biological productivity’” are handed over to CCBER for mitigation. Apart from the Manzanita Village and Lagoon Park, current CCBER management areas include the San Clemente wetland, the lot 38 bioswale, North Bluff and the Campus Lagoon.</p>\n<p>“Manzanita impacted a very small amount of wetland habitat and created a six-acre restoration area as mitigation along the bluff and lagoon edges,” Stratton says. Past projects, on the other hand, have not been so gentle. “North Campus Faculty housing worked around a bunch over very low quality wetlands and graded them and protected them with reduced, 25-foot buffers within the housing development plus did some mitigation on South Parcel.”</p>\n<p>This kind of environmental degradation does not go without consequences. “A total of about 25 acres of restoration is happening because of faculty housing,” Stratton adds.</p>\n<p>Manzanita’s six acres and North Campus Faculty housing’s 25, coupled with six acres of mitigation from San Clemente and three from San Joaquin, constitutes the mitigation aspect of CCBER’s restoration work on campus, according to Stratton. The total comes to about 40 acres.</p>\n<p>For Stratton, the job takes an optimistic turn in light of the positive educational and environmental change she and her colleagues create. “CCBER manages about 250 of campus’s 1000 acres, and integrates hundreds of students in our work each year as employees, interns and volunteers who help with research and restoration.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, May 5, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70699\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/ucsb-takes-on-40-acres-of-restoration/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70699\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/ucsb-takes-on-40-acres-of-restoration/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/ucsb-takes-on-40-acres-of-restoration/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/ucsb-takes-on-40-acres-of-restoration/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/ucsb-takes-on-40-acres-of-restoration/","id":2495,"author":{"id":112,"name":"Natalie Overton"},"related":[2494,2493,2492],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
