","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>January is a special time of the year for many. Some enjoy its signaling of new beginnings, while others enjoy the chance to leave the past behind them. But there is more than the spirit of rebirth that makes this month memorable. A notable holiday that honors a pioneer of peace as well as his steps towards equality.</p>\n<p>The nation paid tribute to civil and social rights activist Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the inaugural anniversary of MLK Day. A man of civil integrity, peace and nonviolence, King’s vision has not only carried over to the boundaries of social justice but also to the professional sports stage like the NBA.</p>\n<p>The National Basketball Association honored this Southern humanitarian last Monday, Jan. 18, hosting four nationally televised games in honor of his memory. As all the teams wore gray warm-up shirts saying “MLK,” this day really hit home for one specific team, the Memphis Grizzlies.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A city that first handedly experienced the works of this peace promoter, the Bluff State hosted their 13<sup>th</sup> annual MLK Day matchup. In a packed FedEx Forum Arena with roughly over 18,000 in attendance, Grizzlies fans paid homage to a figure whose leadership permeated the streets of Tennessee.</p>\n<p>In April of 1968, King traveled to Memphis supporting a coalition of African-American workers and their fight for equal working conditions. King was a steady activist for the Memphis Sanitation Strike addressing this poor treatment and racial discrimination clearly to then-city mayor Henry Loeb.</p>\n<p>Following his infamous “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop” speech, King checked into the local Lorraine Hotel, now the National Civil Rights Museum. This was where the abolitionist lived his final days as he was assassinated on April 4, 1968. While King’s death marked the end of the 39-year olds civil activism, to this day his presence lives on for the people of Memphis as well as within the Grizzlies organization.</p>\n<p>Starting guard Tony Allen acknowledged how Dr. King stood for more than just social equality, but also for athletes like himself to continue their passion of sports. “Martin Luther King paved the way for guys like myself to have the opportunity to be around now, Allen told NBA reporter Mark Jones. “It felt good to be honoring [this man] and playing on this day.”</p>\n<p>Grizzly big man Zach Randolph also touched on MLK’s special day stating, “What [King] did for us was to give us freedom, someway or somehow. Racism still exists in this world today, but he was a leader and he showed other African-Americans that they could be anything they wanted to be and they could speak from their heart and live the dream and do the right thing,” Randolph told USA Today. “Nobody can tell you what to do and you believe in yourself.”</p>\n<p>What stood as a regulatory match between two NBA teams spoke volumes to the city of Memphis, a region who shared the memories of Dr. King and his civil quest for freedom. His dream and passions still live on through MLK day.</p>\n<p>His vision has given basketball an essence of peace, the ability to experience the passions and competitive spirit of a sport with others regardless of their ethnicity or skin tone. Dr. King will continue to hold a thriving legacy through the Grizzlies’ classic MLK Day match, giving others, both athletes and NBA fans, the encouragement to “Dream BIG”.</p>\n<p></p><div

For people like me, Kobe <em>was</em> life.</p>\n<p>My first memory as a toddler was my mother teaching me to say “please” when asking for my bottle. After that, all I remember is the number eight, the coolest afro I’ve ever seen and Chick Hearn’s magnificent voice saying “Slaaaam dunk!”</p>\n<p>The first videogame I ever remember playing was “Kobe Bryant in NBA Courtside” for the Nintendo 64. I can still see the first tip-off I ever took part in with the computer’s David Robinson rising high over my Shaquille O’Neal because I didn’t know the buttons yet at the age of four.</p>\n<p>The first Christmas present I ever remember getting was a mini basketball hoop which I played on all day, every day, annoying the crap out of my sisters while I pretended I was Kobe and practiced his moves.</p>\n<p>When I started Kindergarten, my dad told me he would take me to the front row of a Laker game if I learned how to read. It took me about three weeks. What more motivation did I need?</p>\n<p>For the game, I made a poster that said, “Kobe, 360 for me.” He did. And he winked at me after.</p>\n<p>Over the years, my range of emotions became one with the rises and falls of Kobe and the Lakers. Life had its own stresses and challenges, but I only ever experienced true heartbreak or happiness when I was watching him play.</p>\n<p>It meant everything to me. His success was my success, his embarrassments were my embarrassments.</p>\n<p>I’m not one to cry very often, but when Kobe hit those two shots against Phoenix in Game Four of the first round in 2006, I ran around the house screaming as an ocean of tears fell from my eyes.</p>\n<p>How many of us have had to read the YouTube comments on Kobe’s top career plays only to see people asking, “Why is this number one? It was in the first round and they lost the series.” If you ever had to ask that, then you’ll never know.</p>\n<p>When the Lakers defeated the Orlando Magic in the 2009 NBA Finals, giving Kobe his first ring without Shaq, I smiled, teary-eyed, as I reflected upon the long, stressful road to that moment. I remembered where I was during every second of his career: what I was up to in school, who my friends were at the time, the sheer happiness I felt from seeing him hit shot after shot to bring his team back over and over again. It’s all one and the same.</p>\n<p>If there is a reason why I’m able to remember so much about my life growing up, it’s because Kobe made just about every day something worth remembering.</p>\n<p>If there is a reason why I’m writing this article today, it’s because he showed me that loving sports is more than just a hobby. For those with true passion, it is a lifestyle.</p>\n<p>He taught me how to hope, how to care, how to want something and how to go get it no matter who’s standing in the way. He taught me how to be an asshole on the court, he taught me to be a ballhog and he taught me how to win. He set the bar so high that even when I excelled in anything, I felt I needed to do better.</p>\n<p>Numbers never meant a damn thing to Kobe. He never wanted to play by anyone’s rules other than his own, and, thank God, he never did. All he ever wanted was to win, and for a good while, he was the best at it.</p>\n<p>People can bring up all the shooting percentages, stats and figures they want, but the fact is, when Kobe was on the court, that was what made the Lakers, well … the Lakers. He embodied everything that was great about the greatest organization in basketball.</p>\n<p>Ever since he tore his Achilles back in 2013, I’ve felt like I’ve been missing something. It might sound stupid, but life no longer makes sense the way it used to. We’ve been fearing the end of his career for so long, but now that it’s finally here, I’m still not sure how I can possibly accept it. Rooting for him is all I’ve ever known.</p>\n<p>Yeah, it hurts to see him play the way he’s playing right now. It hurts to hear him admitting defeat after games. I don’t enjoy watching him shoot 1-14 one night, listen to him talk about how bad he played and how much pain he’s in, then see him go 4-20 a few nights later.</p>\n<p>But if there’s one thing I’ve loved about Kobe all these years, it’s that no matter what anyone says or thinks, he will always be Kobe. “He shoots too much.” “He needs to learn how to pass.” “He’s not a good leader.” We heard it back in 1999 before the Lakers won three straight championships, we heard it back in 2006 when his starting lineup included Kwame Brown and Smush Parker and we heard it in 2010 when he was still winning championships.</p>\n<p>So who cares if people are still saying it today?</p>\n<p>Most of the athletes who have reached out to honor Kobe since his announcement have all sent messages revolving around the same theme: how much he has inspired them. His work ethic is legendary, his ability to get the job done against all odds is legendary. His fire, ferocity and killer nature will go down in history as possibly the greatest ever.</p>\n<p>The media can say what it wants, but the league’s current stars are the ones who grew up watching him play. They’re the ones who battled and lost to him time and time again, hoping to someday surpass his shadow. And they’re the ones who have spoken up to give him the admiration he deserves.</p>\n<p>Kobe is the last link between what the NBA was and what it is now. He is the bridge between the Michael Jordan era, basketball of the 90s and the end of Showtime, to whatever the hell we see out there today with free-throws, weak fouls and three-pointers filling up the box scores.</p>\n<p>He is the last of a dying breed that will be extinct by the end of this season. He is tradition.</p>\n<p>If he doesn’t make a shot the rest of his life, let’s just enjoy watching him while we can. Few people in the basketball world have had the kind of impact that a man like Kobe Bryant has. Few teams have been spoiled the way Laker fans have been all these years.</p>\n<p>Kobe Bryant has been both the NBA’s greatest enemy and greatest hero.

Eric Swenson/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Balance is an integral facet of life, particularly if you are a student-athlete. Finding a way to juggle responsibilities concerning classes, personal matters and having to play on a weekly basis is no collegiate lifestyle that any individual can embrace.</p>\n<p>For freshman Emilia Petrachi, starting libero for the UCSB women’s volleyball team, this balance came before her status as a NCAA Division I athlete. Having trained and played volleyball for more than a decade, she comes from a country where the sport has thrived.</p>\n<p>“Growing up in Modena — it’s a small town, really quiet,” Petrachi said. “There’s not much going on there, but volleyball is a big thing in Italy.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>She attended and played high school volleyball for Liceo Classico San Carlo. While Petrachi played well at the high school level, she excelled at the club platform, playing for Liu Jo (LJ) Volley. Petrachi joined the club in 2013 and was placed on its Series A2 team.</p>\n<p>The decision to place her on the secondary team did not persist as her talent prompted her promotion to the Series A1 team in August 2013, making her the youngest member of the club for the remainder of the year and the following 2014-15 season. Petrachi’s addition to the club’s premier team was justified by her winning of the region’s Best Libero award in 2014.</p>\n<p>Her performance on the court exceeded the expectation that she would have a developmental role on the team, but being the club’s youngest member was overwhelming at times, as she wasn’t the only elite talent on the court anymore.</p>\n<p>“Being the youngest was hard because I needed to catch up with the experience of the others,” Petrachi said. “There were people that were 35 years old, 20 years old and myself as the youngest. But it for sure helped my growth as a volleyball player and person.”</p>\n<p>At the pinnacle of her volleyball career, Petrachi possessed veteran talent, but as a youth she was dealing with the responsibilities and pressures of playing school and club volleyball.</p>\n<p>While she was a vital asset to her high school’s volleyball team, Petrachi discovered a balancing component to her performance on the court that offered a unique twist to her identity as a competitor.</p>\n<p>This three-round translation competition is known as the Certamen Carolinum, testing students on their ability to translate Ancient Greek and Latin. It’s a form of competition that is reminiscent of a spelling bee, but with a foreign pizzazz that makes it just a tad bit more intriguing.</p>\n<p>Once introduced, it became the newest task that Petrachi was determined to conquer.</p>\n<p>Her fear of failure proved unfit for a competitor of her caliber. While learning a multitude of languages is common and tends to be innate within the European culture, Petrachi’s trouncing of the competition was unforeseen as she became a three-time winner.</p>\n<p>She won the translation competition twice in Latin and once in Ancient Greek, two languages that are convergent of her native language of Italian.</p>\n<p>“I like competition — I like to be the best in everything that I do,” Petrachi said. “It came naturally because I liked it and I wanted to be the best.”</p>\n<p>Although a well-known individual for her play on the court, it wasn’t Petrachi’s notoriety as a libero which earned her the opportunity to participate in the competition. In addition to being selected by a former high school teacher, her merits in the classroom and pure enjoyment for the competition led to her continued involvement.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t feel the pressure,” Petrachi said. “I competed really loosely, without the fear of losing.”</p>\n<p>Despite UCSB’s offering of courses in translation studies, no competition similar to the Certamen Carolinum exists. Although her schedule as a student-athlete wouldn’t permit time to create a rendition of the competition on campus, Petrachi remains confident with her translation abilities.</p>\n<p>“If there will ever be a competition, I will be ready to attend it,” she jokingly said.</p>\n<p>The story of a student-athlete succeeding off the court in an activity such as a translation competition may be striking for many, but it is Petrachi’s method in her decision to attend UCSB that is even more shocking, making her UCSB’s first international athlete in nearly 15 years.</p>\n<p>The college recruiting process is an exhausting experience for student-athletes — coaches calling at all times of the day with recruiting pitches, university visits, expectations of friends and family and the pressure of deciding where to dedicate the next four years of their life are all influences that help determine athletes’ future collegiate careers.</p>\n<p>For some prospects, their sights have always been focused on a dream college and are fulfilled with a scholarship offer. In today’s generation of sports, in which middle schoolers end up on high school teams and off seasons are submerged in training, young athletes in their pre-teens even receive offers from universities.</p>\n<p>However, the stresses of the recruiting process do not always follow suit. Guiding Petrachi’s decision to attend UCSB was a rare approach: intuition.</p>\n<p>Petrachi had never been to California. Visits to New York and Jacksonville, Florida served as her introductions to the American lifestyle. Still, this time could not make up for a lifetime in another country.</p>\n<p>Unlike most students, who are able to seek comfort from their families just hours away, Petrachi’s busy schedule also doesn’t permit the time for traveling the 5,000-plus mile distance that separates her and family in Italy.</p>\n<p>“It’s been tough because it’s a completely different world,” Petrachi said. “I didn’t know what to expect. I didn’t visit the campus or meet the coaches before coming here.”</p>\n<p>One Skype conversation with the team and personal research of the university were her only ideas of life in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Despite her unfamiliarity with the city, new team and coaching staff prior to the start of the season, Petrachi’s decision to attend UCSB didn’t solely revolve around her future in volleyball.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to come to a place where I would feel good even if I wasn’t playing volleyball,” she said. “I know volleyball can be upsetting at times. I needed a place in which I could shake off the homesickness. It’s [UCSB] right on the beach, I.V. is a little community, and it’s great and I’m happy.”</p>\n<p>Enjoying her new journey as a Gaucho, Petrachi’s first-year with the UCSB women’s volleyball team has been impressive despite the team’s struggles this season.</p>\n<p>Her overall average of 4.73 digs per set ranks second in the Big West Conference while she ranks third overall in the conference with 407 total digs. Petrachi is just one of three players in the Big West to break the 400 mark this season and recently earned her second Freshman Player of the Week award on Monday.</p>\n<p>She is 88 digs away from reaching former Gaucho Leah Sully’s single-season record of 495 digs, which ranks 10th all-time in program history.</p>\n<p>“It’s been an honor to become the libero for this team,” Petrachi said. “I try to give the best that I have. I want to be in the top five because I know that I can be in there. It’s an honor that I owe to the team.”</p>\n<p>Trusting her instincts to guide her future, Petrachi knows that UCSB is the right place for her and is appreciative of Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch for the opportunity to play on her team.</p>\n<p>“She went beyond the role of being a coach,” said Petrachi. “She helped me with integrating with the girls, making me meet people and ask questions. I’d probably be lost without her.”</p>\n<p>At 7-18 overall, 3-11 in conference play and with two matches remaining this season, UCSB is still young and will have to find a way to fill in the void of losing five seniors at the end of the year.</p>\n<p>But the future is promising for UCSB, especially with the tremendous talent and competitiveness that Petrachi has to offer.</p>\n<p>A gut feeling suggests that Petrachi will be the centerpiece in helping translate the Gauchos’ upside for the future.</p>\n<p>For more information on the Certamen Corlinum translation competition, visit its official website: www.certamencarolinum.de</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of November 19, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66598\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/the-competitive-edge-translated/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66598\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/the-competitive-edge-translated/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/the-competitive-edge-translated/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/the-competitive-edge-translated/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/the-competitive-edge-translated/","id":1993,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1992,1991,1990],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
