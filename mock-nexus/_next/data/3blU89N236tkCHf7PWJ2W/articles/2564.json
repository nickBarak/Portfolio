Rob Romero.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wearing an orange Santa Barbara County Jail shirt and blue pants, Chen stood behind glass in a separate room and communicated with his lawyer, Adam Pearlman, via a telephone on the wall. He did not speak except to acknowledge that he understood his right to a speedy trial would be postponed until his next trial date.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pearlman argued that photographers should not be allowed to take pictures of the proceedings Tuesday because of what he said was the “potential prejudice for potential jurors seeing Mr. Chen in a jail uniform,” but the judge ultimately allowed photographs by the press.</span></p>\n<p>When Ladinig was asked if he was considering a plea deal in exchange for the two other suspects, he said, “As of now, we’re just proceeding with Mr. Chen and Mr. Chen’s case.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A preliminary hearing is set for March 2 in front of Judge Pauline Maxwell, and Pearlman indicated he would likely request bail for his client at that time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Separately, the victim filed a personal injury lawsuit against the UC Regents <a

“understaffed and insufficiently trained” to investigate the case and that UCSB improperly reports its sexual assault statistics.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

and messages popped up, I wasn’t very concerned about who was saying these things because, at the end of the day, it’s just a handful of folks who were trying to be edgy or incendiary,” Hakim said. “I think giving it too much attention is giving them exactly what they want.”</p>\n<p>Chalking sidewalks is a violation of the UCSB posting <a href=\"https://www.sa.ucsb.edu/osl/GreekLife/Policies/PostingAreas.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">policy</a> and can result in a maximum fine of $20 for a first offense.</p>\n<p>The university declined to comment on the markings, but university spokesperson Andrea Estrada said in an email that “because of the numerous posting violations that have occurred recently,” the Office of Student Life (OSL) will be sending an email to all students reminding them of the posting policy and letting them know where to report violations.</p>\n<p>Hakim said he was most worried about the marginalization of Muslim students on campus.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69235\" style=\"width: 305px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69235\" data-attachment-id=\"69235\"

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Photo courtesy of YouTube channel The Public</em></p></div>\n<p>Goodman has hosted “Democracy Now!” since 1996, and for most of that time it has run on KCSB-FM, the UCSB radio station that is presenting Goodman’s talk and book signing. Goodman’s book, <em>Democracy Now!: Twenty Years Covering the Movements Changing America</em>, written with contributors David Goodman and Denis Moynihan, will be released on April 12.</p>\n<p>“One of our first stops is Santa Barbara and a fundraiser for KCSB,” Goodman said in a phone interview Tuesday. “I’ll be talking about independent media in a time of war and elections and how important it is to have the media, when we cover war, that’s not brought to you by these weapons manufacturers.”</p>\n<p>Goodman said her new book explores “the idea that it’s movements that make history,” rather than individual politicians.</p>\n<p>“Instead of hearing the same small circle of pundits, who know so little about so much, explaining the world to us and getting it so wrong, you hear people [on “Democracy Now!”] at the grassroots, closest to the story, telling their own stories,” Goodman said.</p>\n<p>When the show began, “Democracy Now!” was broadcast on nine community radio stations. Twenty years later, the program is broadcast on more than 1,400 television and radio stations internationally.</p>\n<p>Goodman said she wanted to make college campuses a major part of her 100-city tour because universities and student activism are central to her show’s purpose.</p>\n<p>“We have a young, diverse audience and there’s so much happening on college campuses around the country, so it’s a critical part of what we do,” Goodman said, mentioning the Black Lives Matter movements last year at the University of Missouri, Ithaca College and more. “It is astounding how students’ voices are a key part of these movements.”</p>\n<p>When asked about the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/controversial-trump-markings-surface-around-campus/\" target=\"_blank\">recent chalk markings around UCSB</a> supporting Donald Trump and disparaging immigrants and Muslims, Goodman called the slogans “extremely insulting.”</p>\n<p>“What Donald Trump has done is really open Pandora’s box with his hate-filled rhetoric; his islamophobic, sexist, racist language; his outright encouraging violence at his rallies,” Goodman said, adding that the students’ reaction was vital to maintaining a welcoming environment.</p>\n<p>“I think students’ reaction—banding together and saying they won’t tolerate hate on campus—is a very important one and it’s a part of a whole coalescing of student activism,” Goodman said. “I think there’s a lot of energy on campus and a lot of commitment to making change, and that’s critical to the functioning of the democratic society.”</p>\n<p>The Daily Nexus is named after a quotation attributed to educator Robert Maynard Hutchins: “A free press is the nexus of any democracy.”</p>\n<p>Goodman said Hutchins’ words are “absolutely” as true today as they were in 1970 when the <em>Nexus</em> was renamed.</p>\n<p>“I think independent media is the oxygen of a democracy, whether on campuses or off campuses,” Goodman said. “There is a reason why our profession — journalism — is the only one explicitly protected by the U.S. Constitution, because we’re supposed to be the check and balance.”</p>\n<p>Goodman will be speaking at Corwin Pavilion at 7:30 p.m. on Sunday. The event is free for students and $10 for non-students. Tickets can be purchased online at events.ucsb.edu or at the Associated Students Ticket Office.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, April 7 edition of the <em>Daily

food program Isla Carte is holding monthly tasting events for their proposed food cart program expected to launch in fall of 2017.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2>The student-run program is currently holding monthly tasting events to establish the menu of a proposed sustainable food cart.</h2>\n<p>Student-run food program Isla Carte is holding monthly tasting events for their proposed food cart program, with the goal of launching by Fall 2017.</p>\n<p>Isla Carte’s food cart program aims to launch another food cart on campus, similar to the Wahoo’s and Die Bretzel food carts located in the Arbor, to provide students with organic, local and sustainable food options on campus. The food cart will be primarily run by university student employees Monday through Friday and be under the same regulation as other restaurants on campus. The organization will be picking the menu based on the most popular food items sold at their monthly food tasting events.</p>\n<p>Laney Ennis, fourth-year environmental studies major, said the organization’s goal is to have generous portions with affordable prices for students.</p>\n<p>“We want it to be food that can fill somebody up,” Ennis said. “Our number one priority is that it’s local, and we make sure that everything we use is organic.”</p>\n<p>Ennis said she took over Isla Carte after the organization’s leaders graduated last year, to provide students with healthy and local food options.</p>\n<p>“A lot of our farming system is really messed up and really dominated by these huge corporations,” Ennis said. “I really wanted to do something that brings back local farms and more sustainable agriculture and gives students an on-campus option for that.”</p>\n<p>Ennis said one of the organization’s goals is to lower prices for sustainable food through seasonal shopping to avoid paying extra for imported foods, cutting back on meat and buying “ugly” fruits and vegetables.</p>\n<p>“It really doesn’t have to be more expensive and we’re basically going to be doing the work for you,” Ennis said. “We’re going to be looking at what the cheapest sustainable foods are, because we really want to bring prices down to something that all students can afford.”</p>\n<p>Ennis said while most of their food is sourced from I.V. Co-op, Isla Carte is trying to build relationships with local farmers.</p>\n<p>“When we think about what we want to serve, there are so many aspects to look at. You can look at water use, how far it had to be transported, what chemical fertilizers they’re using,” Ennis said. “That’s where a lot of the thinking and menu-planning has to come in. We can do that so you don’t have to.”</p>\n<p>Austen Trout, second-year physics major, said he respects the group’s mission but personally does not care about the origins of his food ingredients.</p>\n<p>“It seems like they have good intentions, and they’re trying to do something that is unique,” Trout said. “As long as my food doesn’t kill me, I’m fine with it. I’m not that picky about where it comes from or who made it.”</p>\n<p>Michael Lin, second-year theater major, said the most accessible eating choice for sustainable food is the dining commons.</p>\n<p>“The dining commons have taken strides to becoming healthier and more sustainable, but going another full step forward would be great … if it’s maybe cheaper than the dining meal plans,” Lin said.</p>\n<p>Alexa Rogalski, second-year biology major, said she thinks the food cart is a “great idea” and will broaden the selection of food available on campus.</p>\n<p>“It’s a good option for people who don’t like the food on campus. I don’t feel like the food on campus is really healthy, so having a healthy option would be awesome,” Rogalski said. “If it’s sustainable that’s an even bigger plus.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Jan 28, 2016 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67746\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/isla-carte-provides-free-monthly-food-tastings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67746\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/isla-carte-provides-free-monthly-food-tastings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/isla-carte-provides-free-monthly-food-tastings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/isla-carte-provides-free-monthly-food-tastings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/isla-carte-provides-free-monthly-food-tastings/","id":2563,"author":{"id":112,"name":"Natalie Overton"},"related":[2562,2561,2560],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
