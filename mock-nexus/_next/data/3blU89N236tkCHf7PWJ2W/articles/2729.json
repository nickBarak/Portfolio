After providing temporary summer storage for approximately 200 UCLA students last year, Yoder decided to expand his business to UCSB and rename it BoxCamp. The company provides students with boxes to pack their belongings in, which students then drop off at designated locations on campus. Boxes are stored for the entire summer and will be available for pick-up or can be delivered for a fee at the start of the upcoming school year. BoxCamp offers students either a storage box with dimensions 18x18x16 inches for $35 or two boxes of the same size for $65. Students can also store suitcases, microwaves, mattresses, mini fridges and dressers separately for an additional cost, with insurance provided for all stored items.</p>\n<p>Yoder said students will be able to purchase summer storage and flat-rate delivery beginning the last two weeks of school outside residence halls. BoxCamp will allow students to focus on their studies and not have to stress about moving and storage, according to Yoder.</p>\n<p>“During the tenth week and finals week, we will be tabling for new orders, distributing boxes to students living in the residence halls and picking up their boxes to be stored at an off-campus location,” Yoder said. “This will help many students living in the dorms with the move-out process and allow them to focus on their final exams.”</p>\n<p>Yoder said he began working with the Residence Hall Association (RHA) to bring BoxCamp to UCSB after he learned students have few storage options available to them during the summer, because storage units in Santa Barbara are expensive and tend to fill up quickly.</p>\n<p>“We really hope that we can provide a good service to UC Santa Barbara students that they did not really have offered to them before,” Yoder said. “The goal is to help people save some money and not have to take all their stuff home for the summer.”</p>\n<p>BoxCamp representative and third-year economics and accounting major Harrison Goldblatt said he is working on last minute details with RHA, but expects the service to be ready for students during the last two weeks of school.</p>\n<p>“We are not sure exactly where we will be tabling as of now, but students will definitely see us outside the residence halls and on campus during the last two weeks of school,” Goldblatt said. “There, we will be ready to take student orders for their summer storage needs.”</p>\n<p>First-year actuarial science major Kaila Martinez said BoxCamp could be the solution to her storage problem because she is unable to move her belongings into summer housing in Isla Vista immediately at the end of the school year, and it would be inconvenient for her to store them at home.</p>\n<p>“I cannot move my stuff into my new place in I.V. right after finals and I do not want to move it from the dorms down to Oceanside and then back again,” Martinez said. “BoxCamp seems super convenient and might be the right way to avoid moving my things back and forth.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Seikaly described what ISIL is, what they stand for, how the group came to be and the violence they have committed. Sabra discussed sectarianism, the Arab Spring and compared ISIL to the terrorist group Al-Qaeda.</p>\n<p>According to Seikaly, the terrorist group was influenced by Saddam Hussein’s authoritarian regime and developed after the United States’ invasion of Iraq. Seikaly said ISIL was not a direct result of Islamic or religious “essentialism.”</p>\n<p>“What I think is important about looking at the history of Arab authoritarianism in Iraq and in Syria and the role of U.S. intervention is understanding that ISIS is a product of historical context,” Seikaly said.</p>\n<p>Sabra said the reason for ISIL’s success in recruiting diverse followers, such as doctors and other professionals from around the world, is that the group claims to be the Islamic government left after Muhammed’s death, or the caliphate.</p>\n<p>“A significant number of people have come, for example, from Europe,” Sabra said. “There have been others who’ve come from other parts of the Arab world — Tunisia has a particularly large contingent. We don’t really know how many more people may be attracted to this movement in the long run.”</p>\n<p>According to Sabra, ISIL recruits people by posting videos about celebration and triumph in addition to their violent footage of executions.</p>\n<p>“ISIS has done a very good job of recruiting people with their slick videos — not all their videos are about violence,” Sabra said. “After they took Mosul, they had all these videos about celebration and their great victory.”</p>\n<p>Seikaly said although ISIL pledged allegiance to Al-Qaeda, the group is more than an offshoot of the militant organization: It actively looks to govern and adjudicate a community and aspires to build a state.</p>\n<p>According to Sabra, people draw false conclusions and fail to understand how ISIL developed, which leads to difficulty when attempting to solve the political problems in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>“If you know the history, it’s much easier to understand how this has happened, and to also assess the future possibilities for continuing expansion or perhaps ending this movement eventually,” Sabra said.</p>\n<p>UCSB History Club president and fourth-year history of public policy major Darren Chen said people should strive to understand the historical background of the terrorist group and understand ISIL from a different perspective.</p>\n<p>“Obviously we understand that there’s ISIS from a political science perspective, there’s ISIS from a global studies perspective, but people never really had a historical perspective. When you have a historian, it gives you a much different view,” Chen said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Thursday, May 21, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63681\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/ucsb-professors-discuss-historical-view-on-isil/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63681\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/ucsb-professors-discuss-historical-view-on-isil/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/ucsb-professors-discuss-historical-view-on-isil/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/ucsb-professors-discuss-historical-view-on-isil/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/ucsb-professors-discuss-historical-view-on-isil/","id":2726,"author":{"id":154,"name":"Christopher Chen"},"related":[2725,2724,2723],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Last A.S.

Legal Code, which states campus organizations’ leftover funds not approved for rollover to the next fiscal year will move to the A.S. Finance and Business Committee for allocation to related causes. Senate also considered fourteen campus organizations’ requests to roll remaining funding into next year’s accounts, approving ten and denying four.</p>\n<p>College of Creative Studies (CCS) Collegiate Senator and second-year CCS physics major Liam Stanton said he opposed the bill because he feels A.S. should use funding not approved for rollover to secure its own budget, rather than be forced to use it on related causes through the A.S. Finance and Business Committee.</p>\n<p>“If we did [not pass the bill] we’d have tens of thousands of dollars, sometimes hundreds of thousands, extra and we wouldn’t have to tread water partially every year like we do,” Stanton said. “Anyone in part of A.S. that needed more money could request it and we’d be much more flexible.”</p>\n<p>College of Engineering Collegiate Senator and fourth-year mechanical engineering major Jonathan Rothschild said he was concerned the bill does not say what would happen if funds move to the A.S. Finance and Business Committee and remain unused.</p>\n<p>“I think there are some holes, specifically when these go into a specific fund for Finance Board; there is nothing saying what happens to them after the year ends,” Rothschild said.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator and second-year history of public policy major Cassie Mancini said the bill could prevent a “conflict of interest,” because A.S. will not have the option to use money denied for rollover.</p>\n<p>“It would be in our self-interest to deny rollovers, but with this we’re actually making sure that they’re put into Finance and Business,” Mancini said.</p>\n<p>College of Letters and Sciences Collegiate Senator and third-year history of public policy major Jimmy Villarreal said there could be conflict over how A.S. Finance and Business Committee allocates funds that were denied for rollover.</p>\n<p>“I could see some groups that lost their rollover come and disagree with how the Finance and Business Committee used that money, whether or not that money was used for whatever students voted that money to go towards,” Villarreal said.</p>\n<p>A.S. President and fourth-year sociology and psychology double major Ali Guthy said Senate should not easily approve campus organizations’ requests to roll over funding.</p>\n<p>“Students paid these fees for this year,” Guthy said. “We should not be setting the precedent of continuously rolling over funds, because students pay for funding this year and they need to go to students this year in services.”</p>\n<p>After much debate, senate tabled the bill indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Senate granted rollover requests to A.S. Media Center, A.S. Bike Committee, A.S. Department of Public Worms, A.S. Commission on Disability Equality, A.S. Food Bank Committee, Environmental Affairs Board, Zero Waste Committee, Take Back the Night, A.S. Office of the Controller and A.S. Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee.</p>\n<p>Campus organizations that were denied rollover requests were A.S. Elections Committee, The Bottom Line, A.S.

Blunite’s LED lights will be available in Storke Plaza as an alternative to candles.</p>\n<p>ASPB commissioner and fourth-year global studies major Benjamin Simons said ASPB purchased 4,000 LED lights from Blunite to distribute free of charge to students at the vigil.</p>\n<p>“They will be passed out in Storke Plaza,” Simons said in an email. “If students and community members want to purchase them beforehand, then the easiest way to purchase is from the Blunite website, bluniteiv.org.”</p>\n<p>Fifteen staff from Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) will provide support to students at the event, according to Simons.</p>\n<p>“They will be wearing blue vests this time, and if they are not wearing vests, they will do something else to designate themselves,” Simons said in an email. “There will also be a small announcement made at the event to identify them to the crowd.”</p>\n<p>Simons said local and campus entities have helped ASPB coordinate the event.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63672\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63672\" data-attachment-id=\"63672\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/isla-vista-remembers-may-23rd/vigil-anniversary_nexus-file-photo-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil-Anniversary_Nexus-File-Photo-2.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1400962864\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Vigil Anniversary_Nexus File Photo-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil-Anniversary_Nexus-File-Photo-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil-Anniversary_Nexus-File-Photo-2.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-63672 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil-Anniversary_Nexus-File-Photo-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"Daily Nexus file photo\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil-Anniversary_Nexus-File-Photo-2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil-Anniversary_Nexus-File-Photo-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63672\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Like last year’s, this Saturday’s anniversarial candlelight vigil and memorial walk, will end with an open mic and an invitation to community members to share their memories and offer support to one another. <em>Daily Nexus File Photo.</em></p></div>\n<p>“We have had a lot of the assistance from IVRPD, LOTP, ASOP, and many other individual and strong-willed students,” Simons said in an email.</p>\n<p>Second-year communication and global studies double major Javier Zamora said he plans to attend the event because the UCSB community is “like family” to him.</p>\n<p>“It’s incredibly important for me to contribute to the tremendous amount of strength and love we have as a community to remember our beloved Gauchos we lost a year ago,” Zamora said.</p>\n<p>Third-year communication major Lindsey Jesberg said she will attend the event to join others in remembering the students who passed away in the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“I want to be with my fellow Gauchos to both remember the six beautiful souls we lost and to celebrate the community we are all fortunate enough to call home,” Jesberg said.</p>\n<p>Third-year biology major Nicolette Lambright said the event will prompt her to think about how the community has responded to the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“It will give me the opportunity to reflect on the events that unfolded last May and be reminded of the strength, love, and positivity that fills UCSB and Isla Vista,” Lambright said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of Thursday, May 21, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
