id=\"caption-attachment-84938\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Wikicommons</p></div>\n<p>According to CalFresh Advocate Stephanie Perez, the Arbor is the first store on the UCSB campus at which students can use CalFresh.</p>\n<p>CalFresh, also known as the Federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (S.N.A.P.), gives eligible individuals electronically distributed monetary benefits every month which can be spent at specified local markets or grocery stores, according to the official website of the California Department of Social Services.</p>\n<p>The website also states that participants of the program are administered Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Cards which they can use to purchase food items at stores that accept CalFresh.</p>\n<p>“At UCSB, we estimate that about 10,000 students are eligible for CalFresh, and if you’re eligible, you may get up to $192 a month,” Melissa Fontaine, the food security coordinator at UCSB, said.</p>\n<p>During the 2016-17 academic school year, the UCSB CalFresh Team enrolled roughly 600 students in CalFresh, and 3,000 students in the following year, according to Fontaine.</p>\n<p>This year the CalFresh team hopes to enroll 6,000 students in the program by the end of Spring Quarter, Fontaine said.</p>\n<p>Fontaine said the new availability of CalFresh at the Arbor happened largely because the UCSB Sustainability Program saw student need for more affordable food options.</p>\n<p>UCSB CalFresh Advocate Stephanie Perez, a fourth-year psychology major, echoed this sentiment both as a representative of CalFresh and a participant in the program.</p>\n<p>“I actually grew up with food stamps, so I’m very familiar with the CalFresh program,” Perez said. “Without food stamps, I don’t think my family would’ve gotten through, especially since I come from a low-income household.”</p>\n<p>Now, as a UCSB student, Perez notes that CalFresh provides a new mobility and convenience to students that may not have been able to afford grabbing a quick snack in between classes at the Arbor.</p>\n<p>“Especially during midterms or maybe finals or maybe throughout the day, students sometimes don’t have time to go grocery shopping or don’t have time to go get a snack at home,” she said.</p>\n<p>Christian Ortiz Gonzalez, a fifth-year sociology and german studies major, was also heavily involved in bringing CalFresh to the school.</p>\n<p>“I decided to work on getting EBT accepted at UCSB because I saw a dire need for it,” Ortiz Gonzalez said in an email to the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Ortiz Gonzalez said he worked with several UCSB administrators and staff to help implement the program on campus.</p>\n<p>The new availability of CalFresh at the Arbor also follows a recent shift in the on-campus stigma surrounding the CalFresh program, which resulted from effective tabling and campaigning on the part of the CalFresh team, Perez said.</p>\n<p>“I think now, to be honest, UCSB has normalized what CalFresh is…I’ve heard a lot of people say, ‘Hey, how have do you not have CalFresh,’ like ‘You need to get on CalFresh.’”</p>\n<p>Fontaine stated she wanted to wait until the Arbor staff was fully trained on how to properly process CalFresh payments before making a public announcement about CalFresh’s availability.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important for the Arbor that their systems and staff are ready to go before students come to start spending their EBT CalFresh cards here at the Arbor because we want to make sure that everyone has a really great experience.”</p>\n<p>Now that CalFresh is available at the Arbor, Perez hopes the program will spread to other markets and food stores on campus.</p>\n<p>Fontaine said the spread of the program will “benefit both students and stores.”</p>\n<p>“Let’s say our school year last year ended with about 3,000 students who were eligible [for CalFresh] and they were getting $120 a month [through the CalFresh program],” she said. “That becomes $360,000 that could be spent, and is likely to be spent, in the local community. And over the course of the year, that’s over four million dollars.”</p>\n<p>“That would benefit business like the Arbor, Tenaya Market, the Isla Vista Food Co-op… Their sales will increase because students now have more purchasing power, so that’s tremendous.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Nov. 15, 2018, print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated [Jan. 2, 2019]: This article was updated to include information about Gonzalez. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84937\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsbs-arbor-now-accepting-calfresh/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84937\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsbs-arbor-now-accepting-calfresh/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsbs-arbor-now-accepting-calfresh/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsbs-arbor-now-accepting-calfresh/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsbs-arbor-now-accepting-calfresh/","id":2193,"author":{"id":33,"name":"Isabell Liu"},"related":[2192,2191,2190],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":33,"name":"Isabell Liu","biography":"Not available","articles":[2144,2184,2193,2210,2933,3031,3223,3720,3732],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

She confirmed she is living off campus rather than on campus.</p>\n<p>As an on-campus senator, Salari is required to “live amongst [her] constituents during Fall, Winter and Spring Quarters of their year of elective service,” according to Article II Section 1(B)(4) of the Associated Students (A.S.) legal code.</p>\n<p>Salari said she intended to live on campus when she ran for the position, but cited financial burdens as the reason she was unable to.</p>\n<p>“I am an on-campus senator, and I know a lot of people are, I guess, upset about the fact that I’m living off campus,” Salari said during the meeting.</p>\n<p>“When I got elected for it, and because of some financial issues, I wasn’t able to [live on campus]. As many of you know, living on campus is more expensive.”</p>\n<p>She said she would be “more than happy” to privately discuss further details about her financial issues.</p>\n<p>Salari ran on a platform of reinforcing UCSB’s student health care system, citing early closing hours and the lack of an urgent care system.</p>\n<p>The A.S. Attorney General Zeina Safadi sent out an email to all senators to discuss Salari’s standing.</p>\n<p>Safadi said A.S. Elections Board initially approached Salari to ask about her living situation after they had received a complaint, to which she “did not provide a conclusive answer.”</p>\n<p>“There was no prior indication to Senate as a whole that Yasamin was in financial burden and thus Yasamin was not transparent about this situation; with that, there was an active effort to conceal,” Safadi said in the email.</p>\n<p>“Furthermore, the initial refusal to answer questions about her living situation solidifies the lack of transparency, and thus indicates her acknowledgement of violating the rule and the subsequent concealment of the violation.”</p>\n<p>Safadi added that “concealing the truth about not living among your representative constituents is a direct violation of [A.S.] Legal Code.”</p>\n<p>During Wednesday night’s Senate meeting, Senate voted to give Salari a one-time exception with the stipulation that her living situation would be later discussed within the A.S. Internal Committee.</p>\n<p>Several senators also discussed permanently changing legal codes to allow for future exceptions. There was no motion made regarding legal code changes.</p>\n<p><em>Correction [Nov. 16]: Salari did not specify the exact location of where she is living, only stating she is living off campus. That information was obtained from the email from A.G. and has been removed from this article at Salari’s request. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The event was organized by Senator Solomon (left). <em>Courtesy of Zion Solomon</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB students, led by UCSB Associated Students Senator Zion Solomon, organized the “Trans Joy Take Over” to increase visibility within the trans community.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to bring a positive movement and show trans people that they are seen and visible and show people why it’s important to show solidarity with trans folks even if they aren’t trans themselves,” said Solomon, a second-year history of public policy major.</p>\n<p>The effort consisted of card- and poster-making activities on Monday and Tuesday in the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) room, located within the Student Resource Building (SRB).</p>\n<p>Students also tabled in the Arbor on Thursday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.</p>\n<p>These events were supported with funds from the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) and RCSGD, Solomon said.</p>\n<p>“I know that suicide rates for trans people are rising and it’s not good for the mental health of trans people to be seeing this in the media, so regardless of whether they’re home or here, people are affected by it,” they said.</p>\n<p>Several other volunteers joined Solomon in the Arbor.</p>\n<p>Elisabeth Andres, a second-year sociology major, expressed that this event could be very informative and valuable to people without much knowledge of the transgender community.</p>\n<p>“I think having visibility, having trans flags and rainbow flags out here and all of our signs really can leave an impact on someone who might not know a lot about the trans or LGBTQ+ community,” Andres said.</p>\n<p>Diego Reyes, a second-year biology major who tabled on Thursday, is adamant about the drastic implications the Trump Administration’s policy might have.</p>\n<p>“I know there are a lot of people who have their own opinions on what being transgender means and about what being non-binary means,” Reyes said. “I feel like that passing gives them a pass to spread trans antagonism and trans hatred… And I think if that passes then it’s gonna come back probably a hundred times worse [than it already is].”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“It’s a very difficult existence when your whole identity is being questioned… scrutinized repeatedly throughout the course of your day, throughout the course of your life.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>UCSB’s administration has “been pretty responsive to trans needs” but always has room to improve, Solomon said.</p>\n<p>Their primary concern is how the environment created by students on campus for transgender people could potentially see a big change following the gender redefinition policy.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that this will affect this university’s response. Maybe the students’ response and maybe transphobic people at this university, but I think we should still be pushing the university to support trans students regardless of whatever the administration says,” Solomon said.</p>\n<p>Riley Hsieh, a second-year political science major, talked about the importance of support from allies who extend beyond just the queer and trans community.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important that we have allies in the community… because it’s a very difficult existence when your whole identity is being questioned… scrutinized repeatedly throughout the course of your day, throughout the course of your life.”</p>\n<p>Ivana Cruz spoke about how mistakes in pronoun use, whether deliberate or not, can feel invalidating and isolating, “especially in academic circles.”</p>\n<p>“Even if there’s a slip with a pronoun and they don’t take time to acknowledge that, it can really intimidate you from an already-intimidating process of reaching out to your professors.”</p>\n<p>However, Cruz stressed that solidarity can lead to progress and inclusivity and positive change.</p>\n<p>“I try to look at what’s possible. I look at the fact that 20 years ago we wouldn’t be having an event like this. We wouldn’t be having open conversations about pronouns without being laughed at. They, them would still be grammatically incorrect,” Cruz said.</p>\n<p>“I just think that we as a community have a responsibility to grow more and that’s essentially what’s going to lead to a very progressing change.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
