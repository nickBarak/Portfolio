Senate was led by IVP Steven Ho. Although Ho did make an effort to keep his Senate under tabs, multiple instances of disorder showcased in Senate meetings were ultimately left unmediated by Ho, who is responsible for being both diplomatic and bipartisan in the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> believes Alli Adam will better equipped to handle unruly situations and facilitate Senate meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, Adam served as a Letters and Sciences senator where she learned that the common goal of A.S. – to help the student body as a whole – often gets lost in “pettiness on the Senate floor.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to run for internal vice president to access the full potential and legitimacy that the Senate could have,” Adam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam plans to crack down on the use of technology during public forum, which is an area that she believes Ho did not spend enough effort to enforce. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam finds the current penalty for technology use, docking honoraria, to be ineffective, noting that most senators breach the policy and use technology anyways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To remediate this problem, Adam plans to have senators “put their phone next to their name tags,” where they will be much more visible to the public, other senators and the IVP. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam proposed this idea because she finds that senators “aren’t as attentive” as they should be, despite the importance of public forum, when “members of our community and our campus come to talk to who they believe is to be representing them and responsive to their needs and responsive to their concerns.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To further uphold a healthy environment at Senate meetings, Adam said she will have “no problem kicking people out of public forum if they are inappropriate… I can’t have my senators feeling like they’re unsafe when somebody’s coming in for public forums.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When questioned about her qualifications for the position, Adam cited her experience in mock trial, public speaking, her work in the office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs, an internship at the Alumni Association  and her work in Senate this past year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Adam’s public forum resolution didn’t “pan out” the way she wanted it to, she stands behind it because it provides students a concrete and guaranteed time to speak at public forum. The resolution was created in order to hold public forum at a set time, before the “new business” section of the Senate agenda. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of her resolution, Adam also provided students with a “campus-wide school supply drive,” where she was “able to save the time and money of over 500 students during Week One.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of personal qualities, Adam said she will take advantage of her assertiveness and confidence to help keep order and set precedent at Senate meetings.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m confident and unafraid to have order in the Senate room because I think the lack of order and the lack of control has let us senators think we can do whatever we want,” Adam said. “We all need to be on the same page and we all need to have a consistent behavior so that we’re cohesive and we’re productive.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, when asked about an instance where she was able to display her assertiveness, Adam was not able to list any tangible examples, citing the “toxic” and “disheartening” atmosphere at Senate meetings where she felt “honest opinions aren’t valued.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a larger scale, the role of IVP requires whoever is filling the seat to remain neutral, unbiased and bipartisan. Adam has run with Campus United, one of the two A.S parties, for both her Senate and executive campaigns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When questioned about her bipartisanship, Adam pledged that, even in the event all other executives are members of the Isla Vista Party, “I am 100% committed to being a neutral and unbiased IVP.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam believes that “drive” and “determination” are much stronger metrics of qualification than party affiliation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam believes working with other executives is “about setting clear goals and clear standards so that we can refer back to them when things do get tricky.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked to critique the current IVP, Adam cited multiple grievances with Ho throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam is chiefly concerned with the timeliness of training, which educates incoming senators on the various parts of A.S. According to Adam, no formal training occurred until Winter Quarter, two quarters after elections concluded. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I kind of felt like our first half of Senate was whether or not you had an in with Steven and you could be his friend enough to get the information,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honoraria, another aspect that Adam holds frustration with, failed to be distributed in a timely manner this year. Honoraria is sometimes used for “basic needs,” according to Adam, when students rely on its timeliness to make payments. To combat this, Adam pledges to ensure that honoraria will be paid on time at the end of each quarter, as well as to post honoraria links so necessary BCUs (Boards, Committees and Units) can receive their funding as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam’s final grievance with Ho’s tenure rests in his oversight of the Senate as a whole. Adam said Ho let senators “run amok” during Senate meetings, which hindered the Senate’s ability to have productive meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho’s poor control of Senate resulted in “a lack of change being made for students,” Adam said, as well as “a lack of legislation because certain senators feel like if they introduce something, it’s going to be like verbally scoffed at.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, Adam is working with another senator, Melissa Perez, to create an alternative method for members of A.S. to interact with students, as she finds that the default settings of Senate meetings are often “toxic” and “intense,” which can deter students from sharing their ideas. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Whether it’s on FaceTime, whether it’s an anonymous email or an anonymous comment, we’re going to have a list that we want to get back out to the students so that they know how they can still contact us if they don’t feel comfortable in the room,” Adam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is also room for improvement in how senators manage BCUs. Adam feels that senators need to do a better job listening to BCUs needs, as it is a senator’s job to be a liaison between their respective BCU and the Senate itself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, Adam suggested that she will ask future senators to “personalize” relationships with their respective BCU, so they can better tune in to each BCU’s specific need.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For me, it comes down to personalizing and, as a senator, how you’re going to work with your BCU,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To maintain transparency within the Senate, Adam proposed the idea of holding one-on-one meetings with each senator every quarter. By doing so, the meetings will allow her to maintain “a clear line of communication” among the entire Senate and help answer any questions senators have by pointing them in the right direction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At every Senate meeting, there is an allocated spot on the agenda for specific on-campus organizations to deliver an update. However, there is almost never a physical presence. Adam plans to “hunt down” these representatives because hearing from them “really helps senators know what those spaces are up to,” as well as “build trust in senators so they can go and collaborate with those people on certain issues.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next year, if elected, Adam would like to have more oversight of Finance and Business, the IVP’s administrative committee and have a Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.)  counselor present at every Senate meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam also expressed her frustration in the lack of resources for students to store their belongings at the end of Spring Quarter. Currently, students can take their belongings home, pay a fee to keep it in a storage locker or move into their new residence two weeks after finals end. Adam would like to create an interim storage solution to allow students to store their belongings as they shift between leases. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Adam would also like to incorporate more funding to “prioritize mental health” without raising student fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Adam has not demonstrated as much tangible change in Senate as the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">would like to see. But we do believe that, coupled with her ideas to improve the role of IVP, her work outside of Senate and her drive to make A.S. a better entity, Adam is an effective, bipartisan and diplomatic candidate for the role of internal vice president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, we believe she has the maturity and confidence to facilitate Wednesday night A.S. Senate meetings effectively. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Daily Nexus Editorial Board is comprised of the editor in chief and the news team. </span></i></p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-87556\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that is not to say that Griffin’s endorsement is a complete stamp of approval: both candidates had significant advantages and weaknesses that the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> took into consideration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Griffin received the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus’</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> endorsement because of the work he has done, the familiarity he has with local government bodies and officials as well as his platform, which had more concrete ideas that could go a long way for the community if implemented. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin runs for this position after having worked in the Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) office since his freshman year, when he applied for the fellowship program within the office. That year, Griffin worked with then EVPLA Ashcon Minoiefar to find homes for students who were displaced due to a balcony collapse in a home on Del Playa Drive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That same year, Griffin also served as the treasurer for Hall Council in Santa Cruz Hall. Griffin noted in his interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Santa Cruz Hall was the only residence hall that year to not ask for additional funds from Residential Housing Association at the end of the year. He cited this as evidence of his fiscal responsibility, which he said he would apply to the EVPLA position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that it’s important that people who are in those positions are responsible with student fees. And that’s an example of me being responsible as student fees,” Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following year, Griffin served as the I.V. liaison for the office and began working with different groups in I.V. and familiarizing himself with the arena of local politics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, Griffin studied abroad in Fall Quarter. When he came back to UCSB, he did not serve in an Associated Students role on campus, but was involved with the Beloved Community Conference Committee and served as president of the UC Santa Barbara chapter of The One Campaign, an international organization taking action against poverty and preventable disease. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, for his senior year, Griffin believes it is the right time for him to step into the position.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I thought that I would come back [from studying abroad] and do what I’ve always wanted to do and be the EVPLA,” Griffin said. “Or at least give myself the chance to run and share my story with students and share why I think I would be the best candidate to represent students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for his platform, Griffin has already made efforts to ensure the feasibility and completion of some of his projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin discussed the possibility of a community court in I.V. with local representatives Joan Hartmann and District Attorney Joyce Dudley, who he said were in favor of implementing the plan in the next year. The court would allow I.V. residents to attend hearings for minor infractions, such as underage drinking and parking violations, at a location in I.V. rather than at the courthouse in downtown Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given the circumstances of many students in I.V., such as busy schedules and a lack of transportation, the option to attend hearings locally would lift a weight off students’ shoulders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most [students] don’t have cars and yes, there is a bus that goes down there, but most of these court dates are Friday at 8:00 a.m. and sometimes the buses are too full or sometimes [students] can’t get to the bus on time,” Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin is also aiming for a project that has long been an unfulfilled aspect of previous EVPLA platforms: free wifi in parks and beaches in I.V. Although the project has failed to gain footing in the past, Griffin believes completing the project is just a matter of “laying the groundwork.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s a project that can’t be completed in nine months. It can be started in nine months, but then there’s lack of continuity in that transition. So I think that now, given the fact that we have structured government in Isla Vista… pushing for it and continuing to lay the groundwork for [the parks] can have it go throughout the next few years,” Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To address food insecurity, Griffin wants to create a food bank in I.V. by collaborating with local grocery stores to give away the food those stores don’t sell. Griffin said after meeting with someone from the I.V. Food Co-op, he believes stores would be willing to donate food that is close to expiring so that students can access it for free at a designated location in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite his thorough platform ideas, which the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> believes will benefit students if they are seen through, Griffin still seems to be slightly out of touch with student issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, Griffin must ensure that groups which he cannot speak for are able and encouraged to speak and express their own concerns, grievances and hopes for the community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I cannot speak on behalf of all communities and identities in Isla Vista and UCSB’s campus, but I really like marketing Associated Students and I think that if the EVPLA Office and A.S. as a whole can work to market our services and market what we do as an entity, I think that that gives a little bit more outreach to those communities,” Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is possible for Griffin to amplify these voices in his office, but it will be up to him to provide that opportunity.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin also failed to adequately address sexual assault, violence and harassment in his platform and interview. As something that has consistent advocacy from student organizations, UCSB’s Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education Center and I.V.’s local governments, sexual violence in I.V. and at UCSB is an issue that needs to be on the EVPLA’s radar. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When discussing police presence in I.V., another contested issue in the community, Griffin again seemed to lack the perspective that some students hold about feeling unsafe with police. Griffin said he wants to “bridge the gap” between students and police, namely by holding public forums to foster discussions between the two and “really working to give more of a backstory of the police officers.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> had concerns that Griffin somewhat overlooked the serious worries of students who do not feel safe around police officers. Griffin offered some ideas to address the issue, but seemed to think that issue could be solved if students “understand who [police officers] are in general.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, in comparison with Ornelas, Griffin lacked the same charisma and confidence that his opponent displayed. Student leaders –– all leaders –– need to be able to inspire hope, assurance and trust in their constituents. Neither EVPLA candidates completely achieved this, but Ornelas’ personable character is an advantage he has over Griffin.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, Griffin will need to keep these concerns at the forefront of his agenda as EVPLA and if he does, there is potential for a successful EVPLA term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, neither candidate perfectly embodies the ideal candidate for this position. Although Ornelas might be more personable with constituents, his platform projects fell short of Griffin’s, and lacked concrete plans for execution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas listed some of his proposals for his term as creating a monthly farmer’s market in I.V. and special topic classes co-taught by professors and students. These ideas are not bad, but they’re not the most pressing needs of students at the moment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas seemed to have a better sense of student opinions’ on issues like police presence and sexual violence, but had little understanding of government agencies in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">believes Griffin will use his position as EVPLA to fulfill his platform and serve students to his best ability. Griffin is knowledgeable about the EVPLA office, familiar with I.V. terrain and has ideas that could really make a difference in students’ everyday lives.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Daily Nexus Editorial Board is comprised of the editor in chief and the news team. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87555\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/matthew-griffin-for-external-vice-president-for-local-affairs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87555\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/matthew-griffin-for-external-vice-president-for-local-affairs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/matthew-griffin-for-external-vice-president-for-local-affairs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/matthew-griffin-for-external-vice-president-for-local-affairs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/matthew-griffin-for-external-vice-president-for-local-affairs/","id":2087,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2086,2085,2084],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Student Advocate General: No Endorsement","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-04-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/andrewn_Max-Abrams_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/andrewn_Max-Abrams_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Nexus decided not to endorse a candidate for the S.A.G. position.

It has been shortened and lightly edited for clarity:</p>\n<p><strong>What is your name, year and major?</strong><br>\nI am a second year English major and history minor.</p>\n<p><strong>Why are you running for S.A.G.?</strong><br>\nI didn’t anticipate running for an exec position…. I thought that because I served as a senator as an off-campus Senator this year, I would retire after this year, but I figured I still had some gas in the tank and there was still a lot of work left to be done in our community. I figured it would almost be like a sell out move to just retire a little bit earlier than ahead of time.</p>\n<p><strong>What party did you run with as senator? Do you think parties should exist?</strong><br>\nIf you asked me a couple of months ago, I would say [parties] would be completely unnecessary. Now, looking back [on this] year as a whole, I think parties offer some value. I think it’s kept other senators accountable because there is this sense of competitiveness. But as a whole, I think [it has caused] a lot more friction in the organization then it needs to be.</p>\n<p><strong>Because you were involved in Campus United, are you worried that people might not think that you’re independent if you do get the position?</strong><br>\nI’m going to try to brand myself as completely unaffiliated as much as I can. But of course, no matter what you say or how much you do, there’s still people who will cast you one way or another…</p>\n<p>I thrive best in one-on-one situations, on individual scenarios, right. So even in the Senate room, I’ve tried throughout the entire year to cross the aisle per se. I love working with IVP senators. I try to cooperate and collaborate them as much as I can.</p>\n<p><strong>What are you involved with on campus that you believe makes you qualified for S.A.G.?</strong><br>\nI worked for the annual fund and as student ambassadors. So even working with a bunch of those people, you’re talking to all different parts of the campus. Other than that I’m also in the Zeta Psi fraternity. So I’m involved in the Greek community, which constitutes about 10% of our campus. [I am also in] mock trial. I did [mock trial] my freshman year and I still serve as a student coach. And so all of those organizations I think touches on these different corners of our campus. Honestly, I’m just one person and I’d love to be involved as much as I can, but I can’t [be involved in everything].</p>\n<p><strong>You are involved in Greek Life. You will most likely be dealing with a lot of cases and maybe even some against members of Greek Life. Do you feel there’s any sort of conflict of interest here, and what can you do to ease the concerns of the students on campus who don’t feel safe around Greek Life?</strong><br>\nI think my involvement in the Greek Life community actually offered me a really unique perspective. I think I could actually approach those sort of cases with less prejudice because it’s well known that there’s a stigma around a Greek life. Right? And I think that’s where a lot of biases against people that comes about. But having been in Greek life myself, I can see that there are really awesome people in Greek life. I met some of the best people I’ve ever met in my life [in Greek life]. I think [being in Greek life] allows me to approach these sort of cases, along with other communities I’m involved in, in a way that is a more compassionate than someone that isn’t.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most important aspect of being S.A.G.?</strong><br>\nI think making the resources [that are] more accessible. I know a large part of the job is to represent the students interests in terms of disciplinary action. That was definitely a large part of the job. But for me and going into this election season, I really want to emphasize my passion for making a lot of the resources on campus more accessible, [because] at least from my experience, a large part of these resources exist in the first place is because it became clear that a lot of students need things like the Food Bank, but [some students] don’t know that these resources exist.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any specific projects that you’re interested in working on while S.A.G.?</strong><br>\nI was talking to Jack Tannenbaum [Editor’s Note: Tannenbaum was the 2017-2018 S.A.G.] who was working on [a poll project] throughout the entire year. It was to collect data from the student body, especially from people who aren’t involved in A.S. through the outreach.</p>\n<p>I would love to take on that project, but to build upon it. Tabling, going door to door and through basic face interactions to get students actually really thinking about this thing critically. So [I want to] collect that data and then bring it to the Senate and then say, ‘That this is what the student prioritize.’ I think that is the best way to first determine what the students want. And then from there working with my team to figure out how to make those resources more visible. I can’t do this [alone] obviously. But to work with the cabinet, along with the 24 senators that are about to get elected, I think we do some real damage.</p>\n<p><strong>What would you look for in hiring caseworkers, in members of your office? What are some qualities you’d look for?</strong><br>\nThis is arguably thing I thought about most… I’m really looking forward [to working with a team] and my team will have eagerness and a passion for [the office]. I’m looking for people who will approach these cases with a sense of humanity and compassion that I think the OSA requires a level of empathy that I think students deserve. So that’s the thing I’m really looking for, goodhearted people who care, but [also] have this really special level of compassion for others.</p>\n<p><strong>Example: Say there is an incident where someone says that you are not doing your job correctly. How would you respond to that?</strong><br>\nListen to them, for starters. I think from my experience as a senator and [from] my leadership experience in high school, it’s much harder to sit down and listen to what someone has to say to you, especially when it’s not convenient. So that’s the first thing I’d do. I would listen and see where they’re coming from and then work with them to see how we can better.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have experience working with people in the administration? People like Katya Armistead, Margaret Klawunn, etc.?</strong><br>\nNo, I don’t actually. So a lot of this will be new and a lot of it is very daunting. But the team that I’m hoping to create, I am looking for people who were experienced in working with those sorts of figures. So, I mean, a lot of what you just said seemed daunting.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think you’re prepared for this position?</strong><br>\nI mean, I’m here right now. I think so. I’m hopeful more than I am [prepared]. I am frightened, but I am a human being, so a lot of nights I do stay up thinking about it to see if I’m ready. But I think a large part of me, like I said, is really excited, but [there is] that part that is scared. I think I even find value in that.</p>\n<p>I think it means I’m not stupid. I am trying to be really delicate and really critical about the things I say. I understand the gravity of this position.</p>\n<p><strong>How would you uphold that confidentiality?</strong><br>\nI think the major thing is to emphasize [confidentiality] with my case workers because they’re the ones that are also seeing the case. And for me personally, I’ve dealt with confidentiality. Just being a senator, we have to uphold confidentiality with, especially with Title IX reports.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think can be most improved around campus?</strong><br>\nI think the major thing I’m focused on is the visibility and access to resources. [Hearing] from my friends and my constituents as the senator right now, people just don’t know they exist. That would be the thing that would be most improved. Like I said, just highlighting those sort of resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Legal Code states that the S.A.G. is expected to “Educate the student body about student’s rights, University and Associated Students policies, laws, regulations, procedures, and promote awareness of the availability of support and assistance services offered both by the OSA, Associated Students, and the University at large.” How would you go about doing that?</strong><br>\nYeah, so I know workshops are also very good way to go about that. I think a lot of students are interested in the rights that they have. I think once I have been making myself visible and I have a good amount of influence on the community at large, I think pushing these workshops that educate people on their student rights [would] be really helpful.</p>\n<p><strong>Where do you think your personal identity intersects with your professional duty to represent students, especially those of historically underrepresented communities? How do you think your identity will play a role in your position as S.A.G. if elected?</strong><br>\nWell, I’m a second generation American. My parents migrated over to America in 1979 and so growing up, I have definitely been somebody who has experienced and been exposed to a lot of <em>microaggressions.</em> Absolutely. But to say that I have been largely marginalized and I think would be to invalidate the narratives of so many other people. I don’t plan on casting myself as someone by a marginalized narrative, but I do have a sense of what that feels to be a second generation American.</p>\n<p><strong>How would you go about choosing your team?</strong><br>\nSo I would send out an application. An online application that asks what organizations they’re part of. That’s major, that very basic stuff. Right. And then once they come to interview, I kind of have to ask them, um, [a lot of] sorts of questions. Quite honestly, [I want] just to see different personalities in work.</p>\n<p><em>The </em>Daily Nexus<em> Editorial Board is comprised of the editor in chief and the news team</em>.</p>\n<p><i>Correction [11:10 p.m.]: Nguyen said he originally thought A.S. political parties were “unnecessary,” not “necessary.” This article has been updated to reflect that. </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87562\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/student-advocate-general-no-endorsement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87562\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/student-advocate-general-no-endorsement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/student-advocate-general-no-endorsement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/student-advocate-general-no-endorsement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/student-advocate-general-no-endorsement/","id":2088,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2087,2086,2085],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Projected Top Five Picks of the  NFL Draft: Jaguars Grab Teddy Bridgewater First","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Sports-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Sports-art.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Jaguars Grab Teddy Bridgewater First","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Jacksonville Jaguars — Teddy Bridgewater, QB, Louisville</p>\n<p>Jacksonville’s woes don’t figure to end at any point. The problems start with the quarterback, where Blaine Gabbert and Chad Henne have been the two worst in the league for years. A “face-of-the-franchise” signal-caller like Bridgewater will be the centerpiece of the rebuilding effort. In a draft with the deepest class of QB’s in recent memory, Bridgewater stands above the rest. Although he doesn’t have any skills that are considered elite, his intelligence, decision-making, strength, accurate arm and athleticism combine for an immediate NFL starter.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers — Jadeveon Clowney, DE, South Carolina</p>\n<p>The Bucs had high hopes entering the season, but injuries decimated the skill positions on offense, and quarterback Josh Freeman did not have the bounce-back season many had hoped for. Instead, Freeman is now a benchwarmer for the Minnesota Vikings, leaving Vincent Jackson and Mike Glennon as the only notable players on a porous offense. The defense is actually alright, especially against the run. Clowney is far and away the best player in the draft, and the only way he doesn’t go to the Bucs here is via a trade. An elite pass rusher is the only missing ingredient from this defense and would be exactly what Tampa Bay needs to get back to their smash-mouth, physical style that took them to the Super Bowl over a decade ago.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Minnesota Vikings — Marcus Mariota, QB, Oregon</p>\n<p>The signing of Josh Freeman signifies the end of the Christian Ponder era in Minnesota. However, after Freeman’s cringe-worthy debut for the Purple People Eaters, it is clear that their franchise QB is not on this roster at the moment. Enter Mariota. The redshirt sophomore phenom is skyrocketing up draft boards and is now being ranked even higher than Teddy Bridgewater. Mariota’s 95.5 Total Quarterback Rating is tops in the nation and better than all of the last four Heisman-winning quarterbacks. He has elite athleticism comparable to Robert Griffin III, and this season he has added the ability to throw deep passes down the sidelines. Bridgewater is considered more of a sure thing, and thus more likely to go number one. But Mariota has the highest upside of any offensive player in the draft and has a chance to leapfrog into the number one spot.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>New York Giants — Jake Matthews, OT, Texas A&amp;M</p>\n<p>Through the first six games of the season, New York was historically awful, even giving the Jaguars a run for their money as worst in the league. They seemed to have turned it around a bit, although their only two wins have come against a demoralized Vikings team and a beat-up Eagles team. Their point differential and unbalanced team composition are the makeup for a terrible team, and they need to add some great role players to contend next year. A franchise left tackle like Matthews would help protect Eli Manning, restore the capacity to utilize Victor Cruz and Hakeem Nicks and rejuvenate the worst running game in football. A playmaker on defense is also a possibility, but I expect NY to look to improve an offense that earlier in the season got shut out by the Carolina Panthers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Houston Texans — Sammy Watkins, WR, Clemson</p>\n<p>This would be the pick if the season ended today and no trades were made, but I don’t expect it to actually shape up this way. Houston needs a quarterback, but with Mariota and Bridgewater off the board, there is no player worthy of a top five pick. I expect Houston to trade down and go after someone like Brett Hundley, Tajh Boyd or Johnny Manziel. However, all this considered, Watkins would be a solid pick for the Texans here. An explosive playmaker on offense, Watkins has the potential of an elite number one to take the place of the slowing Andre Johnson. He does incredible things after the catch and is showing the technical ability to be a reliable, go-to threat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 29th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Vicky Kohatsu of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52660\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-jaguars-grab-teddy-bridgewater-first/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52660\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-jaguars-grab-teddy-bridgewater-first/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-jaguars-grab-teddy-bridgewater-first/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-jaguars-grab-teddy-bridgewater-first/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-jaguars-grab-teddy-bridgewater-first/","id":2086,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[2085,2084,2083],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
