For freshman Josh McNeely, fall quarter of his first collegiate year has brought a much bigger challenge: manning the starting goalkeeper spot for one of the biggest collegiate soccer programs in the nation.</p>\n<p>An undeclared major, McNeely has helped UCSB win five straight matches, and has proven that even freshmen can come into college and immediately become the big man on campus.</p>\n<p>“[Starting as a freshman is] definitely a big honor. I wasn’t really expecting it coming into this year, but I’ve just tried to work hard and earn a spot and do what I can in the games to help our team win,” McNeely said. “It’s definitely something that’s been really exciting and something that I’ve worked for my whole life.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Soccer came naturally early on to McNeely as he began playing at the age of four amongst a number of other sports. However, soccer always stood out to Josh as his favorite and the one he was best at.</p>\n<p>By age 10, McNeely made the part-time transition to goalkeeper, a move that became permanent at the age of 12.</p>\n<p>“I started playing goalkeeper when I was around 10, which is kind of late,” McNeely said. “My coach put me in there because I was one of the biggest guys on the team. Just making big saves in big games attracted me to the position.”</p>\n<p>Although his move to goalkeeper may have been purely random based on his size, McNeely immediately showed he had a knack for the position.</p>\n<p>His U-16 squad won the U.S. Soccer Academy National Championship, a personal highlight of McNeely’s youth career. Perhaps his most influential moments in youth soccer however came from his training with the Los Angeles Galaxy Academy. While there, he learned from Ian Feuer, current goalkeeper coach for the Galaxy and former MLS and English Premier League goalie.</p>\n<p>“He definitely was a mentor and a great coach growing up,” McNeely said. “He taught me most of what I know about goalkeeping and the position, everything from technique to the mental part of the game. He’s definitely a big reason why I’m still playing today at this level.”</p>\n<p>Growing up in Calabasas, a mere hour from Santa Barbara, McNeely had familiarity with both Santa Barbara and UCSB Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg. Josh’s parents were family friends with Vom Steeg’s sister-in-law, a coincidence that put McNeely on UCSB’s radar since he was 12.</p>\n<p>“When Josh was a young player, I would hear stories from my sister-in-law that her friend’s son was a really good soccer player. The funny part is that you hear that story quite a bit,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>McNeely committed to attend UCSB his junior year of high school, attributing the weather, location, atmosphere and large and successful soccer program for bringing him an hour north of his childhood.</p>\n<p>As coincidence would have it again, McNeely came to Santa Barbara with a fellow impact freshman in midfielder Drew Murphy, with whom Josh had played against growing up since the age of nine until they played on the same Galaxy team at 14.</p>\n<p>“The Galaxy both called us in when we were 14. And it’s funny going from rivals to being good friends on the same team,” Murphy said. “Josh, when we were little, I would like to say he was a knucklehead because of the rivalry.”</p>\n<p>Now in Santa Barbara, McNeely has risen to the challenge of starting as a true freshman, allowing only eight goals in 11 starts, four of which were shutouts. UCSB has won eight of Josh’s 11 starts and seems to have finally found its groove with its first year goalkeeper.</p>\n<p>“He’s been able to avoid mistakes and that’s kind of the real key right now. Every game that goes by, I think he gains some real confidence,” Vom Steeg said. “He has the respect of the players in front of him, he has the respect of the team.”</p>\n<p>With a senior-led backline, the Gauchos defense has been the anchor of the team the entire season, a statement made that much more accurate with McNeely’s emergence. During the first week of conference play, McNeely garnered Big West Defensive Player of the Week honors, and helped lead UCSB to four straight victories to open conference play.</p>\n<p>Already in his first two months in college, McNeely has shown he has all the tools necessary to help UCSB achieve its goal of winning the Big West crown.</p>\n<p>“The good thing about Josh is he’s very humble, he takes a workmanlike approach. I think he has the right mentality and temperament,” Vom Steeg said. “He’s a calm player; he doesn’t play nervous even if he is nervous. Those are all characteristics that can take you far.”</p>\n<p>While McNeely wants to improve as a player during college, his ultimate dream is to play professionally, either overseas or in the U.S.</p>\n<p>“Without a doubt [he’ll play professionally], I don’t even think that’s a question at this point. He has all the tools he needs and it’s just up to him whether or not he wants to,” Murphy said. “As a goalie, it takes a lot more time than a field player. The pro game will without a doubt be in his future at some point.”</p>\n<p>The way McNeely has handled the pressure as not only the starting goalkeeper for UCSB but as a freshman transitioning to college, makes his future in Santa Barbara and beyond looks promising.</p>\n<p>With McNeely between the posts this season and hopefully for the next three after, the Gauchos possess one of the most promising defensive players in the entire country.</p>\n<p>“He has the skill set to play at the next level. He has the right temperament to play goalkeeper at the next level,” Vom Steeg said. “The question is going to be what he puts into it.”</p>\n<p>UCSB continues play Saturday when they face UC Davis on the road for a 3 p.m. kickoff.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of October 16, 2013’s print edition of <em>The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>Photo Courtesy of UCSB Athletics.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52488\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/opponents-fear-the-freshman/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52488\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/opponents-fear-the-freshman/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/opponents-fear-the-freshman/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/opponents-fear-the-freshman/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/opponents-fear-the-freshman/","id":1608,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1607,1606,1605],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[254,318,354,366,518,519,527,533,535,538,539,546,548,551,554,555,558,561,567,570,574,576,577,578,589,592,594,596,605,609,613,618,623,630,633,638,640,647,650,651,653,654,656,660,661,668,670,673,677,683,694,700,703,706,708,710,717,719,724,727,798,809,814,828,833,847,849,851,853,854,856,857,858,863,867,868,870,874,877,879,880,882,884,886,887,889,892,894,899,900,902,904,905,915,920,1259,1565,1566,1567,1568,1569,1570,1571,1575,1578,1581,1583,1584,1587,1590,1591,1594,1599,1601,1603,1606,1607,1608,1611,1623,1626,1652,1666,1668,1669,1670,1674,1675,1685,1689,1691,1692,1697,1762,1763,1765,2063,2069,2095,2142,2158,3169,3185,3190,3226,3229,3231,3232,3238,3244,3249,3256,4448,4494,4522,4523,4524,4526,4531,4539,4541,4544,4545,4546,4549,4550,4551,4554,4567,5189,5193,5194,5209,5396,5399,5400,5402,5403,5404,5405,5406,5407,5409,5417,5418,5419,5420,5421,5422,5423,5424,5425,5426,5427,5428,5429,5430,5431,5436,5448,5449,5450,5502,5530,5536],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Fighting to Stay Undefeated","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.4.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-23.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.4.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-23.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB takes on Cal State Northridge on the road","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Rare are the opportunities when a team has a chance to make a statement with one victory and establish itself as the team to beat in its conference.

If we don’t score, we make sure the other team doesn’t score, so that’s been our main focus.”</p>\n<p>That Northridge offense features the second and third leading goal-scorers in the conference in junior forward Sagi Lev-Ari (eight goals) and senior forward Brian Behrad (six goals).</p>\n<p>UCSB is no slouch offensively, however, featuring two seniors, midfielder Goffin Boyoko and forward Achille Campion, whose four goals are tied for seventh in the conference. Jome also ranks tied for third in the Big West with five assists on the season.</p>\n<p>When the Gauchos finish what is sure to be an emotional game against Northridge, they must immediately turn their focus to an up-and-down Irvine squad that enters the contest with a 6-3-2 overall record and 1-1 mark in conference.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters began conference play with a loss at UC Davis before rebounding with a victory against Sacramento State on Sunday. Irvine will also host Cal Poly Friday night before facing UCSB Sunday.</p>\n<p>This weekend looks to be a pivotal one for the Gauchos, with the match against Northridge looming especially large.</p>\n<p>“It’s as big as any game in conference, there’s no bigger game,” Campion said. “Let’s make a statement and go beat them.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s match is scheduled for a 7 p.m. start time at Matador Soccer Field while Sunday’s game against Irvine has a 4 p.m. kickoff at Anteater Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em> A version of this article appeared on page 1 of October 10th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52416\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/fighting-to-stay-undefeated/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52416\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/fighting-to-stay-undefeated/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/fighting-to-stay-undefeated/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/fighting-to-stay-undefeated/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/fighting-to-stay-undefeated/","id":1607,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1606,1605,1604],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Prevails in Two Overtime Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.6.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-3.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.6.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-3.jpeg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeats No. 4 Northridge, Irvine on the road.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Dramatic endings are becoming a common theme for the UCSB men’s soccer team and luckily for the Gauchos, they are finding themselves on the right side of those endings.

Following sophomore defender Marshall Cazares’ pair of yellow cards in the 53rd minute, the Gauchos were left one man down.</p>\n<p>The disadvantage did not stop UCSB, however, as junior forward Reed McKenna notched the game at 1-1 with a 62nd minute goal that flew between the goalkeeper and the left post for his first career goal. Freshman midfielder Drew Murphy contributed on the play for his team-leading sixth assist on the season.</p>\n<p>“We never give up and even people that aren’t used to stepping up stepped up today,” Campion said.</p>\n<p>After a scoreless rest of the second half and first overtime, the Gauchos received another goal from an even more unlikely source in junior defender Kevin Garcia-Lopez. Garcia-Lopez received the ball on the other side of the field and dribbled all the way to the goal, sending a shot inside the right post for the golden goal.</p>\n<p>Irvine fell to 7-4-2 on the season and 2-2 in conference, defeating Cal Poly 2-0 on Friday night before facing UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Today was as improbable as it gets. We had a defender pick up a ball 70 yards away from goal and score,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Literally in all my years in soccer I don’t know if I can recall a play like that, it was really unbelievable.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s contest proved to be equally dramatic as the Gauchos faced the highest ranked opponent they have faced all season in No. 4 Northridge.</p>\n<p>UCSB fell behind 1-0 before defender Peter Schmetz recorded his third goal of the season with little time to spare in the 87th minute. Murphy assisted on the goal for his fifth of the season.</p>\n<p>Campion then gave UCSB an important victory over a ranked opponent with a successful penalty kick in the 100th minute. Northridge raised its record to 11-2 and 3-1 in the Big West after defeating Cal Poly Sunday.</p>\n<p>“We played two really tough games against two good teams on the road,” Vom Steeg said. “I thought we played fairly well on Friday night and it was great that we were able to win. The game tonight we didn’t play well at all but again still found a way to win. Everyone’s pretty proud of where things are right now.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next faces UC Davis on Saturday for a 3 p.m. start. The Gauchos hold a two-game advantage over second place Davis in the Big West North.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 14, 2013’s print edition of <em>The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em></em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of <em>The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52454\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-14/ucsb-prevails-in-two-overtime-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52454\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-14/ucsb-prevails-in-two-overtime-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-14/ucsb-prevails-in-two-overtime-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-14/ucsb-prevails-in-two-overtime-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-14/ucsb-prevails-in-two-overtime-matches/","id":1606,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1605,1604,1603],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Travel to Hawaii For First Road Trip of Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_00.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_00.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB preview at Hawaii","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Despite travelling to Hawaii today, it will be all business for the UCSB women’s soccer team, which seeks a result in a pivotal match early in the conference season.

When UCSB went on a five-game winning streak earlier in the season, her clean sheets in all those games were the most consecutive shutouts by a UCSB goalkeeper since 1989.</p>\n<p>“We’re not terribly surprised, but the fact that she stepped in with little or no experience has been huge,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “Just to have her step in and have her do as well as she did just from the word ‘go’ has been great.”</p>\n<p>Prior to the team’s last loss on Sunday versus Long Beach State, junior midfielder Madison Beckley had been red hot playing up top for UCSB. Beckley notched the only goal in Friday’s win against Irvine, bringing her goal total to five, the most on the team. Aside from her goals, Beckley has been creating scoring chances for the Gauchos by recording two assists, tied second on the team.</p>\n<p>Hawaii will rely on its home crowd for tonight’s matchup. Last season, the Rainbow Wahine were not able to win a conference game on the road, yet only lost one league game when playing in Hawaii. A key point of emphasis for Santa Barbara will be the passing game. Turnovers by way of errant passes derailed the Gauchos offensive opportunities in its last lost.</p>\n<p>“[The game plan] doesn’t really change terribly. We want to do what we do well,” Stumpf said. “Some of the goals we have is we want to possess the ball 65 percent of the game or more, we want to create more chances for ourselves.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will have to be on lookout for junior forward Tiana Fujimoto who has scored six goals on the season, second in the league, and is the Warrior’s main threat on offense.</p>\n<p>Once the Gauchos finish playing the Warriors, they will head back to California for a matchup against Cal State Northridge (5-7-1 overall, 0-1-1 conference). Despite the long distance traveled in few days, the players are set on playing at the same level of intensity.</p>\n<p>“We have that Friday, Saturday gap so I don’t think we’ll be that concerned with Sunday’s game,” sophomore forward Angelisa Cortez said. “It’s about mentality, so you got to go out there and think [you’re] going to win.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore goalkeeper Cynthia Tafoya will guard the back of the net for the Matadors and will present trouble for UCSB offensively; her 44 saves on the season are fifth in the league.</p>\n<p>Kickoff for tonight’s match against Hawaii is scheduled for 10 p.m. and Sunday’s game at Cal State Northridge will begin at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of October 10th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52414\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/gauchos-travel-to-hawaii-for-first-road-trip-of-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52414\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/gauchos-travel-to-hawaii-for-first-road-trip-of-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/gauchos-travel-to-hawaii-for-first-road-trip-of-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/gauchos-travel-to-hawaii-for-first-road-trip-of-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/gauchos-travel-to-hawaii-for-first-road-trip-of-season/","id":1605,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1604,1603,1602],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
