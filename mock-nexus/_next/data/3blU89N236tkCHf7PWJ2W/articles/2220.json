Halloween celebrations by publicizing testimonials from regretful Halloween party attendees of the past on various social media platforms, as seen in past and current advertisements.</p>\n<p>The funding for ads decreased from 2017 to 2018, according to Estrada.</p>\n<p>Halloween in 2016 and 2017 saw a significant decrease in police presence. This is part of a noticeable downward trend in the number of police in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Halloweens in 2013 and 2014 saw heavy reports of damage and arrests in I.V. as previously reported on by the Nexus.</p>\n<p>Multiple deputies will be deployed on foot this weekend to the busier streets including Del Playa Drive, Trigo Road and Sabado Tarde, according to Sergeant Daniel Calderon from the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP).</p>\n<p>In anticipation of large crowds, both IVFP and University of California Police Department (UCPD) have increased their available staff, according to Sgt. Calderon.</p>\n<p>The safety of the UCSB’s campus was also a concern this past weekend as a result of Delirium and the soccer game against California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.</p>\n<p>“We’re responsible for the security and safety of the campus, regardless of what’s going on. We are responsive to the crowds and the demeanor and the total activity that is going on,” IVFP Lieutenant Dave Millard said.</p>\n<p>Metal detectors were present at Delirium as part of the security screening at the request of the Thunderdome department.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) reported six citations for minor in possession, four for open container and two for loud music, according to a SBSO representative who attended the I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting on Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>Police issued other citations for public urination, violation of the outdoor festival ordinance and unlicensed driving. Three people were arrested for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>A total of 27 citations and eight arrests were made on Friday and Saturday, according to Kelly Hoover, SBSO spokesperson. This number includes citations and arrests made by both SBSO and the UCPD.</p>\n<p>UCPD made five arrests on campus and issued three citations. One person was medically transported for alcohol intoxication on Friday.</p>\n<p>UCPD primarily patrolled campus property and the business district and SBSO patrolled the rest of I.V. during this past weekend, according to Hoover.</p>\n<p>The numbers are similar to last year, when only 25 citations and arrests were made during Halloween weekend by both departments.</p>\n<p>The post-Halloween weekend is expected to be quiet as well. The festival ordinance, preventing loud music or noise, is in effect until Nov. 4. Parking restrictions end on Halloween.</p>\n<p>“That is lower than some typical Friday or Saturday nights in Isla Vista,” Hoover said in an email. “Thanks to everyone for making this a safe and uneventful weekend.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

id=\"caption-attachment-84667\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sweet said he has been barred from entering campus. <em>Courtesy of UCSB Faculty Page</em></p></div>\n<p>Sweet’s leave of absence comes after a junior faculty member and an undergraduate summer trainee filed a complaint against him regarding an interaction in July of this year.</p>\n<p>Sweet detailed the interaction and his difficulties dealing with the UCSB administration in a Facebook post on Oct. 13.</p>\n<p>“A junior faculty member got a key to my locked graduate student office room and put one of his off-campus undergraduate summer trainees at the desk of one of my graduate students, displacing her private materials,” Sweet said in the Facebook post.</p>\n<p>Noticing the unlocked office, Sweet requested the undergraduate trainee leave the graduate student’s office.</p>\n<p>“I informed [the junior faculty member] of department policy on secure offices for grad students, and copied my department chair, late afternoon,” Sweet said. “She replied that she’d sort it out, and next morning sent an email telling [the junior faculty member] he was out of line, and that I had responded appropriately.”</p>\n<p>Sweet believed the issue was resolved at the time, but the administration presented a formal charge against him and suspended him approximately two and a half months later.</p>\n<p>According to Sweet’s personal inquiry into the matter, the details of the complaint were not the same as Sweet’s understanding of the encounter.</p>\n<p>Sweet was allegedly told that he “stalked” the female undergraduate trainee, “waited until she was alone” and “harassed and bullied her” before she fled, according to Sweet’s Facebook post.</p>\n<p>“The allegation and all of its add-ons are just flat out false,” he said.</p>\n<p>As of late October, Sweet is unable to access his on-campus office and teach classes.</p>\n<p>In an updated Facebook post on Oct. 24, Sweet said one of his courses is canceled and the other is being taught by a grad student.</p>\n<p>“I think this is an example of how hypersensitivity to sexual harassment can be used unfairly to try to settle scores,” Sweet said. “I don’t know what score is being settled here, but it is causing a lot of disruption, not simply to my good name.”</p>\n<p>“I am aware that former students and scientific colleagues worldwide have reacted with incredulity… UCSB is getting a monstrous black eye over this.”</p>\n<p>UCSB did not offer an official statement regarding Sweet’s case.</p>\n<p>Sweet’s full Facebook post can be viewed <a

Attorney General, said in the meeting minutes.</p>\n<p>The External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) position was left vacant after the disqualification of EVPSA-elect Mayela Morales last spring.</p>\n<p>At the Oct. 25 meeting, Madeline Loudon, the sole candidate for the EVPSA position, argued that the threshold was unlikely to be met.</p>\n<p>Loudon was the runner-up in the Spring 2018 Election.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been campaigning on this campus for three years now and I know the feasibility of trying to get students to turnout and I know how apathetic students can be. I believe that we are not going to hit the threshold by the second date for sure,” Loudon said.</p>\n<p>In the meeting minutes, Elections Board Member Andrew Yan noted that the office would still be able to function without the External Vice President For Statewide Affairs (EVPSA).</p>\n<p>“There are mechanisms that allow the EVPSA office to continue if that position remains vacant,” Diana Collins Puente, Elections Board advisor, said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate passed a resolution over the summer to allow the duties and funds of the office to be split, stating that a bulk of the position’s duties began over the summer as opposed to Fall Quarter.</p>\n<p>At the Oct. 24 Senate meeting, Alexandra Gessesse, who has been fulfilling some of the duties of the EVPSA in her position as campaign organizing director, urged the Senate to encourage their constituents to vote.</p>\n<p>“We still haven’t met the threshold, and our office is starting to [get] our nose deep in work regarding requisition forms and things like that,” she said. “We don’t have an EVPSA, and we won’t have one for the entire year, and that’ll be really hard for our office.”</p>\n<p>“Campaign as if you were campaigning for yourself.”</p>\n<p>While Elections Board decided against halving the threshold for the time being, they are putting their efforts toward their “Get Out The Vote” campaign by setting up a voting booth at Pardall Center and a mobile voting booth on campus.</p>\n<p>They also partnered with the A.S. Ticket Office to send an email to students who purchased tickets to the annual Delirium concert put on by A.S. Program Board.</p>\n<p>Loudon did not appear to be actively campaigning by the time Elections Board held their Oct. 11 meeting and was unable to make it to the candidate forum on Oct. 5.</p>\n<p>If the minimum voting threshold is not reached, the EVPSA position will remain vacant until the Spring Quarter 2019 elections.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Nov. 3]: This article was updated to include information about the second extension of the deadline. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-70795\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Doe’s suspension was reversed earlier this month. <em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The case, <em>John Doe</em> v. <em>University of California Regents</em>, focuses on two students referred to as Jane Roe and John Doe in court documents.</p>\n<p>Doe was officially suspended from UCSB in 2016 after Roe accused him of sexually assaulting her on June 26, 2015.</p>\n<p>UCSB placed Doe on interim suspension beginning Sept. 16, 2015, while the school investigated Roe’s claim. He was officially suspended for eight quarters following a hearing from the Sexual/Interpersonal Violence Conduct Committee.</p>\n<p>Two weeks ago, the SB Superior Court court found that Doe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>was denied access to critical evidence – a copy of a report that described Roe’s alleged injuries following the assault – during the hearing;</li>\n<li>was denied the opportunity to “adequately cross-examine witnesses,” including Roe herself and Doe’s mother, among others;</li>\n<li>and was denied the opportunity to present evidence, such as information regarding Roe’s antidepressant medication, in his defense.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“It is ironic that an institution of higher learning, where American history and government are taught, should stray so far from the principles that underlie our democracy,” court documents read.</p>\n<p>Doe will be rewarded some form of compensation, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>This is the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-08-15/uc-regents-found-in-contempt-of-court-expelled-student-allowed-to-return-to-ucsb/\">second reversal</a> of a UCSB Title IX case the <em>Nexus</em> has reported on in recent months.</p>\n<p><strong>JANE ROE</strong></p>\n<p>Roe said Doe sexually assaulted her that night at Doe’s girlfriend’s apartment. Doe’s girlfriend is referred to in court documents as Eyewitness One.</p>\n<p>Roe had consumed wine, beer and mango margaritas that night and said she had felt “pretty drunk” and decided to sleep on the bottom bunk of a bunk bed in the apartment’s living room.</p>\n<p>She stated she woke at an unknown time, “completely disoriented,” to an “intense, throbbing pain.”</p>\n<p>Roe said she pretended to be asleep because she did not want a confrontation while her assaulter allegedly “unhooked [her] bra”; “suck[ed] and bit” her for several minutes; “[took] photos of her naked breasts” and repeatedly “penetrated [her] vagina and anus” with his fingers and/or penis.</p>\n<p>She said she realized it was Doe when her assaulter stopped and got up from the bed, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>Roe was medically examined by the Santa Barbara County Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) two days after the alleged assault.</p>\n<p>The SART report said there was “bruising and laceration noted in the anal area,” according to University of California Police Department (UCPD) Detective Dawn Arviso.</p>\n<p>However, neither Roe nor the detective provided a full copy of the SART report with this information attached during the trial.</p>\n<p>“The SART report was critical evidence,” court documents state. “At a minimum UCSB should have required the detective to provide a complete copy of the SART report.”</p>\n<p>Roe’s story that night also conflicted with Eyewitness One’s report.</p>\n<p>Following the alleged assault, Roe said Eyewitness One approached the bed and screamed when she saw that Roe’s “bottom half” was completely bare.</p>\n<p>Eyewitness One testified over Skype that Roe was wearing a short-sleeve shirt and underwear when she got up from the bed, contradicting Roe’s claim. She also denied screaming.</p>\n<p>The mattress was also absent of “any visible signs or smells of bodily fluids” consistent with anal or vaginal penetration, according to Eyewitness One.</p>\n<p><strong>JOHN DOE</strong></p>\n<p>Doe denied all of Roe’s accusations.</p>\n<p>He said he arrived at the apartment at approximately 12:30 a.m. that night and was “very intoxicated.”</p>\n<p>By Eyewitness One’s recommendation, he lay down, fully dressed, on the bottom bunk next to Roe because the top bunk was covered in luggage. He reportedly first heard about Doe’s allegations when she “woke [him] up by basically yelling about someone hurting her.”</p>\n<p>He argued three main points in his defense:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The distance between the couch and the bunk bed in the living room was too close for him to have done anything without being noticed by Eyewitness One and Eyewitness Two.</li>\n<li>He could not have unhooked Roe’s bra because his neurological disorder, a “form of palsy,” affects his motor skills when he is tired or drunk.</li>\n<li>Roe’s antidepressant medication, Viibryd, has side effects including hallucinations, sleep paralysis and night terrors, which can become severe when mixed with alcohol.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Doe was not allowed to include the antidepressant medication evidence in his defense because he did not have an expert present, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>The SB Superior Court stated he was not given enough time to find an expert, again showing a lack of due process.</p>\n<p>The full court documents can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/B283229.pdf\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
