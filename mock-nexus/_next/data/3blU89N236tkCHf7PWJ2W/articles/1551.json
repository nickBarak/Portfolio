Northridge dropped each of its two games over the weekend, falling to 4-6-1 overall and 0-2 in Big West. The Anteaters, who were undefeated coming into the weekend, failed to win in their two conference opening games and fell to 8-1-2 overall and 0-1-1 in the conference.</p>\n<p>“I can’t think of a better way to finish the first week of conference,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We’ve been playing generally pretty well so far this season, but now it’s about getting results. We’ve been successful in that area recently.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Irvine entered Harder Stadium an extremely confident bunch after going undefeated through its first ten games of the season, but as Vom Steeg jokingly predicted the weekend before, the Anteaters’ first loss would in fact come on Saturday in dramatic fashion.</p>\n<p>After both teams went scoreless through 89 minutes, UCSB was finally able to find the breakthrough. With just seconds left before overtime, a long ball aimed towards senior forward Reed McKenna took UCI junior goalkeeper Michael Breslin off his line to clear the ball under heavy pressure.</p>\n<p>Luckily for the Gauchos, the clearance landed right at forward Nick DePuy’s feet. The sophomore was able to control the ball before taking a touch to his left and firing a deep strike into the top left corner of the net, earning his team a shocking victory.</p>\n<p>“As soon as I hit it, I knew it was going to be a goal,” DePuy said. “I saw the keeper off his line and decided to take a shot at it. It turned out to be a pretty good move.”</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper Brandon Berke made five saves in the game, but none were more important than in the 69th minute when the Anteaters’ senior forward/midfielder Dennis Martinez found himself one-on-one with the freshman keeper. Berke smothered the chance, helping preserve the Gauchos’ second shutout of the season and bringing his record to 4-0 in starts this season.</p>\n<p>It was also the fourth game since Vom Steeg moved DePuy to starting forward, a move that seems to have paid off as UCSB has won every game since.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56498\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-4.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1610226506\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"56457\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56498\" data-attachment-id=\"56498\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/gauchos-start-perfect-for-second-year-running/msoccer_vsuci-20141004-dustinharris-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-4.jpg?fit=3384%2C2226&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3384,2226\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1412451066\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"255\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-4.jpg?fit=250%2C164&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-4.jpg?fit=888%2C584&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-56498\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MSoccer_vsUCI-20141004-DustinHarris-4-1024x673.jpg?resize=888%2C584\" alt=\"UCSB freshmen forward Ludwig Ahl (left) has scored three goals this season, including two against Drake in the previous week.

(<em>Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</em>)</p></div>\n<p>Against Northridge just two nights earlier, the Gauchos again found themselves tied late in the game.</p>\n<p>Matador freshman defender Patrick Hickman shocked UCSB’s defense when he headed in a goal off a long cross from freshman defender Gabe Robinson just eight minutes into the match, giving his team an early 1-0 advantage.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to answer just 12 minutes later, when a corner from sophomore midfielder Drew Murphy found DePuy at the far-post. DePuy was able to play a header back across goal towards junior defender/midfielder Duncan Backus who headed it in for his first goal of the season.</p>\n<p>The winner came in the 70th minute when freshman midfielder Axel Mendez found Murphy making a run down the left wing. Murphy sent a cross to the far-post to DePuy who was able to find good enough contact with the header to get it past the keeper and earn the Gauchos a 2-1 victory.</p>\n<p>“Anytime you can get a good result against a great team like Northridge, you’re happy,” Vom Steeg said. “It was a bit of a tale of two halves, but we’re improving on our game management skills and that allowed us to compete in the final 15 minutes of the game when they were trying to find a tying goal.”</p>\n<p>After notching two game-winning goals this past weekend, DePuy now leads his team with four goals on the season. Murphy, who won last week’s Big West Player of the Week award, now leads the Big West with five assists and shares team-high honors with DePuy for total points with nine.</p>\n<p>UCSB has now gone undefeated in its last twelve Big West regular season games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos return to action against Cal State Fullerton on Thursday for their first road game in a month.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56457\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/gauchos-start-perfect-for-second-year-running/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56457\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/gauchos-start-perfect-for-second-year-running/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/gauchos-start-perfect-for-second-year-running/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/gauchos-start-perfect-for-second-year-running/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/gauchos-start-perfect-for-second-year-running/","id":1551,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1550,1549,1548],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson","biography":"Not available","articles":[121,137,246,247,249,250,342,355,358,359,360,377,378,380,384,386,390,394,397,399,400,404,405,413,415,417,418,421,428,432,435,436,438,443,445,459,460,462,463,464,466,469,475,477,480,482,483,486,495,497,498,499,500,501,505,545,599,843,967,968,971,982,984,985,986,987,988,989,990,991,992,993,994,995,1016,1017,1019,1020,1021,1023,1024,1025,1107,1147,1173,1198,1400,1462,1463,1464,1469,1470,1471,1472,1474,1476,1477,1478,1481,1482,1483,1485,1486,1487,1495,1498,1501,1502,1504,1507,1508,1509,1510,1511,1514,1516,1517,1519,1521,1523,1525,1533,1534,1535,1536,1537,1538,1543,1544,1545,1546,1547,1548,1551,1552,1553,1556,1557,1559,1985,1994,1999,2028,2033,2039,2066,3210,3219,3230,3241,3258,3285,3289,3291,3295,5051,5065,5067,5078,5083,5084,5086,5087,5090,5091,5092,5093,5094,5095,5096,5099,5100,5243,5262,5276,5277,5278,5279,5280,5281,5282,5283,5284,5285,5286,5288,5293,5305,5306,5308,5309,5312,5313],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Hot Gaucho Squad Ready for Big West Play","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Womens-soccer-versus-Duquesne-first-goal-by-Kenneth-Song.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Womens-soccer-versus-Duquesne-first-goal-by-Kenneth-Song.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Women's soccer begins Big West with home and away game this weekend.

This offensive outburst has helped to increase their goals per game to two this season.</p>\n<p>The offensive attack has been guided by junior midfield/forward Angelisa Cortez who now leads the Gauchos with four goals and three assists on the season. In addition, senior midfield/forward Indiana Mead has been coming into form as she has notched a goal and two assists over the last two games.</p>\n<p>“I think we have been creating more chances in the final third,” Mead said. “This has given us more opportunities to score and we have done just that.”</p>\n<p>On the defensive side for the Gauchos, junior goalkeeper Beth Ritter should be ready to start this weekend after having sat out the previous game against Duquesne. Ritter is posting a GAA of only 0.76, which is the lowest in school history.</p>\n<p>“We have worked really hard in practice, and our confidence level is pretty high right now,” Ritter said. “Although I try not to get too comfortable, it definitely takes a little pressure off when the offense scores so many goals.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos seem to be firing on all cylinders, Cal State Northridge has continued to struggle. Losers of their past two games, the Matadors have scored only eight goals in 11 games and give up an average of 1.16 goals per contest.</p>\n<p>Piloted by senior defender Leandra Walker, who leads the team with two goals on the season, the Matadors will need to create more opportunities if they look to keep up with the Gauchos blistering offense.</p>\n<p>Long Beach State should prove to be the tougher of the two opponents this weekend. Freshman striker Ashley Gonzales has recorded an impressive five goals and two assists this season, as the 49ers average 1.09 goals scored per match.</p>\n<p>UCSB will kick off against Cal State Northridge on Friday at Harder Stadium at 7 p.m. before heading to Long Beach State for their match on Sunday at 6 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 2, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56343\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/hot-gaucho-squad-ready-for-big-west-play/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56343\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/hot-gaucho-squad-ready-for-big-west-play/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/hot-gaucho-squad-ready-for-big-west-play/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/hot-gaucho-squad-ready-for-big-west-play/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/hot-gaucho-squad-ready-for-big-west-play/","id":1550,"author":{"id":66,"name":"Martin Cobos"},"related":[1549,1548,1547],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Santa Barbara Tries to Keep Hot Streak Alive Against Duquesne","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/W-Soccer-Cedar-Lay.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/W-Soccer-Cedar-Lay.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB looks for a repeat performance against Duquesne after scoring six goals last week.

Ritter is currently posting a goals against average (GAA) of only 0.76 this season, compared to 0.87 last season, and has compiled a total of 27 saves. With a strong core of defenders to couple Ritter’s play, the UCSB women’s soccer team has notched five shutouts in only 10 games.</p>\n<p>“So far we have been really happy that we have been heading uphill on our journey to conference,” Ritter said. “We need to keep proving to ourselves that we can score goals.”</p>\n<p>With an impressive scoring outburst this past weekend, the Gauchos have improved their goals per game to 1.8 on the season. Junior midfielder/forward Angelisa Cortez has led this scoring attack with three goals and three assists over the past three games.</p>\n<p>It will certainly be a challenge for the Gauchos to keep up their blistering scoring pace however, as Duquesne enters this contest with a very stubborn defense of its own.</p>\n<p>Senior goalkeeper Devon Tabata has only allowed six goals this season and posts a GAA of 0.79. This is due in large part to an impressive 33 saves over only seven games. Just as the Gauchos, the defense for Duquesne has also produced five shutouts.</p>\n<p>On the other side, Duquesne’s offense has struggled this season as they have scored only nine goals and have a shot percentage of just .098. Sophomore midfielder Maddie Layman has been a bright spot though, as she leads the team with three goals and a shot percentage of .231.</p>\n<p>With all signs pointing to this being a highly defensive battle, the Gauchos do have one key advantage working in their favor. The UCSB women’s soccer team will have had an entire seven days to prepare for this match, compared to only two for Duquesne.</p>\n<p>“I think [the rest] is definitely an advantage,” Ritter said. “We can get in a few more sessions and focus on the recovery and maintenance of our bodies.”</p>\n<p>The match will kick off this Sunday at Harder Stadium at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of September 25, 2014th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56201\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/santa-barbara-tries-to-keep-hot-streak-alive-against-duquesne/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56201\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/santa-barbara-tries-to-keep-hot-streak-alive-against-duquesne/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/santa-barbara-tries-to-keep-hot-streak-alive-against-duquesne/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/santa-barbara-tries-to-keep-hot-streak-alive-against-duquesne/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/santa-barbara-tries-to-keep-hot-streak-alive-against-duquesne/","id":1549,"author":{"id":66,"name":"Martin Cobos"},"related":[1548,1547,1546],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Capture Momentum With Pair of Wins","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/jomegonz.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/jomegonz.jpg?resize=980%2C625&ssl=1","description":"UCSB takes down Drake University and San Diego State to improve its record to 4-3-1.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In its final two games before the beginning of Big West play, the UCSB men’s soccer team went undefeated this weekend with a 4-1 win over Drake University and a 1-0 victory over San Diego State.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos improve to 4-3-1 on the season with their latest win over Drake on Sunday.

Pretty happy about the performance.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While getting goals on the board had been a point of emphasis for Santa Barbara this past week, that was not a problem in Sunday night’s game with Drake.</p>\n<p>It didn’t take long for the Gauchos to score as in the third minute, senior right back Kevin-Garcia Lopez made a run down the right wing before playing it across to forward Ludwig Ahl on the right side of the box. The freshman was able to keep the shot low as he placed it into the right side of the net, giving the Gauchos’ their fastest scored goal this season.</p>\n<p>“We talked about being dangerous, and I thought we were dangerous right from the get-go,” Vom Steeg said. “Our gameplan was to get on the board early and get good wide play from [Lopez] on the right and [sophomore midfielder Ismaila Jome] on the left. Sometimes you draw things up and it actually works and I tonight we got the ball in the right spots early and that first goal was really important.”</p>\n<p>UCSB kept the early pressure on and was able to capitalize off poor defending in the 21st minute. Left back Drew Murphy joined the attack before playing a 1-2 to Ahl and finding space at the edge of the box. The sophomore was then able to waltz through the defense against a weak challenge before scoring an easy tap-in goal past the keeper.</p>\n<p>“It’ll never happen again, it’s like they wanted everything but the ball,” Murphy joked. “It made me look good, a lot better than it was. I wouldn’t expect something like that again.”</p>\n<p>In the 28th minute, Murphy returned the favor, finding Ahl at the near post off a corner kick. Ahl finished it with a high, first-touch shot into the top left corner of the net, giving him a brace on the day.</p>\n<p>“[Ludwig] had the same look on Friday night and he put it over the bar, so I thought he took real good care of that thing to keep it down and tucked it in,” Vom Steeg said. “We got the ball in the right places, we put it in the right spot and I thought it was a great finish.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos ended up tacking on one more when in the 82nd minute, senior forward Reed McKenna got past his defender with a nice move on the right side of the box. He then set himself up for a shot on his favored left foot and fired it into the right corner of the net.</p>\n<p>What should have been a second straight shutout for UCSB and freshman goalkeeper Brandon Berke could not be preserved, however, as in the 85th minute, a Drake player earned a penalty after being knocked down in the box. Junior defender Alec Bartlett stepped up to put away his first goal of the season, placing his shot into the right side of the net while Berke dove the other way.</p>\n<p>In Friday’s game against San Diego State, the Gauchos shook up their lineup looking to bounce back from being shutout at home against No. 1 UCLA last week. Berke got the first start of his career at goalkeeper, filling in for injured sophomore goalkeeper Josh McNeely, and sophomore midfielder/defender Nick DePuy got the start at forward.</p>\n<p>The switch paid off, as DePuy got his team on the board in the 21st minute. A low-cross from Murphy took Aztec freshman goalkeeper Adam Allmaras off his line to slap the ball away, accidentally sending it right to DePuy, who easily put away his second goal of the season.</p>\n<p>Despite giving up three shots on goal and twelve in total, UCSB was able to earn its first shutout of the year behind Berke and his three saves. The Gauchos also had one of their most productive weekends offensively, getting off 33 shots through two games with 15 on frame.</p>\n<p>UCSB will return to action this Thursday at 7:00 p.m. when it opens up its conference schedule against Cal State Northridge.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56274\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-29/gauchos-capture-momentum-with-pair-of-wins/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56274\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-29/gauchos-capture-momentum-with-pair-of-wins/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-29/gauchos-capture-momentum-with-pair-of-wins/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-29/gauchos-capture-momentum-with-pair-of-wins/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-29/gauchos-capture-momentum-with-pair-of-wins/","id":1548,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1547,1546,1545],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
