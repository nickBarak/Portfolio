AFSCME has gone on strike three times during this period, aiming to get better pay and retirement benefits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UPTE initiated the call for Wednesday’s strike; AFSCME, as well as several United Automobile Workers 5810 (UAW) members, later joined in solidarity and support of their shared interests regarding the result of UPTE’s ongoing contract negotiations with the University of California. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our goal is to have the university recognize how important it is to us, where we’ll take a day without pay to try and get these fair wages and maintain our healthcare plan,” said Michael Holford, a member of UPTE who also works in UCSB’s Communication Services department.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of the strike, union workers made beelines around campus – from Henley Gate to Cheadle Hall – in a demand for better treatment by the UC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Babe Gonzalez, a representative for AFSCME 3229 and a Student Health employee, said the UC’s current offer to employees does not accommodate workers’ needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC is wanting to give us a lump sum of money in exchange for job security, in exchange for outsourcing jobs,” Gonzalez said, noting the UC’s lack of attention to what she believes union workers really need: “We need our job to continue. We don’t need a lump sum of money.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another concern voiced through the microphones involved livable wages. Jarrod Coldron, an AFSCME representative, former UCSB student and present-day groundskeeper at the university, said he is fearful that the cost of living in Isla Vista might force him out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really like my job here, but it’s really expensive to live in Isla Vista, and if I don’t have a good contract, I won’t be able to afford to live here as long as I want to,” Coldron said. “I’m just trying to keep this affordable for me.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the only groundskeeper currently residing in I.V., Coldron explained that his coworkers often commute from other areas in the county to work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think I’m the only groundskeeper on campus that lives in l.V. Everybody else is in Lompoc or </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carpentaria. A lot of people live far away and bus in,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, according to UCOP representative Claire Doan, the UC finds that UPTE is asking too much from the institution and has been unreasonable with their demands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are disappointed with UPTE leadership, demanding unreasonable double-digit raises (16 to 22 percent over the proposed terms of the agreement) that are far beyond those given to other UC employees. Since negotiations began in 2017, our offers have been fair and substantial, guaranteeing competitive wage increases and excellent benefits,” Doan said in an email with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Meanwhile, UPTE leaders have neither presented a realistic counteroffer, nor have they let their members vote on UC’s proposals.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez said she believes the UC’s resistance to forming a better contract is derived from a poor understanding of the situation. At a university, Gonzalez said that a vital function of the workplace is “to make sure that they are respectful of their members,” which includes students at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC doesn’t seem to realize how important we are. We are the first contact when a student comes to the Health Center, when they’re having someone clean their dorms … They don’t go to the offices to see people. They don’t know who they are, they know who we are, and they know that we care,” Gonzalez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gary Colmenar, a librarian at UCSB, offered a similar sentiment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s really important for us to tell the administration that we’re the people who actually work and run the university,” Colmenar said, who also noted a dry spell in contracts for the library’s worker union, University of California American Federation of Teachers (UC-AFT), which has dragged on for over six months.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86998\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-21/in-photos-afscme-utpe-strike/labor-strike_devin-ralston_online-7/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-86998\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86998\" data-attachment-id=\"86998\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-21/in-photos-afscme-utpe-strike/labor-strike_devin-ralston_online-7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Labor Strike_Devin Ralston_ONLINE (7)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86998\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-86998\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Devin Ralston / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the day, waves of union employees marched through campus with chants, aiming to not only build energy, but also to voice their complaints.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At noon, multiple speakers spoke at a rally for the workers, all of whom funneled the sentiments of those chants into the messages of their speeches.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Oscar Soto, a graduate student at UCSB, took the stage, he turned the microphone to the crowd and began to ask them questions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the question: “How many of you are undergrads?” many students raised their hands. A substantial, but fewer, number of palms raised in the air when Soto asked how many </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">workers were graduate students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But zero hands broke the plane when he asked if anyone was a professor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What does this tell you about the university?” Soto asked in response to his own questions. “What does it tell you about the importance of what they [UC] put in front of the table?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez finds that the lack of support from upper-level employees at the UC, such as professors and administrators, has led to a revolving door of frustration for many campus employees. As a result, workers such as Gonzalez say they can feel trapped in a web of negotiations, oftentimes going on strike multiple times in an attempt to bargain with the university.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s no empathy, no feelings. It just seems like all of the UC Regents have all their retirement cut out, they have their pensions, they have their raises, and they do a lot of work, but they have to realize that we’re valuable,” Gonzalez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re family, we’re family with students, and they don’t have that connection like we do, and if they did, they’d really appreciate helping down the line.”</span></p>\n<p>Further photos of the strike can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-21/in-photos-afscme-utpe-strike/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [March 23, 2:31 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

\r\n</script> \n<p>The Angels and Blue Jays spent a lot of money in the offseason and are struggling mightily. The Angels are 11-20, and we have learned that the days of small ball and a great bullpen are long forgotten. They have stolen only 12 bases so far and have a 9:1 strikeout to home run ratio. Josh Hamilton is hitting .208 with two home runs. Then there are their pitching woes. The Angels are second to last in the league in team ERA (4.78) and sixth to last in batting average against (.265). The takeaway: Manager Mike Scioscia is in the hot seat.</p>\n<p>Before the season, many experts had the Blue Jays winning the AL East because they acquired R.A. Dickey, Jose Reyes, Josh Johnson, Mark Buehrle and Melky Cabrera. Now, Toronto is 11-21 with Reyes and Johnson hurt and Cabrera, Buehrle and Dickey all struggling. The takeaway: Don’t sign players who were suspended for steroids a season ago or trade for 38-year-old knuckleballers and injury-plagued starting pitchers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>League Wide Strikeouts</p>\n<p>The league-wide strikeout rates are entering unprecedented territory. This past April featured the second-highest strikeout per game total for a single month in MLB history at 15.29 hitters per game. It wasn’t just April either, the top eight highest strikeout per game totals for a month have come in the last eight months of play. That’s right — the last eight months of play are the top eight months for strikeout per game totals in MLB history. The month that holds the top spot is September 2012, when an average of 15.47 hitters struck out per game.</p>\n<p>Many hitters will point to April’s cold, bad-for-hitting weather in many cities or the pitchers arm’s being fresher, but when this trend dates back to last season it is pretty safe to say that this is an on-going trend. So what is causing this? Twins catcher Joe Mauer has said recently that pitchers are developing deeper pitch repertoires since he came into the league ten years ago. It could also be that since the ousting of performance-enhancing drugs, hitters now have to try a lot harder to hit home runs leading to more whiffs and thus more strikeouts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Yu Darvish Can Pitch</p>\n<p>This isn’t shocking news ­— ­­­­­­­­­­­we all already knew Darvish could pitch. However, what we didn’t know heading into the season is that Darvish has a chance to make history. After barely missing a no-hitter on April 2 against the Astros, Darvish is 5-1 with a 2.56 ERA, and opponents are hitting an abysmal .169 off of him. Here is the historic part: In his 45.2 innings pitched so far this season, he has accumulated 72 strikeouts. That’s about 14 strikeouts for every nine innings pitched, which means he is on pace to become the first pitcher since Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling in 2002 to strikeout 300 batters in a season. If he keeps this up, Darvish could make history by becoming the first Japanese born pitcher to win the Cy Young.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2013 is a new year for 2012 Cy Young Winners David Price and R.A. Dickey</p>\n<p>20-5, 2.56 ERA, 205 K’s — 20-6, 2.73 ERA, 230 K’s</p>\n<p>The numbers above reflect the final regular season stats of last season’s Cy Young award winners, David Price and R.A. Dickey respectively. Now, unfortunately, both of these quality pitchers are finding out that 2012 is no more. So far this season Price is 1-3 with a 6.25 ERA and 40 K’s in 44.2 innings. Dickey is 2-5 with a 5.36 ERA and only 33 K’s in 42 innings.</p>\n<p>These struggles will almost certainly end for Price because he has proven he can be consistently dominant in the competitive AL East. Furthermore, a guy who throws upper 90s with a plus slider and good command will not continue to get lit up like he has. As for Dickey, these struggles shouldn’t be that surprising. He is 38 years old and has won more than 10 games in a season only once before last year. Perhaps the injuries are causing the knuckleball not to knuckle, but his poor numbers could also be a result of moving out of the poor NL East and into the AL East. Now Dickey has to face the big hitting Red Sox, Yankees and Orioles multiple times a year instead of teams like the Marlins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The MLB is becoming a young man’s league</p>\n<p>We are seeing a dramatic drop-off in the number of players who are still productive into their late 30s. Gone are the days where guys like Barry Bonds were hitting 40 home runs annually in late 30s. Now the game is being dominated by young and freakishly athletic players like Mike Trout, Bryce Harper, Stephen Strasburg and Clayton Kershaw.</p>\n<p>What has caused this trend? We don’t know. It could be the passing of the steroid era, which made players better for longer, or simply the manifestation of human evolution right before our eyes. What we do know is that players like Albert Pujols, Josh Hamilton, Alex Rodriguez, Roy Halladay and many other aging stars are not doing well at all. Instead, the players who are making headlines are barely out of their teenage years. In honor of this trend, here are the top 10 players who are 25 years old or younger and who are not named Trout, Harper, Kershaw or Strasburg.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Manny Machado, age: 20, 5 HRs, 21 RBIs, .309 BA. First in league among third basemen with .8 defensive wins above replacement, which measures production compared to the average player. Machado is being compared to Orioles Hall of Fame third basemen Brooks Robinson, who won a record sixteen consecutive gold gloves.</p>\n<p>Anthony Rizzo, age: 23, 8 HRs, 21 RBIs, .246 BA. Despite the low batting average, Rizzo still maintains a solid .331 on-base percentage, which speaks to his eye at the plate.</p>\n<p>Jose Fernandez, age: 20, 1-2, 3.48 ERA, 1.06 WHIP, 32 K’s. Fernandez is the fourth pitcher in the last 90 seasons under the age of 21 to throw seven or more scoreless innings with at least nine strikeouts and allow one hit or fewer.</p>\n<p>Elvis Andrus, age: 24, .246 BA, 10 RBIs, 6 stolen bases. Andrus’s superb defense and 129 career stolen bases are among the many reasons why the Rangers locked him up with an eight year, $120 million contract extension.</p>\n<p>Matt Moore, age: 23, 5-1, 1.95 ERA, 1.05 WHIP, 41 Ks. Moore has allowed only 20 hits in 37 innings pitched so far this season, which means … hope for a walk.</p>\n<p>Jose Altuve, age: 23, .331 BA, 15 RBIs, 1 HR. The only thing more impressive than Altuve’s batting average is that he is doing it at 5’5”, 173 pounds. The epitome of a baseball player.</p>\n<p>Jean Segura, age: 23, .333 BA, 4 HRs, 13 RBIs, 8 stolen bases. After coming over from the Angels in the Greinke trade last season, all Segura has done is hit, hit and hit some more.</p>\n<p>Will Middlebrooks, age: 24, .195 BA, 6 HRs, 12 RBIs. Don’t let his early season slump fool you; Middlebrooks was keeping up with Mike Trout last year before falling to injury. Middlebrooks will be a 30 home run guy for a long time in Boston.</p>\n<p>Chris Sale, age: 24, 3-2, 3.42 ERA, 1.10 WHIP, 42 K’s. Sale has a power arm from the left side and a good feel for all of his pitches. He was in the running for AL Cy Young last year after posting a 17-8 record.</p>\n<p>Matt Harvey, age: 24, 4-0, 1.56 ERA, .82 WHIP, 46 K’s. Harvey’s hard fastball, along with the fact that opponents are hitting .153 against him, has people comparing him to Mets Hall of Famer Tom Seaver.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1812361325\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51214\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51215\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-07/youth-are-taking-over-the-mlb-this-season/machado/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?fit=900%2C900&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"900,900\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Machado\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51215\" alt=\"Machado\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Machado.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 7, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

However, Game One was in Golden State’s control. Late mistakes and a failure to close out the contest allowed the veteran San Antonio squad to take the early series advantage, but the underdog Warriors absolutely proved it should be a very close series.</p>\n<p>The Warriors may have five players averaging more than 12 points in the playoffs, but there is only one name that really matters for the Warriors and that is Stephen Curry. The young player has become one of the great point guards in the league and didn’t disappoint in Game One against the Spurs, totaling 44 points on 18-35 shooting, including six three-pointers and 11 assists in nearly 58 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Easily the MVP of the playoffs so far, Curry can do it all offensively. Get up in his face and he’ll drive by you and make an easy layup, or even a difficult circus shot in the lane if there’s help. Sag off of him to stop the drive and he’ll drain the three-point shot. This season, with his quick release, Curry overtook Ray Allen for most three-pointers in a season in NBA history.</p>\n<p>Not to mention he’s a point guard, so he has no problem sharing the ball and racking up his assist numbers. He averages 9.6 assists in the playoffs, the best in the NBA. In fact, in the Denver series, Curry became the only player in NBA history with at least seven assists and four three-pointers in four straight playoff games. And he did it in the first four playoff games of his career.</p>\n<p>Curry also ranks third in player efficiency rating, behind only Kevin Durant and LeBron James. Those are big names to be grouped with for a man that was left off the All-Star team this season. Curry has something to prove, and overcoming the Spurs and winning a second-round playoff series for the first time since the 1974-75 season would be the perfect way to do it.</p>\n<p>This season, the Warriors and Spurs split their series 2-2, with each team winning on its own home court. Yet while the Spurs finished in second in the Western Conference, the Warriors finished sixth, and still have a lot of room for improvement, especially in the turnover department. If this young, athletic Golden State team can draw out the series, the more of an advantage it has as it may be able to tire out a veteran team.</p>\n<p>Plus, Golden State has possibly the best home court advantage, with a crowd and city that has gone crazy for its team given its lack of success in the last few decades. If the Warriors can steal one on the road, which they proved in Game One that they have the potential to, the home court advantage could push the series in their favor.</p>\n<p>Finally, both teams have proven they love to play the up-tempo style, wanting to put lots of points on the board. Golden State leads the league in points per game during the playoffs at 110.0, although San Antonio is close behind at 109.0. In the end, this style should benefit the Warriors because if you’re going to run, young, athletic teams will usually win the race.</p>\n<p>Either way, if Monday’s game is any indication, it’s going to be a very entertaining series.</p>\n<p>Prediction: Warriors in seven</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 8th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Anna Xu of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51234\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/the-young-warriors-versus-the-veteran-spurs-stephan-curry-takes-golden-state-to-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51234\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/the-young-warriors-versus-the-veteran-spurs-stephan-curry-takes-golden-state-to-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/the-young-warriors-versus-the-veteran-spurs-stephan-curry-takes-golden-state-to-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/the-young-warriors-versus-the-veteran-spurs-stephan-curry-takes-golden-state-to-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/the-young-warriors-versus-the-veteran-spurs-stephan-curry-takes-golden-state-to-victory/","id":2104,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[2103,2102,2101],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
