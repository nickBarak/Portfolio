She said “this country is powered by the engine of amnesia” because historical aspects are often “conveniently” left out in conversation about BLM.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza went on to say that the nation has a history of racially prejudiced “laws, policies and practices,” which she said are “deliberately designed to rob some of power in favor of giving others power.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She noted that of the “two million people locked up … one million of those people” are African American. She said they are not incarcerated because they are “inherently criminal.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is not liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican; this is just what is,” she said. “It’s because there are laws that disproportionately target black people for things that all people do, but not all people get put in cages for their lives.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This July will mark the four-year anniversary of BLM, and Garza said she wanted to make it clear that it is not just a movement for black lives, “but a movement to save all of our lives.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said there are misunderstandings of the movement that distract from its message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Black Lives Matter started as a love note to black people, but it is a demand and a call to action,” Garza said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77388\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77388\" data-attachment-id=\"77388\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-02/black-lives-matter-co-founder-debunks-blm-myths-at-campbell-hall/alicia-garza-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"768,512\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Alicia Garza-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-77388\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77388\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said this movement began in generations prior to hers and is now a continuation of a long legacy of struggle in the United States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza also outlined three “myths” of BLM: the notions that it is anti-police, anti-white and black supremacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said the movement is not anti-police, but, rather, it is against the perpetuation of cycles of violence. She said she believes the cycle will end when someone is courageous enough to say that the institutions and systems in place “are not working.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza also said the allegation that BLM is a black supremacy group “just doesn’t make sense.” The activist group does not want to perpetuate the same systems that oppress people but, rather, to transform the powers that operate those systems, Garza said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christine Dolan, associate director at the Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity and one of the organizers for the event, said BLM week is about “coalition building.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dolan said they believe the event was an effective way to bring people together and “center the Black Lives Matter movement on campus.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fabiola Pérez, a fourth-year biological anthropology major, said she thought Garza made “all these issues human” and spoke about them in realistic terms.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like a lot of the stuff we see is so out there and it feels so far away, when in reality it’s very immediate and very close,” Pérez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said she wanted the audience to leave thinking about “the ways we want to create movement and the ways we establish power.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the U.S. needs “really courageous white people” to realize white supremacy does exist, adding that economic struggles are national concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “White folks need this movement,” she said. “They’re being fed a lie, too.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The week’s events aim to address the nature of institutionalized racism and its effect on society.</p>\n<p>Garza, current special projects director for the National Domestic Workers Alliance, will share her call-to-action against discrimination in the U.S. and urge individuals to join the fight for justice for all black lives.</p>\n<p>Garza will also be featured in a sustainability workshop at 12 p.m. Wednesday in the Associated Students (A.S.) Pardall Center to discuss student activism, strategizing and movement.</p>\n<p>The BLM movement started in 2012 after 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was posthumously put on trial for his own murder and the shooter, George Zimmerman, was acquitted of the murder charges.</p>\n<p>Martin’s death and Zimmerman’s acquisition sparked outrage across the country. Racial tension became the center of protests much like those in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 after Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed by then police officer Darren Wilson.</p>\n<p>These cases prompted grassroots community organizing like BLM in response to the rising number of police shootings across the country.</p>\n<p>The internet responded to the growing tensions with #BlackLivesMatter.</p>\n<p>Opal Tometi, Patrisse Cullors and Garza, the BLM founders, transformed the viral hashtag into a movement that is now a chapter-based national organization working for the validity of black life.</p>\n<p>According to their website, BLM strives to broaden the conversation around state violence to include all of the ways in which black people are intentionally left powerless at the hands of the state.</p>\n<p>“It was a response to the anti-Black racism that permeates our society and also, unfortunately, our movements,” wrote Garza in the “herstory” section of their website.</p>\n<p>Critics of the movement visited UCSB earlier this year and stirred controversy over free speech.</p>\n<p>Ben Shapiro, conservative political commentator and author, visited Campbell Hall in February for an event titled “The Regressive Left, ‘Social Justice’ and #BlackLivesMatter.” The lecture was previously entitled “Lies, Prejudice and Division: The Legacy of the #BLM Movement.”</p>\n<p>The event was preempted by a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-s-senate-approves-funding-for-ben-shapiro-event-after-six-hour-meeting/\">six-hour-long A.S.

He said UCSB is “way ahead” of other campuses in fighting student food insecurities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones said that, aside from the food bank team, Hechler has “really pushed things forward to have things settled and made sure that the expansion happened.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also said the whole food bank team got together to fight for the expansion, and she hopes to see it completed before she graduates in June.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hopefully with the work that we’re doing, we can destigmatize the desire and need to get food aid when you need it,” Jones said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76597\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-01/a-s-food-bank-begins-facility-expansion-renovation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76597\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-01/a-s-food-bank-begins-facility-expansion-renovation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-01/a-s-food-bank-begins-facility-expansion-renovation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-01/a-s-food-bank-begins-facility-expansion-renovation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-01/a-s-food-bank-begins-facility-expansion-renovation/","id":2394,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2393,2392,2391],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SJP Proposes Bill to Divest from Alleged Palestinian Human Rights Abuses","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-04-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-27-at-12.37.21-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-27-at-12.37.21-PM.png?resize=770%2C548&ssl=1","description":"The student group UC Santa Barbara Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) released a resolution this Sunday calling for Associated Students to divest from companies that contribute to what SJP calls ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The student group UC Santa Barbara Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) released a resolution this Sunday calling for Associated Students to divest from companies that contribute to what SJP calls an occupation of Palestine.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The resolution calls for the university to examine and promptly disinvest from its assets that provide support for “occupying” Palestinian territories, building a wall in a highly disputed area, the West Bank, or developing Israeli settlements on “annexed” territories.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">SJP called for A.S., UCSB and the Regents to divest from Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Caterpillar and Hewlett Packard in particular, though it said these are not the only companies contributing to Palestinian oppression, and the UC should divest from any of its assets profiting from such actions.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The resolution was released on the night of Holocaust Remembrance Day in Israel. Critics believed the resolution’s timing was purposefully malicious. SJP released a statement on their Facebook page denouncing the implication that the post was anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The proposal was endorsed by 25 other student organizations including the A.S. Student Commission on Racial Equality, El Congreso and the Student Activist Network.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Anumita Kaur, SJP member and fourth-year sociology major, sponsored the resolution, which she said SJP plans to place on the A.S. Senate agenda next week.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kaur said the student organization had two goals in creating the resolution, the first being the “tangible ask” of demanding UCSB and the UC system to remove funds from corporations that allegedly assist in violence against the Palestinian people.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kaur said the resolution was also meant to be a way for the UC system to be held accountable and to focus on making ethical investments at all times.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kaur said the organization’s second goal was to educate people.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“A lot of people can’t even point to where Palestine is on the map, and it’s so important that people understand that this is a violence occurring on our globe,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In an accompanying press release made public on Sunday, SJP said its resolution “is in no way intended to alienate students on campus; it is intended to create a critical dialogue about regimes participating in human rights violations.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The statement added that students were critical to social movements in the past and that UCSB must answer its duty as a top-level institution.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Students have historically been at the forefront of social justice movements, from the Civil Rights Movement to South African Apartheid, student power has been an integral part of progress and change,” the statement read.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Belonging to a top tier research institution, it is our duty to combat racism, patriarchy, homophobia, transphobia, imperialism, colonization and global inequality. We cannot exceptionalize Israel.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Sunday’s resolution and press release are part of a years-long student effort to call for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), a “nonviolent movement that was called for by Palestinian Civil Society in 2005 in response to Israel’s disregard for international law,” as the statement describes it.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kaur said she believes if people were more understanding of SJP’s perspective, they might have less “volatile opinions.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I think the biggest thing to understand about this movement and this resolution is that it’s really just premised on love; it’s premised on, you know, a desire for global humanity,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“All it is in its inherent nature is asking the university to remove funds from American corporations that assist in violence against a people.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77403\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/26-student-groups-support-bds-resolution/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77403\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/26-student-groups-support-bds-resolution/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/26-student-groups-support-bds-resolution/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/26-student-groups-support-bds-resolution/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/26-student-groups-support-bds-resolution/","id":2392,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2391,2390,2389],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
