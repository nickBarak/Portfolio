Lipsitz, as the host, asked questions while Patterson and Kim answered. The room was packed with students and visitors alike.</p>\n<p>“Love-driven politics” was Kim’s main theme. He talked about the resilience of love in the face of hate and power struggles in the political scene. Using his own upbringing as an example, he started off with a word of gratitude toward the organizers of the event. He said he hoped the same sincere gratitude would be present in the political sphere.</p>\n<p>Kim also talked about the culture of hate as perpetrated by the Trump campaign and the effects of such hate, including political gridlock in Washington D.C.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, most of Paterson’s themes focused on her phrase “Freedom is now!” Using her cultural background for context, Patterson explored the history of African Americans.</p>\n<p>She recounted her visit to Ghana in the early 2000s, where she was told of the plight of early African slaves who were stowed on ships “packed like sardines” with only the ability “to move your head or a foot.”</p>\n<p>Another anecdote she shared was her own experience with pain, loss and lack of freedom during Hurricane Katrina. As a New Orleans native, she endured the storm personally, and it was the inspiration for much of her poetry. The idea behind the phrase “Freedom is now!” she said, is that one has to seize the moment.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, October 6, 2016 print edition of

2016 – 2017 year. <em>Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Associated Students Senators began their time in office at the first Senate of the year on Wednesday after a delayed start for the new government in spring 2016.</p>\n<p>The last three of 25 Associated Students (A.S.) senators were sworn into office Wednesday, finalizing the approval of the A.S. Senate for the 2016-2017 academic year.</p>\n<p>Typically, new Senators sit in for their first meeting at the end of Spring Quarter, but such action was delayed by bribery allegations against the Interfraternity Council (IFC) in the 2016 spring election.</p>\n<p>After A.S. Elections Board called for a revote, accusing the IFC of bribing its members to vote for specific candidates, the UCSB Audit and Advisory Department launched an investigation into the allegations. Then-A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal formed the Villarreal Elections Commission to process the Audit and Advisory Department’s findings while Senate was out-of-session in the summer.</p>\n<p>The investigation came to a close in May, finding no evidence of wrongdoing by the IFC. Twenty-two of the 25 newly elected senators were then sworn-in throughout the summer.</p>\n<p>Unable to be sworn in with the rest of the Senate during summer, Unique Vance, Sabrina Divin and Aaron Hendizadeh made their pledges and officially took on their elected positions last night instead.</p>\n<p>With all its members finally approved, A.S. Senate ratified the decision of the Villarreal Elections Commission, which approved the findings of the Audit and Advisory Department’s investigation in May. Seventeen senators approved this motion, seven abstained from voting and one senator remains absent while studying abroad in Great Britain for the Fall Quarter.</p>\n<p>Senate also unanimously approved a mission statement Wednesday, adding a milestone for the organization. In a draft outlining the measure to create a mission statement, Internal Vice President (IVP) Natalie Jordan said A.S. Senate had no established mission statement prior to Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The approved mission statement names the functions of the A.S. Senate to “represent and advocate for the undergraduate student body” and “strive to effectively address their concerns.” It also enumerates that Senate will “enhance student life” and “improve campus climate” while “remaining conscious” of the UCSB community, the environment and the University of California system.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, September 29, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Previously, the Transfer Center was comprised of one room in the Student Resource Building. <em>Christopher Chen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara held a grand opening for the transfer student center in the UCSB Library on Wednesday, celebrating a work in progress since the library opened doors in January.</p>\n<p>Located on the first floor of the library, the area expands on resources which previously only existed in one room at the Student Resource Center. After a soft opening in April, the location has been successful in drawing students.</p>\n<p>Two full-time academic advisors, several peer mentors and advisors from various campus programs occupy the large gathering space.</p>\n<p>Transfer students are also able to attend regular workshops at the center, geared toward establishing a relationship with undergraduate research.</p>\n<p>Wednesday’s grand opening hosted Chancellor Henry T. Yang, Transfer Student President Cori Saint Marie and Interim Co-Dean of Undergraduate Education Linda Adler-Kassner.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara accepted 16,948 transfer students this year at an acceptance rate of 52 percent. Because of the Transfer Admission Guarantee (T.A.G.) for California community college students, 94 percent of the transfer class is comprised of in-state students.</p>\n<p>The T.A.G. program ensures admission for all in-state community college students who meet an overall 3.2 GPA and additional unit requirements. Transfer students comprised 24 percent of the undergraduate population at UCSB as of 2015.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, September 29, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72694\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/new-transfer-center-opens-in-the-library/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72694\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/new-transfer-center-opens-in-the-library/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/new-transfer-center-opens-in-the-library/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/new-transfer-center-opens-in-the-library/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-29/new-transfer-center-opens-in-the-library/","id":2452,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2451,2450,2449],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
