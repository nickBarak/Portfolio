This was their second win in a row and their fourth in their last five games. Dylan Lewis’ goal in the 13th minute propelled the Gauchos to the win and improved their record to 5-3-3 overall and 1-0 in the Big West. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long Beach State won the Big West regular season and tournament championship last year and they were picked to do it again in 2019, according to the Big West Preseason Coaches Poll. They came into Sunday’s match with a 3-7 overall record and some momentum following a 2-1 win at Cal Poly on Thursday. Sunday’s game was a chance for them to make a statement early on in Big West play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it was UCSB that attacked early, as the team put up four shots in the first 13 minutes, with the final attempt finding the net via the left leg of Dylan Lewis and assisted by Shaelan Murison. The goal was Lewis’ second of the season and second in the last two games as she has been putting herself in good positions to score of late. Murison’s four assists of the season lead the team and pair with her team-leading eight goals in their first eleven games. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was the story of the first half, even though no one else found the net, because the Gauchos managed eight shots which dwarfed the two that Long Beach attempted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 49ers did have a great opportunity to even the score early in the second half, when junior Kaylee Ramirez attempted a penalty kick from inside the goal box in the 53rd minute, only for Gaucho keeper Hanna DeWeese to deflect the shot and send it wide right to protect the Gaucho lead. That shot was one of only two shots on goal that Long Beach managed during the match, and both attempts resulted in saves by DeWeese. Her two saves contributed to the second straight complete game shutout for DeWeese and her fifth in total on the year. DeWeese is currently all over the Big West leaderboard in goalkeeping stats; she is fourth in saves with 35, third in save percentage at .778 and first overall in goals-against average at 0.86 goals allowed per game. If her non-conference play can translate to the Big West portion of the schedule, the team will benefit and DeWeese will surely be an All-Conference player.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB won in part due to their offense’s continued attack of the goal, and their 12 shots and six shots on goal tell the story when compared to LBSU’s six shots and two shots on goal. This is the usual formula that Gaucho wins follow, where they are able to wear down the opposing defenders and goalkeeper until someone can slip a ball or two past the goalie. When UCSB is playing well like this, their offensive attack allows their defense to rest while the ball is on the other end, and they then have more energy to defend their own goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another big storyline for this game is that UCSB was without their usual starters Christine Maurer, Emma Vanderhyden and Lynsee Voss. This forced in a lot of new players into roles they are not entirely familiar with, and the reserves clearly stepped up, especially on the defensive end where the goalie never had to do too much work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, the Gauchos will travel up to UC Davis where they will face the Aggies, a team desperate for their first conference win. The game will take place on Thursday Oct. 10 at 4 p.m. in Davis.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90276\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-08/ucsb-womens-soccer-team-blanks-long-beach-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90276\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-08/ucsb-womens-soccer-team-blanks-long-beach-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-08/ucsb-womens-soccer-team-blanks-long-beach-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-08/ucsb-womens-soccer-team-blanks-long-beach-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-08/ucsb-womens-soccer-team-blanks-long-beach-state/","id":1627,"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone"},"related":[1626,1625,1624],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone","biography":"Not available","articles":[970,979,996,1006,1272,1273,1274,1275,1276,1278,1279,1280,1283,1291,1296,1299,1304,1305,1310,1314,1324,1332,1334,1564,1577,1627,1676,1681,3413,4902,5559,5564,5566,5570,5571,5575,5579],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Ready to Reclaim Big West Crown","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/JakeCollins_MSoccer_100512_302.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/JakeCollins_MSoccer_100512_302.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After missing the postseason for the first time in six seasons after injuries rattled the squad, the UCSB men’s soccer team looks to once again return to its place atop the Big West Conference this ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After missing the postseason for the first time in six seasons after injuries rattled the squad, the UCSB men’s soccer team looks to once again return to its place atop the Big West Conference this season. Picked to finish first in the Big West North Division by the media, the Gauchos enter this season with one goal in mind: Improvement.<br>\n“We have high expectations, but I feel like the expectations are based off of getting the players back who were hurt and the addition of some very, very good young players who I think are going to help us right away,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “I think those two ingredients are going to help us do very well this year.”<br>\nHeadlining the returning Gauchos is senior defensive midfielder Fifi Baiden who garnered All-Big West First Team honors last season. Once again picked by the media as All-Big West in the preseason, Baiden will anchor a defensive backline that will be the strength of the Gauchos this season.<br>\n“Our back line is our strength. We have experience and we’ve played in so many games together,” Baiden said. “It’s actually really good for the team in terms of communicating and helping the new players to settle in with the team. It’s going to be the key for us this year.”<br>\nAlso named as the No. 38 player in the entire country by TopDrawerSoccer.com, Baiden will look to lead the Gauchos this season with his usual defensive oriented play.<br>\n“It’s fun to be recognized and it shows that you’re doing something good,” Baiden said. “My philosophy, personally, I see myself as a team guy. I don’t want to force myself to do anything to hurt the team. Being recognized nationally also gives me the hope that I am not doing a bad job.”<br>\nJoining Baiden on the preseason list for top players nationwide includes senior forward Achille Campion at No. 100. Campion missed much of last year due to injury but will be the focus of the offensive attack this season for Santa Barbara.<br>\n“Our leading goal scorer literally would have been Campion, and of course, he got hurt some games in the season,” Vom Steeg said. “We anticipate him having a real big season for us. [Senior midfielder] Goffin Boyoko is another player who played hurt all last year. He’s another player who will give us goals.”<br>\nWhile defense certainly seems to be the strength for the Gauchos, it will be up to the pair of seniors in Boyoko and Campion, along with a talented group of newcomers to give the offensive attack some new life that was missing last season.<br>\nIncluded in the list of newcomers expected to contribute immediately are junior forward Reed McKenna, a transfer from UCLA, and a pair of freshman in midfielder Paul Ehmann and forward Ismaila Jome.<br>\n“We’re a bigger team (than last season),” Vom Steeg said. “We have a couple of players who can serve the ball very well and I think when you put that mix together, we’re going to be able to get some goals off of set pieces.”<br>\nUCSB plays its first regular season game against No. 19 Northwestern University on Friday in Evanston, Illinois. Kickoff is scheduled for 5 p.m. Pacific Time.</p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Jake Collins of</em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51812\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/ucsb-ready-to-reclaim-big-west-crown/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51812\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/ucsb-ready-to-reclaim-big-west-crown/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/ucsb-ready-to-reclaim-big-west-crown/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/ucsb-ready-to-reclaim-big-west-crown/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/ucsb-ready-to-reclaim-big-west-crown/","id":1626,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1625,1624,1623],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look Strong on the Backline","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CedarLay_WSoccer_8_24_2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CedarLay_WSoccer_8_24_2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A new season with a different attitude brings a new motto: Believe.

That is the saying going around the UCSB women’s soccer team this year and that which the players have embraced as they prepare for the start of the season.<br>\nAn aggressive mentality and gritty play on the field, as well as the new motto, will be the backbone for this UCSB team.<br>\n“I think we have as reasonable a shot as everyone else,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “All the big teams in the Big West are so close that on any given day one person can kind of turn the other over. I think we have just as good of a shot as anyone just as long as we stay healthy.”<br>\nUCSB comes in with the goal of qualifying for the Big West Conference Tournament for the first time since 2009. Last season, Santa Barbara finished in ninth place in the league with only seven points earned in total.<br>\nThis season UCSB was picked to finish sixth in the Big West Conference Coach’s Poll. However, the Gauchos will have to stay healthy and overcome a lack of goal scoring that plagued the team last season. Although four players underwent offseason surgery and will not be ready for the early part of the season, the majority of the team enters in strong shape and focused on avoiding injury.<br>\n“We don’t want to have as many injuries as we did last year,” senior defender Lindsay Gankema said. “We all came in fit, which helped and we’re going to work in the weight room.”<br>\nSanta Barbara managed only 19 goals last season, the fewest in the entire league. Because of an inability to finish on many scoring opportunities, 13 new players were brought in this year with the intention of creating plays on offense and putting the ball on frame.<br>\n“A lot of them have different personalities on the field, meaning they have different styles of play,” junior midfielder Indiana Mead said. “I think they’re really technical, so they bring a new spark on the team we definitely needed.”<br>\nAdded playing time will also give experience to the freshman and add depth to offset potential injury down the stretch. Although the new freshman will try to make an impact early on, team chemistry is still something that the Gauchos have to develop in the first month of their non-conference schedule as they prepare for league play beginning in October.<br>\n“We’re working on [chemistry] because chemistry is important,” Gankema said. “I wouldn’t say it is necessarily hard but it’s going to take a little bit of time.”<br>\nThe blueprint for the Gauchos’ success this season centers primarily on the defensive end of the pitch. Four seniors will play defense for the Gauchos including twin sisters Paige and Lindsay Gankema and center back Taylor Gehring, who returns from injury this season. Four-year starting goalkeeper Makenna Henry, who played injured for a large portion of last season, will command the posts again this year.<br>\n“Defensively we will be very strong …  most of us have been really close on and off the field and we already have that chemistry,” Gankema said. “We all work really well together, we read each other very well and get back for each other and that makes us strong.”<br>\nUCSB plays 11 non-conference matches with its first conference game at home against UC Irvine on Oct 4.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 16 of August 28, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cedar Lay of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-look-strong-on-the-backline/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-look-strong-on-the-backline/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-look-strong-on-the-backline/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-look-strong-on-the-backline/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-look-strong-on-the-backline/","id":1624,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1623,1622,1621],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB to Play First Big West Home Games","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"This weekend holds a couple of firsts for the No. 4 UCSB men’s soccer team.

The perfect start is the best since 2004 when the Gauchos went 12 games without a loss.</p>\n<p>“We’re happy to be undefeated, but we have two big games at home and we need two wins,” junior midfielder Fifi Baiden said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB will also be defending a near-perfect home record of 3-0-1. With six of its next seven games at home, the Gauchos should take advantage of playing at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>“It’s always fun to play on your home soil,” Baiden said. “You get the fans behind you. Whatever you have to do to get a win, you do.”</p>\n<p>In tonight’s matchup against rival UC Irvine, Santa Barbara will once again be looking for redemption. The Anteaters won both matches last season and are back-to-back Big West Champions, stealing the title from the Gauchos both times.</p>\n<p>Yet this year the Anteaters are struggling. The team holds a 3-7-1 overall record and is currently 0-2 in conference. Having lost five straight games, the Anteaters are hungry for a win, desperately needing to gain some type of momentum. “They’re a team that I think is fighting for their season on Friday night,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “They’ve lost two league games and they’re hoping in one game they can turn things around. For them, that has to happen on Friday night.”</p>\n<p>This week, the focus has returned to the offense for the Gauchos. While UCSB was shut out for the fifth time this season last weekend against Cal State Fullerton, Santa Barbara has plenty of offensive weapons.</p>\n<p>Senior midfielder Nic Ryan ranks second in the Big West in game-winning goals with three and junior forward Dom Sarle is tied for second in conference in assists with four.</p>\n<p>“The key [against Irvine] is our offense,” Baiden said. “This week’s practice was about getting chances in the final third and being aggressive. We also have to play to our playmakers.”</p>\n<p>On Sunday, UCSB will see one of the tougher teams in conference. Northridge begins the weekend at 7-4 overall and ranks third in the Big West with a 1-1 conference record.</p>\n<p>Like the Gauchos, the Matadors are an offensive-minded team. Northridge puts up the most shots in the Big West with nearly 19 per game. They also average 2.18 goals per game, just slightly behind UCSB, which scores 2.3 goals per game.</p>\n<p>“The key to their success has been their ability to score goals,” Vom Steeg said. “They have at least two players that if you give them an open shot, they can hit the ball very well and they’re comfortable around the net.”</p>\n<p>In fact, Northridge currently holds two of the best scorers in the Big West. Sophomore forward Sagi Lev-Ari leads the Big West in goals with nine and sophomore forward Edwin Rivas is tied for second in points with six goals and one assist.</p>\n<p>“If those players get isolated or are left open, then they can hurt you,” Vom Steeg said. “Defensively, our emphasis will be on knowing where they are and [making sure] they’re picked up so that they have to work hard to get the ball and create opportunities.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff against UC Irvine is set for 7 p.m. tonight. Sunday’s game against Northridge is scheduled for 5 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47968\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-05/ucsb-play-big-west-home-games/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47968\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-05/ucsb-play-big-west-home-games/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-05/ucsb-play-big-west-home-games/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-05/ucsb-play-big-west-home-games/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-05/ucsb-play-big-west-home-games/","id":1625,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1624,1623,1622],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
