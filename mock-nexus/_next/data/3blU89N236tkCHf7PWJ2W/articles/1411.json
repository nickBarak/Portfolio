I went up and I hit as hard as I could and landed on one leg. My knee collapsed and I fell,” Barbeau said. “I remember thinking I broke my leg.

This also meant that she would be unable to play her senior club season and possibly her freshman year at UCSB.</p>\n<p>After a faster-than-expected recovery time, Barbeau was back on the court in six months to make her first appearance for the Gauchos. However, the journey did not end there. The road to recovery was admittedly frustrating for Barbeau and challenged her mentally, but she claims that she never considered giving up.</p>\n<p>“I had a rough time coming back my freshman year from my ACL tear. (Former Head Coach) Kathy Gregory expected me to come in and be a starter, and I did too,” Barbeau said. “When that didn’t happen it was really disappointing, and by the end of my freshman season I was pretty frustrated. But during my sophomore season, [Nicole Lantagne Welch] came in and kind of re-lit the hope that I would be a starter.”</p>\n<p>Despite limited playing time, she gained confidence as she appeared in 23 matches in her first season, recording 69 kills and 36 digs.</p>\n<p>“When I first came back, I was really slow physically and I couldn’t jump very high, so, I struggled especially on defense,” Barbeau said. “There was always the fear that I would tear it again, and on similar plays to when I tore it, I was scared to really go for it.”</p>\n<p>Barbeau also suffered a broken finger in her sophomore year, as she recalls that her pinky went crooked after she deflected a kill with her hand in a moment that almost caused her to pass out.</p>\n<p>An inspiration to those on her team, her teammate sophomore outside hitter Ali Spindt describes Barbeau to be “a leader on and off the court, and someone who we have come to turn to when we need a kill and a key player.”</p>\n<p>During her time at UCSB, Barbeau splits her time as an athlete and as a student, studying biopsychology. In addition to her stellar performances this season, Barbeau played every match for the Gauchos in 2013 and recorded double-digit kills fourteen times on her way to being named to the All-Big West First Team.</p>\n<p>“[Barbeau] is a reliant captain that’s always working hard on and off the court,” junior libero Shauna Klein said. “She’s confident and wants the ball at all times during the match. She’s made a huge impact on our team this season.”</p>\n<p>Watch Barbeau and the Gauchos take on Hawaii on Nov. 21 at the Thunderdome after her team returns from a two-game road-trip this weekend against Cal State Northridge and Long Beach State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of November 13, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Hornets clinched second place in the North as UC Davis lost to Cal Poly 2-1 in OT on Wednesday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We’re just really happy to finally get our first trophy,” Selemani said. “It’s very rewarding because we put in a lot of work this year but we’re just happy.”</p>\n<p>At halftime, both sides seemed comfortable with the 0-0 scoreline. With zero shots on goal recorded in the first period, the second half marked the Hornets attempt to come out playing like a team that had to win to keep their division title hopes alive.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos broke the deadlock, though, when sophomore defender Jan Ilskens recorded the first point of his collegiate career when he found Selemani at the top of the box, who drilled his left-footed shot into the top right corner for the winger’s fourth game winner of the season.</p>\n<p>After the visitors took the lead, Sac State turned it up a notch, creating several great chances in the final 10 minutes. However, it was unable to find the equalizer in the end, thanks to a solid team performance by the UCSB defense.</p>\n<p>Playing without starting junior fullback Randy Mendoza (yellow cards) and freshman midfielder Daniel Amo, who once again aggravated his groin injury against Cal Poly, it seemed plausible that the Gauchos would be at a disadvantage. However, freshmen Lamar Batista and Kyle Perno filled in the gaps with aplomb on the offensive end in a season-defining match.</p>\n<p>“That was a huge challenge of ours, and in the early season we had a hard time finishing games and unfortunately dropped a lot of points,” Selemani said. “Mentally, we locked in. We’re a lot more focused now, and you can tell that everyone’s aware when the clock is ticking in the dying moments, so I think we’re doing a better job now.”</p>\n<p>Le Roux made sure the Gauchos held onto their one-goal lead in the final minutes with a few clearances and saves to improve his scoreless run in goal to a season-long 285:22 minutes. The true freshman from Paris has been a revelation in his debut season, leading the NCAA with 1698:12 minutes, and the goalkeeper hasn’t missed a single second of game time.</p>\n<p>Selemani’s strike in the 81st was his seventh of the season, placing him second on the team and third in the conference. Since the start of Big West play, the Ann Arbor native has the most goals in Big West play with five in the last nine matches. The Gaucho attack has been well balanced all year with three players in the top five of Big West goal scorers with junior midfielder Kevin Feucht atop the charts with 10 goals and senior striker Nick DePuy tied for fifth with six.</p>\n<p>“It’s been exciting taking on a new role, and it all comes from practicing in the offseason, taking shot after shot, so finally getting results has been good,” Selemani said. “We’ve been playing well together, and everyone is finding one another, and we’ve found a way to get the offense going.”</p>\n<p>DePuy’s 15 goals last season — the top in the nation during the regular season — made up just over 35 percent of the team’s goals. However, this year, that figure has dropped to around 20 percent thanks to the telling contributions from elsewhere in the attack.</p>\n<p>As DePuy’s unlucky recent goal drought continues with the forward having just one goal in the team’s last eight matches, Feucht, Selemani and company have picked up the slack as the Gauchos’ unbeaten streak in conference is one game away from ending in an undefeated Big West season.</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB is the last home game of the season Sunday against UC Davis. The match will be played at Harder Stadium at 2 p.m., the team’s last game before beginning its postseason run with a Big West semifinal on Nov. 9.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73573\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-28/ucsb-clinches-big-west-north-with-1-0-win-at-sac-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73573\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-28/ucsb-clinches-big-west-north-with-1-0-win-at-sac-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-28/ucsb-clinches-big-west-north-with-1-0-win-at-sac-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-28/ucsb-clinches-big-west-north-with-1-0-win-at-sac-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-28/ucsb-clinches-big-west-north-with-1-0-win-at-sac-state/","id":1408,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1407,1406,1405],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos in Vulnerable State, Hopeful in Final Two Matches of Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2016-10-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-29-at-11.22.11-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-29-at-11.22.11-AM.png?resize=883%2C456&ssl=1","description":"After experiencing back-to-back defeats for the first time this season, UCSB is ready to turn it around in the final week of Big West regular season play.

In order to continue that success, the Gauchos will need to rely on the backbone of their team: their defense.</p>\n<p>While the numbers prove that UCSB has been more than capable of scoring goals, being able to hold other teams to a limited amount of scoring opportunities is just as important when it comes to the team’s game plan.</p>\n<p>“Keeping opposing teams to zero or one goal takes a lot of pressure off of our attackers,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “Now, to win a game, we might only need one or two goals of our own. Our team defending has been a significant part of our success this year.”</p>\n<p>Gaucho starting sophomore goalkeeper Brittney Rogers has been a huge asset to her team this year. Collecting 38 saves and six shutouts, she has played a valuable and effective role in the team’s defense. Without her achievements this year in protecting the net, the Gauchos would not likely hold the successful winning record they currently possess.</p>\n<p>Similarly, junior forward Amanda Ball has made major contributions this season, having scored a Big-West-leading 10 goals. Sophomore forward Mallory Hromatko and freshman midfielder Shaelan Murison are also key offensive players with four goals each.</p>\n<p>Leading UCSB’s charge in setting up these attackers with scores has been sophomore midfielder Maddie Gibson, who leads the team with five assists.</p>\n<p>Senior midfielder Ashley Dean, senior defender Savannah Francis, senior midfielder Dakota Griggs and sophomore midfielder Sydney Magnin have also contributed on the assisting end with three apiece.</p>\n<p>The UC Davis Aggies currently sit with the Gauchos in fourth place in the standings; however, UCSB leads them in multiple offensive categories. In the key category of goals scored, the Gauchos have tallied 28 this season to the Aggies’ 21. Another key category is corner kicks where Davis has earned 83 while the Gauchos have put together 111.</p>\n<p>However, as with every game, it will be important for UCSB to go into this match treating the Aggies as a tough competitor capable of defeating any team.</p>\n<p>“It would be a mistake by our players to think we can just show up and win. [UC Davis] are going to be tough no matter what their record is,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>With that being said, there are a number of impact players on the UC Davis roster that cannot be overlooked.</p>\n<p>In the front of the field, the veteran duo of senior forwards Celina Minissian and Rachel Ahr has led UC Davis on offense as both have currently scored four goals each. Also contributing are sophomore forward Crystal Crump and freshman forward Nicole Carson, as both lead the team with three assists each.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Alexis Smith has been the permanent goalkeeper for the Aggies as she has played every game from start to finish, collecting a total of 65 saves and five shutouts.</p>\n<p>Long Beach State will make for a more challenging opponent as it sits one place above the Gauchos in the Big West standings.

The Titans will hope to secure their third straight conference title.</p>\n<p>After a slow start to the match, CSUF started to grab a hold of the tempo and was quickly rewarded for its early energy when freshman forward Rei Dorwart’s sweetly struck effort found the top-right corner to give the visitors a 1-0 lead in the match’s ninth minute.</p>\n<p>The Titans maintained control throughout the majority of the first half, limiting the Gauchos’ potent attack to just three shots. The top seeded Gauchos entered the half down 1-0, struggling to create anything up front.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t get to enough balls first tonight,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Like everything else, we’ve got a long offseason to look at that. We discussed this all year, and this is the first UCSB team in some time that had no wide play on either side.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton struck almost immediately at the start of the second half when a poor UCSB clearance bounced to Fullerton’s sophomore midfielder Ross McPhie.</p>\n<p>McPhie capitalized on the possession when his low shot rolled to the right of UCSB goalkeeper Brandon Berke for the score to double Fullerton’s lead to 2-0. The second goal forced the Gauchos to pick up the pace for the last 43 minutes, but the Titans’ conference-best defense was up to the test.</p>\n<p>After several scoring opportunities and corner kicks, UCSB reached the back of the net in the 64th minute when freshman winger Noah Billingsley beat his man down the flank before firing in a hard low ball across the face of the goal post, in which Feucht was there to pounce on the chance.</p>\n<p>For the next 15 minutes, the Gauchos controlled the pace of play and looked likely to score, but were unable to find the equalizer.</p>\n<p>Senior midfielder Josue España, who had been playing with a slight knee injury since the first Cal Poly game, looked to be reinjured after a hard challenge on the counter.</p>\n<p>Although he returned for five minutes, the team’s assist leader garnering seven assists had to come out early in the last game of his impressive two-year stay at Harder. Playing through injury, the senior managed to bring the home crowd to its feet on several occasions with his flicks and tricks before his exit.</p>\n<p>España and Billingsley looked the most likely to create the game-tying chance, and the latter came within inches as his header from the middle of the box slipped just left of the frame.</p>\n<p>Feucht and Big West Offensive Player of the Year senior forward Nick DePuy each led the Gauchos with three shots, but Fullerton eventually regained control for the final 10 minutes to see out their second straight postseason victory at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“DePuy has had a great four years, three-time Big West Offensive Player of the year, but I think the one player that kind of drove our team and made so much happen for us was Josue,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>An All-Big West First Team selection in 2015, España provided another dynamic to the Gauchos’ gameplan in his ability to play both on and off the ball.</p>\n<p>“We wish he could’ve come as a freshman but we got him for two years, and you’ll take what you get,” Vom Steeg said. “From that Cal Poly game and on, he has been giving us what he can, but it’s just not 100 percent. When he started to slow down offensively, we really started to slow down because he was the one player that could get us through the midfield.”</p>\n<p>The semifinal was the last match of five Gauchos’ collegiate careers as DePuy, España, midfielder Riley Peterson, midfielder Josue Salgado and captain midfielder Andy Perez will move onto their post-UCSB endeavors.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the graduating class, their final year wasn’t topped off with a conference or national championship, but Vom Steeg will have several holes to fill before the start of next season, a testament to how crucial the outgoing class was to the team’s success.</p>\n<p>Fullerton and CSUN, the two top teams from the South division, will now face off in Northridge Saturday night for the Big West crown.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74157\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-11/gauchos-season-ends-with-2-1-semis-loss-to-cal-state-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74157\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-11/gauchos-season-ends-with-2-1-semis-loss-to-cal-state-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-11/gauchos-season-ends-with-2-1-semis-loss-to-cal-state-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-11/gauchos-season-ends-with-2-1-semis-loss-to-cal-state-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-11/gauchos-season-ends-with-2-1-semis-loss-to-cal-state-fullerton/","id":1409,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1408,1407,1406],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
