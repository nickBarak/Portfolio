The Marathon will start the evening of Feb. 20, running all night. <em>Alex Gonzalez / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Dance Marathon will host UCSB’s third annual Dance Marathon from Feb. 20 to 21 to raise money for the Children’s Miracle Network.</p>\n<p>Dance Marathon is one of the nation’s largest collegiate philanthropy organizations and operates through the Children’s Miracle Network (CMN) and fundraises year-round to provide care for children at each campus’ local CMN hospital. This year, UCSB will be raising money for Cottage Children’s Hospital located in Santa Barbara, CA.</p>\n<p>Samantha Gerraty, second-year dance and biology double major and co-director of Dance Marathon operations, said Dance Marathon began at Indiana University in honor of 18 year-old Ryan White, who passed away from HIV/AIDS in 1991.</p>\n<p>“White was diagnosed with HIV/AIDs, and passed away from the disease before he could attend college,” Gerraty said in an email. “[White’s] friends held a dance marathon, which fundraised for the Riley Hospital for Children, and inspired other students across the nation to start supporting their own local CMN hospitals.”</p>\n<p>Lynn Padlipsky, fourth-year biology major and Dance Marathon executive director, said the organization hopes to raise even more funds than last year.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping to raise a lot of money for Cottage Children’s Medical Center. We are hoping to outdo last year where we raised $35,000,” Padlipsky said in an email. “We are also hoping everyone comes to the event excited and leaves inspired.”</p>\n<p>Padlipsky said the Dance Marathon club at UCSB has focused on getting everyone on campus involved in the event.</p>\n<p>“The organization of the club has changed a bit, and this year we are really focusing on getting all clubs, Greek life and residence halls to participate so all of UCSB is represented,” Padlipsky said in an email.</p>\n<p>Gerraty said participants will be able to meet past recipients of the money raised through Dance Marathon and enjoy games, food and performances by UCSB student groups.</p>\n<p>“At the event, the dancers will have the opportunity to meet five miracle families — children and their families who have been helped by Cottage Children’s Medical Centre — to hear their stories and to play games and dance with them,” Gerraty said in an email. Desirae Lucas, fourth-year psychology major, said she chose to be involved in the marathon this year because she enjoys dancing and supports the event’s charity.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to participate in Dance Marathon this year for a few reasons — the first is because I love to dance and it would be a fun time to spend with all of my friends,” Lucas said. “Second, I think it’s for an amazing cause, and lastly, I also wanted to do it this year because I wasn’t able to make it last year because I got sick.”</p>\n<p>Lucas said she plans to wear comfortable shoes and to dance for the entire 12-hour event.</p>\n<p>“My strategies to survive are bringing very comfy shoes and to just keep dancing — the more you dance, the less time you’ll have to worry about your feet starting to hurt!” Lucas said.</p>\n<p>Sophia Dycaico, first-year undeclared major, said she is excited about the challenge of dancing for 12 hours continuously.</p>\n<p>“I’m most looking forward to showing off my dope dance moves while spending time with great people to support the children,” Dycaico said. “I’m also excited to see how people’s dancing changes as we approach hour 12. Maybe I’ll even challenge a few people to a dance battle.”</p>\n<p>Dycaico said she plans to prepare for the marathon by sleeping well the night before and pacing herself throughout the marathon.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to sleep a full 12 hours the night before, eat food, drink water and pace myself throughout the marathon by saving my best moves for the very end,” Dycaico said. “Plus, I’m going to start training for Dance Marathon by playing a random song on Pandora and having a mini dance party in my dorm every night for the week leading up to dance marathon.”</p>\n<p>To register

UCSB’s Startup Weekend Friday through Sunday at Corwin Pavilion.</p>\n<p>The event allowed attendees to connect with sponsors and company representatives from Dandelion Nitro, SB Hackers, StartupSB, I.V. Cuts, Impact Radius and Citrix. Participating entrepreneurs pitched their ideas on Friday and looked for members to add to their teams. Attendees voted for the top 15 teams, and these teams competed Saturday and Sunday to build the best product.</p>\n<p>The top teams also competed with teams from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, which was hosting its own Startup Weekend.</p>\n<p>Clint Nelsen, co-founder of Startup Weekend and CEO of Ticketbase, brought the event, which takes place in 135 countries, to Santa Barbara in 2009.</p>\n<p>“Over an impromptu lunch, we shook hands to buy the company from [previous owner Andrew Hyde] for about $150,000, and we didn’t have a penny in our bank accounts,” Nelsen said.</p>\n<p>Mark Cardona, who graduated from UCSB in 2009, said his interest in entrepreneurship began with selling candy out of his backpack in middle school.</p>\n<p>“I actually made quite a bit of money doing that, and ever since then I have been trying to build other businesses,” Cardona said.</p>\n<p>ProductPlan founder Jim Semick shared advice on building a business and finding lean market validation.</p>\n<p>“A lot of products come to market, and the founders and people who are starting the company are really excited about it,” Semick said. “They believe their ideas can change the world, and unfortunately the world doesn’t care sometimes. This [weekend] is really the lowest-risk chance for you to get in front of people and talk about your idea.</p>\n<p>Navjot Brar, president of UCSB’s Entrepreneurs Association and fourth-year mechanical engineering major, said there were more student attendees than in past years.</p>\n<p>“This year it is a whole new UCSB crowd and new people being introduced to this Startup Weekend,” Brar said.</p>\n<p>Startup Weekend, which has taken place downtown in past years, was moved to UCSB in part due to financial reasons, according to Brar.</p>\n<p>Brar said Associated Students gave the group $8,000, which was used to buy supplies for the weekend.</p>\n<p>“We have 3D printers set up, we give everyone a free website domain, we give mentorship, presentation feedback — literally everything that you need in a weekend,” Brar said.</p>\n<p>Brar said meeting people who have their own companies is students’ favorite part of Startup Weekend.</p>\n<p>“There was a survey of Startup Weekend, and the number one thing people love the most is the networking. It is just fun, it is natural — it brings you out of your comfort zone,” Brar said.</p>\n<p>15 teams presented a product on Sunday night to six judges.</p>\n<p>Closed Cycle, a bike security device, and Triameter, a room 3D scanner, tied for first.</p>\n<p>Owen Roth, a team member for Closed Cycle, said tying for first “feels awesome,” and the weekend was a rewarding experience that allowed him to engage with new people.</p>\n<p>“The whole experience was an adrenaline rush that put you through a lot of sleepless nights, and then it was a lot of interacting with really intelligent people that had a lot of knowledge,” Roth said. “It was an intense learning experience and so educational. For me it was like going back to college again.”</p>\n<p>Bernie Corea, a team member from Triameter and a third-year economics major, said he did not know anyone on his winning team before beginning the competition.</p>\n<p>“I came here not knowing what to expect,” Corea said. “We started off with initially drone attachments and pivoted very quickly to creating something for real estate agencies to be able to map. We really quickly realized we had a project with huge scalable opportunity.”</p>\n<p>The two first place teams each received a $1,500 patent-filing application, a three month co-working space at the Goleta Entrepreneurial Magnet, 10 hours of access to the “Presidio Board Room” at Workzones for the team, a year-long membership to Startup SB, a startup consult and incorporation package from Cardona Law, a chance to present in front of investors at a Tech Coast Angels Meeting, a one-year membership to the UCSB Entrepreneurs Association and one free haircut from I.V. Cuts for each team member.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67454\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/startup-weekend-attendees-connect-compete/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67454\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/startup-weekend-attendees-connect-compete/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/startup-weekend-attendees-connect-compete/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/startup-weekend-attendees-connect-compete/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/startup-weekend-attendees-connect-compete/","id":2580,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2579,2578,2577],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students, Faculty Brave the Rain for Silent March","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/March_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/March_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"More than 40 students and faculty members marched through the rain Tuesday as part of UC Santa Barbara’s annual silent march in honor of the Rev.

Today’s march is an example of that.”</p>\n<p>King said the march is mostly silent in order to minimize distraction and honor the movement.</p>\n<p>“It is not until we are able to clear our distractions and actually be in silence that we can actually start to hear,” King said. “That is the purpose of this march today: so that we can take some time to actually be in silence and to remember.”</p>\n<p>When the group stopped at North Hall, Aaron Jones, the president of the Graduate Student Association, explained the importance of North Hall.</p>\n<p>“I imagine everyone who woke up that day [in 1968] — with the exception of a select few — had no idea that by the time they rose, 12 students had walked into this building at six o’clock in morning and told the folks there, ‘you’re going to have to leave,’” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Jones said that the act of “nonviolent civil disobedience” had an effect larger than the pictures that now adorn the walls of North Hall.</p>\n<p>“That very act of civil disobedience, of nonviolent civil disobedience, inspired a movement that is not only captured in these images, but in movement that literally reverberates and reverberated around the world,” Jones said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67485\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67485\" data-attachment-id=\"67485\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-19/students-faculty-brave-the-rain-for-silent-march/march_by-lorenzo-basilio-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/March_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1279&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1279\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"March_by Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/March_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C160&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/March_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C568&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67485 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/March_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x655.jpg?resize=888%2C568\" alt=\"March_by Lorenzo Basilio-1\" width=\"888\" height=\"568\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/March_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C655&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/March_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=250%2C160&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/March_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=768%2C491&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/March_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/March_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67485\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Mohsin Mirza, the vice president of statewide affairs for Associated Students and fourth-year sociology major, said MLK’s “human qualities” made him an effective leader.</p>\n<p>“I think often about how Dr. King must’ve felt in all these different moment of his life.

id=\"caption-attachment-67522\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The artwork was welcomed at the grand opening ceremony with a song and dance, both originally composed by a UCSB professor and graduate student, respectively. <em>Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The new art installation titled “Lament” is the first artwork to be featured in the UCSB Library for a year from January 2016 until January 2017, composed of over 2,000 book covers to serve as a tribute to the declining use of physical books.</p>\n<p>“Lament” is a 10-by-32 foot art installation located on the first floor of the new addition to the UCSB Library. The art piece was formally presented at the library grand opening ceremony and was complemented by a song composed by Heena Yoon, a UCSB graduate student, and a dance choreographed by Christina McCarthy, UCSB’s professor of modern dance.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Metzger, assistant university librarian for outreach and academic collaboration, said when she first observed Nancy Gifford’s “Lament” at the Museum of Contemporary Art in downtown Santa Barbara, she thought it would be “perfect” to display in the newly opened library for the year.</p>\n<p>“Usually we actually don’t keep our artwork up for a whole year, but with ‘Lament’ we really wanted to sort of have it be this signature piece that was there for our entire grand opening year,” Metzger said.</p>\n<p>Metzger said the space “Lament” currently occupies will be transformed into other art installations from various artists after this year.</p>\n<p>“We’re calling that space the Mountain Gallery, and we’re open to receiving exhibition proposals from students, from faculty, from curators, from artists who want to show their work in that space,” Metzger said.</p>\n<p>Nancy Gifford, “Lament” artist, said she enjoyed the dance and music piece performed at the library grand opening ceremony to complement her work.</p>\n<p>“When a piece of art inspires other forms of art,” Gifford said. “They performed the whole thing in front of the piece at the opening, and that was really beautiful.”</p>\n<p>Anastasia McCammon, a third-year dance and art history major, said she performed at the ceremony and enjoyed how the dance was different from others she has participated in because it incorporated speaking and improvisation.</p>\n<p>“We were all enthralled,” McCammon said. “We seriously spent most of the rehearsal just deciphering and remarking at the tiny little details, amusing placements and hidden messages of the collage of books, pages, images and bindings. It is incredible how well the mural fit into what our dance aimed to portray.”</p>\n<p>Heena Yoon, a third-year composition major Ph.D. candidate, said she “fell in love” when she first saw the artwork and sees it as a visual embodiment of the musical piece she was working on.</p>\n<p>“I wanted the piece to be an homage to great books and music pieces past and present,” Yoon said. “To be presented by dancers and live musicians right here and now, and to be remembered by the audience throughout their future, not as ‘Heena Yoon’s music’ but as ‘Oh I saw a fun music-dance-theater piece, and it reminded me of the storybooks I loved.’”</p>\n<p>Gifford said she appreciates the unexpected positive responses to her work she received in person and in her comments book despite the work being a “requiem” for books.</p>\n<p>“I looked through [the comments book] a couple weeks ago and I was really moved by all the comments,” Gifford said. “I was very moved by all the things, even the comments that weren’t positive — it doesn’t matter, it’s still a dialogue that’s going on about books, which is what the whole point of it is.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, January 21, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67540\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/lament-artwork-to-stay-in-library-until-2017/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67540\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/lament-artwork-to-stay-in-library-until-2017/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/lament-artwork-to-stay-in-library-until-2017/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/lament-artwork-to-stay-in-library-until-2017/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/lament-artwork-to-stay-in-library-until-2017/","id":2582,"author":{"id":135,"name":"Kiana Triana"},"related":[2581,2580,2579],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
