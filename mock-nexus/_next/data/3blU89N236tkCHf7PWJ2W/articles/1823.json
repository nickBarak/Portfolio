So far, no one has broken any rules; they’re taking it seriously.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neumann said that he aimed to have the server as precise as possible, having users follow a 1-meter-per-block scale and directing them to use Google Earth for measurements. Members of the Discord server have been sending pictures of buildings for references as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first completed structure was UCSB’s signature Storke Tower, soon followed by Storke Plaza, the UCen and the Arbor, said Neumann; the University Library is also in progress. Once campus construction is finished, the project will expand to rebuilding Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neumann said his overall goal is to build the campus to such an accurate degree that when someone explores the completed server, it feels like the real deal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Neumann, the server has been experiencing technical issues due to heavy traffic on the hosting site. With this being his first time running a large server, Neumann has been doing his best to keep members updated on the server’s status, actively posting announcements on the Discord and Facebook groups. Once the technical issues are resolved, Neumann hopes to incorporate a survival portion to the world, which includes player-versus-player elements, and hold weekend events within the server. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later in the quarter, Neumann said he is looking forward to celebrating a Minecraft graduation with everyone in the community. But for now, the main focus has been constructing the campus in creative mode, a feature that allows users to build freely with access to all the materials within the game, in addition to just spending time indoors and following the state’s stay-at-home order. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93901\" style=\"width: 1093px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-04-08/ucsb-minecraft-server-building-a-home-away-from-home/library-5/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-93901\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93901\" data-attachment-id=\"93901\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-08/ucsb-minecraft-server-building-a-home-away-from-home/library-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?fit=1083%2C609&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1083,609\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"library\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-93901 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?resize=888%2C499\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?w=1083&amp;ssl=1 1083w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93901\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Charles Neumann</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thomas Montero, a third-year physics major and active member in the community, is responsible for starting the construction of the University Library and many other structures in the server.

However, all appointments have been transferred to virtual Zoom meetings, and 24-hour crisis hotlines remain active. In addition, the C.A.P.S.

continue their work, it must be conducted remotely until the outbreak is contained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Researchers were given two days to cease any ongoing on-campus research, according to a </span><a href=\"https://www.research.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/docs/covid-19/Shutdown-of-All-On-Campus-Research-3-18-2020.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">memo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from Incandela sent out on March 18. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The shutdown of on-campus research will create unanticipated delays, which can be cause for significant anxiety for many, and especially junior, researchers,” Incandela wrote in the memo.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While there is no way to escape the loss of time, every effort is being made to assure that these actions will not damage careers or lead to excessive financial hardship,” he continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the memo does provide some exceptions to the remote research mandate, including those who are researching coronavirus.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Requests to allow COVID-19 studies or the continuation of ongoing essential experiments” can be submitted through a form for consideration, the memo read, but “few exceptions [are] to be granted.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research equipment, such as chemicals, are not allowed to be taken off campus. For laboratories or equipment that require continued maintenance or activity, the memo asks researchers to “spell out why and what continued tasks are necessary and identify a minimum number of essential personnel who will be responsible for this critical maintenance.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incandela said funding for researchers’ pay was a concern early on, but that the federal</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> agencies, which provide most of the funding for researchers, would continue to fund research now conducted at home. </span><a href=\"https://www.research.ucsb.edu/covid-19-guidance-proposals-and-awards\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New information</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding employee wages is being made available to researchers as well, Incandela said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mahdi Abu-Omar, a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry whose research focuses on renewable energy, said that despite the shutdown, there’s still a lot of work to be done.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re experimentalists, but there’s work that we do offline in terms of writing papers and preparing and planning and processing data,” Abu-Omar said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Of course not being able to do experiments is holding us back a little bit. But [writing and preparing data] for the next several weeks is manageable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the coronavirus outbreak, Abu-Omar had been anticipating the arrival of a scientist and a professor from overseas this summer, but after UCSB’s research shutdown, “both of these jobs are postponed until we figure out what’s going on,” Abu-Omar said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the shuttering of research on campus, there are still alternatives for student researchers, such as proposing ideas for future projects, Incandela said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students can read and learn a lot about how the research they planned to do is connected to previous results. This is just one example, and I am sure there are many other possibilities like running simulations or brain-storming about something completely new,” Incandela explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This may be an unprecedented period of thought and reflection that brings many new ideas to campus for future research.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
