precedent in creating a more environmentally friendly setting within the campus and improving the quality and health of the lives of students who will be living in these off-campus dorms next year.</p>\n<p>The San Joaquin apartment renovations are one of the largest projects underway at UC Santa Barbara, with a proposed amount of $122 million going toward construction and an estimated 670,000 hours worked to date.</p>\n<p>Upon completion, it will accommodate 186 units, housing a total of 1,019 beds for potential students living on campus over 14 acres of site development, all while including new sustainable and energy-saving features.</p>\n<p>The apartments will use the standards of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), a global green building certification program, in addition to current campus green building goals in measuring their environmental efficiency.</p>\n<p>Such certifications are based on the various components of the apartment complex and how efficiently these different factors contribute to a more environmentally friendly site, according to the LEED construction certification requirements.</p>\n<p>Many of the buildings featured within the San Joaquin apartment complexes will be able to reach the LEED Gold standard, the second highest green-efficiency level behind Platinum.</p>\n<p>Among the new features of San Joaquin apartment complexes is a revamped version of the Portola Dining Commons, a marketplace at which students can buy groceries, as well as various outdoor recreational facilities such as basketball and volleyball courts.</p>\n<p>“It’s almost like a mini-campus away from campus,” said Marc Rousseau, the energy and environmental manager for residential operations. “[The marketplace] will make it easier for students to not have to go all the way down to Costco to shop for groceries.”</p>\n<p>Rousseau said the original intent behind making these apartments more environmentally friendly was in response to student demands at UC meetings in pushing for greener construction as well as sustainability in the buildings.</p>\n<p>“I like to say that it’s student-driven why we’re here,” he said.</p>\n<p>Brian Graham, project manager for the construction site, said in addition to the apartment buildings being more environmentally friendly, such installments will help save costs of maintenance and repair in the future.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the sustainable buildings do cost more upfront, but they do have a somewhat higher payback,” Graham said.</p>\n<p>Features such as sensor-based lights, which remotely turn off when not being used, as well as the use of recycled water, help alleviate the costs of energy consumption.</p>\n<p>Rousseau said while the environmental aspects of San Joaquin are major highlights in its construction, it is only one small project in the larger view of environmental conservation efforts.</p>\n<p>“This project isn’t going to save the world,” he said. “But it’s a great example of things that operators and building owners can do when they make a change.”</p>\n<p>Rousseau said such environmental efforts are created in the hopes of improving both the lives of students and workers within the community. Greater understanding of these environmental aspects can lead to more awareness of the topic of environmental conservation, he said.</p>\n<p>“It’s to build an environmentally friendly building and a building which students can live safely and learn in,” Rousseau said. “That’s why we’re here. And to live in a community that’s comfortable and healthy.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, April 20, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77184\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/san-joaquin-dorms-update/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77184\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/san-joaquin-dorms-update/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/san-joaquin-dorms-update/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/san-joaquin-dorms-update/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/san-joaquin-dorms-update/","id":2390,"author":{"id":97,"name":"Matthew Wu"},"related":[2389,2388,2387],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Paranoid?

The cameras are purchased by the department and, according to Howard, typically cost between $300 and $1,200.</p>\n<p>There is not, however, a thorough policy in place that outlines the steps taken to install a camera, and the university is currently in the process of drafting a new policy for installing security cameras. The university’s latest policy was created in May 2008.</p>\n<p>Matthew Hall, associate vice chancellor and chief information officer, said that under current policy, camera footage is accessed and monitored by each department that owns the camera. The footage is only released during police investigations or when there is compelling interest to uncover what was filmed.</p>\n<p>Hall noted that the university is in the process of creating a new policy to specifically outline the regulation of camera use.</p>\n<p>“It’ll vary by various departments, and this is a reason why we’ve started the dialogue,” Hall said. “We want a policy that says, ‘If you’re going to manage a camera, there are practices and standards to which you have to adhere that balance privacy, safety and security.’”</p>\n<p>The group drafting the new university policy was created around four months ago and consists of law enforcement, university administrators, university staff members and Jennifer Lofthus, the chief of information and security officer.</p>\n<p>The UC Office of the President is also creating a new system-wide policy change.</p>\n<p>According to Hall, security cameras pose an “ethical burden” due to controversy between increasing surveillance and maintaining people’s privacy. He also described them as a “monetary burden” because individual departments pay for their installed cameras.</p>\n<p>Hall noted that the installation of security cameras undergoes a different process for interior and exterior cameras, as “staff issues and union issues” may arise when such groups deny access to being filmed inside buildings.</p>\n<p>“We have to consider there are certain labor classifications that explicitly prohibit this particular thing,” he said.</p>\n<p>Hall said he wants the future policy to include a requirement to attend a privacy training for those who request cameras to learn how “to respect the privacy of our community.”</p>\n<p>Many students may not be aware of security cameras, and Hall said the new policy will designate more signage to show students where they are being surveilled.</p>\n<p>Hall said he estimates that the policy will be completed by the end of the calendar year.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to get everybody to a similar standard,” Hall said. “The policy is deliberate and thoughtful, and we want to make sure there’s time for review and there’s time for dissemination and there’s time for criticism.”</p>\n<p>Ruby Stewart, a first-year psychology major, was studying on the fourth floor of the library when she noticed the security camera hovering above her.</p>\n<p>“I honestly didn’t know there was cameras,” she said. “I don’t feel uncomfortable, though, because I feel like it kind of makes sense. I feel like if they’re misusing it, just to kind of like, watch us, that’s creepy. But if they have like a purpose, then it’s fine with me.”</p>\n<p>Stewart said she thinks the cameras would be useful if there were a crime in the library, but she said students should be more aware of the cameras’ presence on campus.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t know … so obviously there should be more signs,” she said. “Because if you have signs, people will say, ‘Oh, there’s cameras, I shouldn’t do anything stupid in here.’”</p>\n<p>According to Gary Johnson, the associate university librarian for research and scholar services, there are cameras on every floor of the library, the majority being on the first floor due to the amount of general and emergency exits.</p>\n<p>Hall said he wants to remind students that they are “under constant personal surveillance in the world,” and the presence of cameras on a university campus is typical due to the high volume of visitors and amount of expensive infrastructure and research equipment.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to clarify [students’] rights through policy,” Hall said. “The university has not only a right but a compelling interest in surveilling an area to make sure you’re safe and to make sure our property is protected.”</p>\n<p>Abigail Hunt, a first-year biology major, said she doesn’t mind having cameras on campus because they act as a “safety precaution.”</p>\n<p>“It makes me feel safe, like if something did happen they’d be able to record it,” Hunt said. “But I don’t feel the need to know where things are because I don’t feel like I do anything that I should worried about being watched.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story

Here are highlights for answers to questions from the moderator, Mary Zhu:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>CONNECTIONS:</b> Zhu asked the candidates if they have sustainable statewide networks to work with as EVPSA. Hsu cited her past three years of experience in A.S., specifically her involvement in the UCSB Federal Advocacy Program that sends students to Washington D.C. to lobby, which has established networks at the federal and UC level. Dagnachew said that as mental health coordinator, he helped start peer programs similar to UCSB’s at UCLA and UC Irvine. He said he has met other student leaders at U.S. Student Association (USSA) with similar if not the same goals for fighting tuition hikes.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>GRASSROOTS OR LOBBYING?: </b>Hsu said change comes with both lobbying and grassroots organizing and it is important to realize that students have different strengths in participating to voice their concerns. Dagnachew agreed that both lobbying and grassroots work are effective, and he said he wants to work toward having students see the connection with their own efforts to the actions going on at the state and federal levels.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>STUDENT ACCESSIBILITY:</b> In response to a question about increasing student accessibility to the EVPSA, Dagnachew said his involvement in various organizations, canvassing for student programs such as CLAS and working as a Resident Assistant have prepared him to reach out to students. Hsu said it can be a challenge to be approachable, but she hopes to focus on communicating legislation to students that is not always clear to understand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Campaigning for A.S. elections began on Sunday and and will continue for the next two weeks until voting results are announced on the night of April 27.</p>\n<p>Profiles of all 51 A.S. candidates can be found <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2017/\">here</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77084\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vise-president-of-statewide-affairs-debate-dagnachew-vs-hsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77084\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vise-president-of-statewide-affairs-debate-dagnachew-vs-hsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vise-president-of-statewide-affairs-debate-dagnachew-vs-hsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vise-president-of-statewide-affairs-debate-dagnachew-vs-hsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vise-president-of-statewide-affairs-debate-dagnachew-vs-hsu/","id":2388,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2387,2386,2385],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
