However, this will not lead to abandoning meat altogether anytime soon. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Veganism is trending in both the food industry and in student requests for more vegan options on the menu, and the dining commons have heeded the call.</p>\n<p>Dining Services Dietitian Danielle Kemp said the increased popularity of plant-based foods has been relatively recent.</p>\n<p>“It’s been in the last few years, but it becomes more and more apparent,” she said in an interview on Tuesday. “I keep getting more stuff in magazines and from manufacturers about products that they’re making.”</p>\n<p>Vegan and vegetarian options have greatly increased within the past seven years, starting with the student-led push for Green Monday in 2009, a couple of years before Kemp started working with UCSB.</p>\n<p>“There was a need from the students for vegan and vegetarian options that probably happened before my time,” she said, adding that this was followed by another push from within the administration itself.</p>\n<p>A few years after the launching of Green Monday, the executive chef of the dining commons headed the development of more vegan and vegetarian entrée options. In one summer, he developed a menu and started tastings for the management staff, creating much of what the dining commons offer today.</p>\n<p>“We offer a vegan and a vegetarian entrée at each dining commons,” Kemp said. “So there are available options, usually all the time.”</p>\n<p>However, the options are never provided at all the commons for any given meal.</p>\n<p>“A student may have to go to a different dining common to find a vegan option,” she said. “So they have to kind of figure out where they need to go depending on who’s serving what.”</p>\n<p>Kemp said although there are not always entrée options available, the design of the menu allows for more flexibility.</p>\n<p>“There are other staples like baked potatoes, sweet potatoes, rice and beans that are offered all the time,” she said. “So you can be pretty creative.”</p>\n<p>Several other sources of inspiration for the food at the dining commons include conferences, magazines and food conventions. These sources serve as tools to keep the staff up to date on health discoveries, new recipes and new products.</p>\n<p>“I do think the plant-based [trend] has been growing,” she said of the current patterns within the food industry.</p>\n<p>Kemp said she is pleased about the trend and about its influence in the dining commons.</p>\n<p>“As a dietitian, you want to incorporate more plant-based foods into your diet,” Kemp said.</p>\n<p>She is sure to add that it is all about balance, and while they are providing more options for vegans, the dining commons will not be abandoning meat anytime soon.</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t say we’re trying to move away from meat,” Kemp said. “We’re trying to give education on why incorporating more plant-based foods into your diet is good.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, April 28, 2016 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70484\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/campus-dining-offers-more-vegan-choices/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70484\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/campus-dining-offers-more-vegan-choices/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/campus-dining-offers-more-vegan-choices/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/campus-dining-offers-more-vegan-choices/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/campus-dining-offers-more-vegan-choices/","id":2489,"author":{"id":112,"name":"Natalie Overton"},"related":[2488,2487,2486],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":112,"name":"Natalie Overton","biography":"Not available","articles":[2477,2489,2495,2563],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Writing Program Creates Science Minor","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/scienceminorart.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/scienceminorart.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Starting next fall, UC Santa Barbara will offer a writing minor for science communication, teaching students to share scientific information with a diverse audience.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Starting next fall, UC Santa Barbara will offer a writing minor for science communication, teaching students to share scientific information with a diverse audience.</p>\n<p>The writing program has been developing the minor for 18 months and will accept applications in the fall for classes beginning in Winter Quarter.

Instead, she said all organizations must seek to understand science and its worldwide implications.</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen, very recently, several discussions going on in both the news and among politicians about things like climate change, questions about vaccinations, questions about various topics … questions all about policy making,” Lunsford said.</p>\n<p>Lunsford said students from all departments are encouraged to apply for the minor if they have an interest in understanding scientific research.</p>\n<p>“As long as you’re interested in a S.T.E.M. topic, we can help teach you how to read that material,” Lunsford said. “It is a different route from someone who already has that major, but we do need people coming in from both directions, seeing what people can understand and interpret for another audience.”</p>\n<p>Professor Doug Bradley, who will teach scientific literacy in the Winter Quarter, said his class will specialize in learning the basic concepts of science and how students can use multimedia to deliver the information to a large audience.</p>\n<p>Bradley said course assignments will have students presenting data in “unique ways” to connect non-S.T.E.M. people to the science field through scientific and quantitative graphics.</p>\n<p>“In terms of science communication, good practice would be to connect as efficiently as possible with your audience, a broad audience … and convey ideas and issues to them that will get them to orient their lives in ways that accord with rational scientific thinking,” Bradley said.</p>\n<p>Professor Janet Mizrahi, who will be teaching science communication for the public, said her students will spend Spring Quarter writing press releases and news stories, creating websites and recording podcasts.</p>\n<p>Mizrahi wants students to learn the best ways to communicate in the workplace through writing and technology, regardless of the career they eventually pursue.<br>\n“I hope they not only become better citizens and better writers, but also more marketable college graduates,” Mizrahi said.</p>\n<p>Bradley said “it is particularly urgent right now,” for students to learn from the minor because UCSB was recently ranked eighth in worldwide research by the international Leiden Ranking system.</p>\n<p>“That means our professionals need to make darn sure the information they’re conveying to the public is spot on target,” he continued. “We’re trying to support that leadership that the campus is already showing and push it out even further.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the

Courtesy of SBCC</em></p></div>\n<p>Vice President Joe Biden announced Monday a $100 million expansion of free tuition programs similar to Santa Barbara City College’s (SBCC) newly instituted “College Promise.”</p>\n<p>These funds will be used for initiatives that include tuition-free partnerships with community colleges, as well as training programs between employers and students.</p>\n<p>This money is part of President Barack Obama’s College Promise to further bridge students’ educational opportunities and employer needs, making education and work force training attainable to middle and lower class students.</p>\n<p>The SBCC Board of Trustees enacted its own resolution in January, deemed SBCC’s College Promise, to support Obama’s plan. The resolution provides incoming students with two years of fully covered tuition, as long as the students are from local high schools.</p>\n<p>SBCC Board of Trustees member and UCSB graduate Jonathan Abboud said SBCC’s College Promise is the most ambitious resolution of any community college in the country. He said the city college’s resolution also covers books and fees, although students would need to pay for their own housing and transportation.</p>\n<p>“The assumption is that most students will be living at home during this time, as they are local,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Following Obama’s 2015 State of the Union Address, in which he furthered his goals for America’s College Promise, 27 new free community college programs have launched nationwide, including SBCC’s.</p>\n<p>Abboud said the federal government has not yet funded SBCC’s resolution, which is currently being funded through local, private philanthropy.</p>\n<p>The goal of making the first two years of college virtually free is to make the concept of college less daunting and easily attainable for students, according to Abboud. He said once students get this crucial jumpstart, they could either transfer to a four-year university or enter into the workforce having learned necessary technical skills for many entry-level jobs.</p>\n<p>“This plan is part of our effort to fulfill our role in California’s master plan: Get people into college and off to higher education,” Abboud said. “This kick start is crucial for many students who would otherwise not have the means to do so.”</p>\n<p>Emily O’Kelly, a second-year at SBCC who will be transferring to UCSB in the fall, said she could have benefited greatly from the benefits of such a program at SBCC.</p>\n<p>“I think that supplying an increased number of community colleges with free tuition would be a wise investment in our own economy,” O’Kelly said. “Breaking down the monetary barrier to higher education translates into an increased number of students, which in the end supplies our work force with a larger amount of capable and trained individuals.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, April 28, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

McLane Brown / Daily Nexus </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>\n<p>Seventy-five dancers, each barefoot, dressed in all white and carrying a simple white terracotta plate performed a ritualistic dance in Storke Plaza on Monday to celebrate peace and to mark the second anniversary of the May 23, 2014, shooting.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Department of Theater and Dance, in conjunction with the Buglisi Dance Theatre of New York, performed the “Table of Silence Project,” a dance originally choreographed by Jacqulyn Buglisi, director of the Buglisi Dance Theatre. The hour-long ceremony was first performed at the Lincoln Center on the tenth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.</p>\n<p>The ritual honored the lives of Weihan Wang, Cheng Hong, George Chen, Katherine Cooper, Veronika Weiss and Christopher Michaels-Martinez, and simultaneously acted as a call and celebration for peace and unity.</p>\n<p>The dancers moved in unison along circular patterns reminiscent of a mandala and culminated the ritual in a minute of silence, seated in concentric circles and their arms outstretched, palms facing up to the sky.</p>\n<p>“Today we stop and remember these six students and celebrate their beautiful lives,” Chancellor Henry T. Yang said in his opening statement.</p>\n<p>To memorialize the lives and contributions of the six students, Chancellor Yang presented six scholarships to current UCSB students prior to the Table of Silence performance. The student recipients were Lindsey Choate, Jennie Christensen, Aileen Fullchange, Joshua Ortiz, Taylor J. Stolzfus and Michael Teller.</p>\n<p>“Each of these recipients reflects the character, passions, kindness, intelligence and ambition of the six students we lost, ensuring that they will always live on in UC Santa Barbara,” Yang said. “They are true leaders who have shown a deep commitment to their education and their community.”</p>\n<p>According to Buglisi, the choreographer of the ritual, the dancers descended upon the plaza “forming patterns of concentric circles to create a Peace Labyrinth, seen as in ancient times.”</p>\n<p>“As they form the Peace Labyrinth, they will bring out the mandala energy, symbolizing the eternity, purity and continuity of the life cycle,” Buglisi said. “Creating a ritual honoring our natural world around us, for peace and harmony.”</p>\n<p>Patrick Lindley, principal musician of UCSB Theater and Dance, was the musical director for the Table of Silence Project. The dancers performed in collaboration with Azeem Ward on flute, William Pasley and Russ Glick on percussion, Emiliano Campobello on flute and conch shell, Margo Halstead on carillon and vocals provided by UCSB’s a cappella group Naked Voices.</p>\n<p>In a closing statement, UCSB’s Chair of the Academic Senate Kum-Kum Bhavnani addressed those who passed away in remembrance.</p>\n<p>“We feel, we hope, we trust that your souls are at peace,” Bhavnani said. “We will always remember you. Fiat lux, let there be light.”</p>\n<p><em>[Update May 24, 2:00 p.m. : This article has been updated to include a full list of performers.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71272\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/dancers-perform-at-storke-plaza-in-remembrance-of-may-23-to-celebrate-peace/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71272\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/dancers-perform-at-storke-plaza-in-remembrance-of-may-23-to-celebrate-peace/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/dancers-perform-at-storke-plaza-in-remembrance-of-may-23-to-celebrate-peace/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/dancers-perform-at-storke-plaza-in-remembrance-of-may-23-to-celebrate-peace/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-23/dancers-perform-at-storke-plaza-in-remembrance-of-may-23-to-celebrate-peace/","id":2486,"author":{"id":115,"name":"Sierra Deak"},"related":[2485,2484,2483],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
