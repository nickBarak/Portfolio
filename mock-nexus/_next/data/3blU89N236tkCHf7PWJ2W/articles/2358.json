to hold a candlelight memorial for the lives lost. <em>Hugh Cook / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>MCC Director Zaveeni Khan-Marcus said events like those in Charlottesville are “a threat to human dignity” and are amplified due to the current national political climate.</p>\n<p>Khan-Marcus said it is critical that the UCSB and Isla Vista community engage in dialogue about racism and violence that can affect and harm Americans beyond the events of Charlottesville.</p>\n<p>Kareen Louis, the counselor and coordinator for the UCSB African diasporic Cultural Resource Center, said at the memorial that student discussions are important and can have “transforming and healing powers” as students process the emotions associated with racial hatred and violence.</p>\n<p>Evan Quash, a second-year statistical science and black studies major, told the <em>Nexus</em> that the memorial created a space where he and others could release their anger and sadness and provided resources for more support.</p>\n<p>Quash said the memorial allowed people to share personal stories of victimization and racism and said he believes the energy felt at the memorial can be “channeled” into grassroot organizing throughout the community.</p>\n<p>Puente said the memorial will promote discussion about combating racism, and she hopes the community will move forward from the hatred in Charlottesville and plan for effective change.</p>\n<p>“[We] plan to continue creating opportunities for the community to come together for critical conversations and action,” Puente said.</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-78383\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The crew of six confronted great white sharks, April fog and uncharitable ships in their 13-mile journey across the Santa Barbara Channel to Anacapa Island. The one-way trip took eight hours. <em>Courtesy of Byron Roos-Collins</em></p></div>\n<p>They had been training for months to trek the 13 miles across the channel, but nothing could prepare them for what lay ahead.</p>\n<p>The group launched at 8 a.m. from Channel Islands Beach in Oxnard and soon met several hiccups.</p>\n<p>To begin, the group had not weight-checked their kayaks prior to launching, and, as a result, some members capsized within the first few hours.</p>\n<p>They also discovered that the radios that they had brought were malfunctioning, which left the kayakers unable to call in for help in the event of an emergency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a thick marine layer of fog that April morning made for especially low visibility. Byron Roos-Collins, fourth-year political science major, said the group could hardly see further than a mile ahead of them. Much of their trek across the channel incidentally followed a zigzag course.</p>\n<p>After paddling for several hours, the group of six reached the middle of the channel, a site of high traffic for cargo ships.</p>\n<p>As the kayakers waited for a cargo ship to pass, they spotted a dorsal fin emerge from the water approximately 20 feet away. It was a distinctly triangular fin jutting nearly three feet above the ocean surface, one that the kayakers knew could only belong to a great white shark.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen thousands and thousands of dolphins and whales, and this was neither of those,” Roos-Collins said.</p>\n<p>With the large freighters still passing by around them, the group found themselves unable to paddle away from the shark; they were stuck. The six kayakers had no choice but to stay put and prepare for the worst.</p>\n<p>Anticipating that the shark might mistake the kayaks for seals, the group put their kayaks together to form a larger vessel. Each person had a spear gun or buck knife at the ready.</p>\n<p>Nik Frey, a UCSB alumnus who had recently returned from volunteering as a frontline medic in Mosul, Iraq, began giving the group instructions on how to apply a tourniquet, just in case anyone in the group lost an extremity in a bout with the shark. He also advised that, in the event of a shark attack, the kayakers stab the shark in its “sensitive face” rather than spearing it “willy-nilly.”</p>\n<p>When the freighters passed, the kayakers immediately took the opportunity to make a full charge toward the island. They only made it halfway across the shipping lanes when they spotted the dorsal fin of yet another great white shark.</p>\n<p>“That one was more disheartening I think,” Roos-Collins said.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the shark was uninterested and passed by the group.</p>\n<p>Spirits were low at this point, and the kayakers decided that they would wave down the next boat that passed them in hopes that it would rescue them.</p>\n<p>When a boat finally did pass by, the group waved their hands in the air and blew whistles to get the driver’s attention. Frey said the driver “must have seen” them, but the boat did not stop for them. The group was left “totally abandoned,” Frey said.</p>\n<p>“They gave us no love; they just kept on going,” Roos-Collins said. “It was pretty clear they had seen us.”</p>\n<p>Help was nowhere to be found, and the group knew they had no choice but to finish the trip. Establishing their compass angle again, the kayakers set off to reach Anacapa Island before the close of day.</p>\n<p>After a few hours more paddling through heavy fog, the kayakers were in close enough proximity to the island to see its ghostly shape. It was at this point, Frey said, that the group realized their incorrect compass angle nearly led them to miss the island entirely.</p>\n<p>The kayakers immediately corrected their bearings, pointing the tips of vessels toward the large land mass in the distance. With strong winds at their sides, however, the kayakers had to angle themselves in such a way that the wind would hit the tail of the kayak.</p>\n<p>“Coming to that island was glorious,” Frey said. “Being able to see the island was great. If we couldn’t see the island, then there’s a very likely chance we wouldn’t have made it.”</p>\n<p>The kayakers finally reached the shores of Anacapa Island at 4 p.m., approximately eight hours after first launching from Oxnard.</p>\n<p>Roos-Collins said their arrival greatly surprised the park ranger, who before that point was the only other person on the narrow archipelago composed mostly of jagged volcanic basalt. The primary occupants of the island were thousands of seagulls, highly aggressive during mating season.</p>\n<p>The group set up camp for the night in a site that they had reserved prior to embarking on the trip. They sat atop a high rock formation and enjoyed what Roos-Collins called “one of the most satisfying sunsets” he had ever seen.</p>\n<p>Daniel Connell, fourth-year financial math and statistics major, said the linguini that they ate that night was the highlight of the trip.</p>\n<p>The six kayakers spent the next morning freediving and exploring the island’s various caves until a pre-booked ferry picked them up in the afternoon and took them back to the mainland.</p>\n<p>On their ferry trip back, the six students and alumni shared a beer, reveling in a trip that had turned out to be a success despite many setbacks along the way.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78409\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78409\" data-attachment-id=\"78409\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/channel-surfers-battle-rough-seas-in-13-mile-voyage/kayakers-3-court-of-byron-roos-collins/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?fit=2048%2C1134&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1134\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"kayakers 3 court of Byron Roos-Collins\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?fit=250%2C138&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?fit=888%2C492&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78409 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins-1024x567.jpg?resize=888%2C492\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"492\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?resize=1024%2C567&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?resize=250%2C138&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?resize=768%2C425&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78409\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">After spending the next morning freediving and exploring the island’s various caves, the six kayakers enjoyed a beer on their a pre-booked ferry back to the mainland. <em>Courtesy of Byron Roos-Collins</em></p></div>\n<p>Set to graduate in a little over a week, Roos-Collins said no other adventure he embarked on in the past year can top last month’s trek to Anacapa Island.</p>\n<p>For Connell, who will also be graduating soon, the kayak trip ranks “damn near the top” among his overall experiences as a UCSB student.</p>\n<p>“We’re fortunate enough to have ocean views from our homes currently, and waking up in the morning and going out on the deck and actually seeing those islands in the distance is kind of a constant reminder of the journey,” Connell said. “I can kind of look in the distance and see where we encountered some sharks and where we were eating salami.

I am truly grateful for all of the opportunities coming my way.”</p>\n<p>The conference was free for the participants and their families thanks to AISA members raising the necessary funds.</p>\n<p>Bradford said their funding comes from “several partners across campus,” including the Chancellor’s and Vice Chancellor’s office, several academic and student affairs departments and A.S. organizations including Community Affairs Board, Student Commission on Racial Equality and Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee.</p>\n<p>Their main source of funding is the Student-Initiated Outreach Program (SIOP), Bradford said. They also receive donations from various partners on and off campus.</p>\n<p>According to the 2016-17 UCSB Campus Profile, Native American students make up 1 percent of the graduate and undergraduate student population, and Bradford said there are currently about 240 self-identified Native American graduate and undergraduate students enrolled at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“This means that these students self-identified on their applications when they were applying to UCSB,” Bradford said.</p>\n<p>She also said, however, that there is no accurate way to identify the actual percentage of Native American students on campus because some students may be multiracial or multiethnic and choose to identify with other demographics when applying.</p>\n<p>Some students, she said, do not disclose their race or ethnicity because it is not required.</p>\n<p>“Some of our AISA members chose not to identify on the application … but of all the UC schools, we enroll the greatest number of self-identified American Indians,” Bradford said.</p>\n<p>Bradford said the organization tabled at the S.T.E.M. Student Welcome day last year where members talked about Indigenous science and ways of taking action on campus in support of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline through fundraisers, honorings and activism.</p>\n<p>The group experienced record-high membership during the 2016-17 school year and attended a dinner with Student Affairs Staff to discuss Native American experiences in April.</p>\n<p>Jeike Meijer, a first-year global and feminist studies double major of Arawak heritage, said it is comforting “to know that you’re not alone” as a Native American student.</p>\n<p>Meijer said everyone in the group is “incredibly welcoming,” and she hopes to become more involved throughout the rest of her undergraduate years.</p>\n<p>Meijer said it is difficult to mobilize more students because of the lack of Native American visibility and hopes to create more opportunities for Native American students as a newly elected Assembly District Delegate for the California Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>“In America there are things that Native Americans go through and face that other people don’t necessarily recognize or think about,” Meijer said. “When you get into a group with other Native American students that realize this, it is very unifying because shared experiences and thoughts allow us to connect.”</p>\n<p>K’Ehleyr McNulty, an AISA member who will soon be graduating with degree in earth science, said AISA is the one place she can feel “worthy” of her own experiences and opinions.</p>\n<p>An Arizona native, McNulty said the organization has become an extension of her home and her Ohlone Costanoan Esselen Native American Nation during her time at UCSB. She said it has become a place where Native American students can find commonalities with one another in their heritage.</p>\n<p>She said she hopes the group will grow in the following years after she graduates in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>“It is the one place I can feel myself the most on this campus,” McNulty said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78411\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/american-indian-student-association-wins-osl-group-of-the-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78411\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/american-indian-student-association-wins-osl-group-of-the-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/american-indian-student-association-wins-osl-group-of-the-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/american-indian-student-association-wins-osl-group-of-the-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/american-indian-student-association-wins-osl-group-of-the-year/","id":2357,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2356,2355,2354],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
