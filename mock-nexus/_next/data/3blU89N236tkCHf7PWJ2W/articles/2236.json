The bill passed its final vote in the California State Senate on Aug. 30, 2018.</p>\n<p>The bill would have required all University of California and California State University campuses to offer the pills by Jan. 1, 2022, including UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“It is the intent of the Legislature that public university student health centers make abortion by medication techniques as accessible and cost-effective for students as possible, and thus public university student health centers should treat abortion by medication techniques as a basic health service,” according to the bill’s text.</p>\n<p>The<em> Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/abortion-pill-clears-hurdle-on-path-to-public-universities/#search\">previously reported</a> that The National Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), a non-partisan council, released a report on March 16 that confirmed that the Mifeprex pill is safe and effective.</p>\n<p>Support for this bill came largely from the Women’s Foundation and the Tara Health Foundation. The two foundations <a href=\"http://justcarecalifornia.org/press/national-academies-of-sciences-report-on-abortion-context-experts-on-sb-320/\">helped fund</a> the implementation of SB 320 into public universities.</p>\n<p>“We are disappointed that Gov. Brown failed to support what the Senate, the Assembly, and 6 in 10 Californians already have recognized in this groundbreaking bill — that students of California need abortion care on campus,” Surina Khan, the CEO of The Women’s Foundation of California, said in a <a href=\"https://womensfoundca.org/news/governor-brown-vetoes-campus-abortion-bill/\">press release</a>.</p>\n<p>“We choose to listen to students, not those in power who continually deny their reproductive rights.

The university is demanding less security and more inequality for tens of thousands of its workers, and that is completely at odds with its promise to ‘pioneer a better future’ for California.”</p>\n<p>Today’s protests at UCSB were part of a much bigger UC-wide demonstration that encompasses all 10 campuses.</p>\n<p>Protestors will strike from Oct. 23 to Oct. 25, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. They will hold rallies from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. each day under Storke Tower.</p>\n<p>Nothing has improved for AFSCME workers since the last demonstration, according to Bill Fitzpatrick, campus representative of University Professional &amp; Technical Employees (UPTE).</p>\n<p>UPTE workers are striking this week in solidarity with AFSCME.</p>\n<p>“The university has now forced [the workers] to accept the terms of the university’s offers without the benefit of any more negotiations,” Fitzpatrick said.</p>\n<p>Fitzpatrick, who represents 1,040 people in UPTE and voices their concerns to UC administration, has spent the past year and a half traveling to various UC campuses to bargain for workers’ conditions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“Students usually think of custodian staff or groundskeepers as ‘ghost people.’ They don’t want to see them, they just want to see the product of their work.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>UCSB workers are among the lowest paid in the system, despite the high cost of living associated with the Santa Barbara area, Fitzpatrick said.</p>\n<p>“Nobody is asking for an outrageous paycheck. We have a couple of titles here where the potential pay is 52 percent lower than the UC Davis campus for the same job titles. We are demanding an explanation of why that would be fair to us, why we are among the lowest paid campuses.”</p>\n<p>For Esther Ramirez, a senior custodian in the Santa Catalina Residence Hall for the past 15 years, the future of UC workers’ conditions remains unclear.</p>\n<p>“It’s the second strike; I don’t know what is next,” Ramirez said. “It’s hard because I’m a single mom, and my family of three needs to take other jobs to support the family.”</p>\n<p>According to a UC worker who asked to remain anonymous, UC employees are often considered invisible.</p>\n<p>“Students usually think of custodian staff or groundskeepers as ‘ghost people.’ They don’t want to see them, they just want to see the product of their work.”</p>\n<p>Dozens of UC Santa Barbara students, as well as several professors, were among the workers on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Shelsea Sanchez, a second-year political science major and student worker in the dining commons, said she felt the need to support her coworkers in the demonstration.</p>\n<p>“I see and interact with these workers on a daily basis and see how the UC is super exploitative when it comes to working conditions,” she said.</p>\n<p>“I have to use my voice as a student to come out and represent those people who can’t talk for themselves.”</p>\n<p>Sanchez is hopeful more students will gather for the protests on Wednesday and Thursday, adamant that students have a unique platform to advocate for reform.</p>\n<p>”Everybody here loves working at their jobs and would love to stay here. But if the UC can’t make it affordable to where we can’t afford to work at a UC and live in the Santa Barbara area, a lot of people aren’t able to stay with us,” Fitzpatrick said.</p>\n<p>“We would love to come to terms with a fair contract and get back to work without this distraction.”</p>\n<p>Further <em>Nexus</em> coverage for the strike can be viewed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/1054710350061301763\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

He was hired by UCSB in July after the previous director left following a series of controversies.</p>\n<p>The RCSGD experienced an upset during Fall Quarter 2017 when the center split from its umbrella organization, the Women, Gender &amp; Sexual Equity Department (WGSE), after its associate director Ale Muro was fired and escorted out of the building by police.</p>\n<p>RCSGD student staffers then presented a list of demands to the university, contending that they should be allowed their own autonomy in the form of a dedicated center as well an increase in funding, among other points.</p>\n<p>“I hope the school, in choosing the new director, really understood our concerns that we had the last time around, and really brought those to the hiring process this year to make sure that it won’t happen again,” said Associated Students Internal Vice President Steven Ho, who as a senator authored a resolution last year calling for the resignation of the previous director.</p>\n<p>Hikaru Ezra Mernin, who was the primary author of the demands, said the center is still suffering from a lack of trust between queer students and the RCSGD last year.</p>\n<p>“At the beginning of last year, we had several hundred [visitors]. That dropped to 50 when we had a staffing collapse, and now we have a couple dozen a day… we don’t see a lot of foot traffic,” Mernin said.</p>\n<p>Even within the center, student organizations and student staffer-led projects “fell apart” because students had to focus instead on keeping the center afloat.</p>\n<p>Mernin listed the Emerging Leadership Institute, a retreat for emerging queer leaders to foster leadership capabilities, and Society for Accessible and Safe Spaces (SASS), a trans-focused social organization, as two casualties of last year.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to get back on track now, but it’s very much a period of healing and rebuilding for our community,” they said.</p>\n<p>Mernin said they hope that Leets’s presence brings a security to the center that would allow the RCSGD to build itself back up.</p>\n<p>Leets himself came into his position fully aware of last year’s strife and wants to work with students to make amends.</p>\n<p>“If there are students who have ideas about things that the RCSGD should be doing, or ways that we can rebuild trust or mend relationships that may have been harmed or broken last year, I would love to hear from those folks,” he said.</p>\n<p>Leets specializes in LGBTQ advocacy in higher education and has had stints at PSU and Penn State University working to make sure that LGBTQ students do not face barriers at universities due to their identity.</p>\n<p>At PSU, he worked to implement a new building code that required all new and majorly renovated buildings to host all-gender, multi-stall restrooms. Leets also highlighted his efforts to make it easier for students at PSU to be recognized by their preferred names.</p>\n<p>“[We made it] so those students who don’t want to interface with their legal name don’t have to,” he said.</p>\n<p>At UCSB, Leets is working on a similar initiative that would allow students to input their own pronouns in the university system. It would then be visible on course rosters and other university databases, allowing for students to be addressed with their proper pronouns by faculty and administrators.</p>\n<p>Although there is no set timeline for its implementation yet, Leets anticipates the changes to hit campus during this academic year.</p>\n<p>There are high expectations in place for Leets as he works to return the center to the safe haven it originally was for queer students.</p>\n<p>“I came to UCSB because of the vibrancy and the cohesiveness of the queer community on campus, and very little of what I saw coming in is left,” Mernin said.</p>\n<p>Mernin says students expect the center to be more open to student input in the future and increase outreach to previously underserved communities, listing “black students, undocumented students, disabled students, lesbian students, students of faith, ACE and ARO students and intersex students.” They also want to make resources available for faculty members and graduate students.</p>\n<p>Leets seems interested in doing exactly that.</p>\n<p>“I’m just excited to continue on the legacy of other folks, particularly student activists and advocates who have done work in the past,” Leets said. “The center really has a rich legacy and LGBTQ students have been advocating on campus since the 50s, so I am just excited to be here and just continue the work that others have started.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
