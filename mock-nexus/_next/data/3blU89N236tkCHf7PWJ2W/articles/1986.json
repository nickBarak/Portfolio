The food bank will return to its permanent location on the third floor once maintenance is completed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pinedo, who took over as interim coordinator in late June, said the food bank had actually utilized its current second-floor temporary space in previous years before it moved to the third-floor location. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He noted that there has been a positive response to the new location from the food bank’s student workers despite the fact that the new location lacks refrigerators and freezers. Pinedo explained that they were “working on getting a freezer” so the bank can offer frozen food items. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Students] like the location, they like the fresh and new layout, they like the view and they like the natural light in the area,” Pinedo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Pinedo’s first acts as interim manager was coordinating the food bank’s move from the third floor to the second, which took place over four days starting on Aug. 22. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were doing an entire move in a very short period of time, and we were working in cooperation with the UCen and with students at the food bank and with student coordinators as well,” Pinedo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pinedo said he hopes to make changes to the food bank while it is in its new location before it moves back to the third floor of the UCen, although he did not note any specifics. Any proposed changes also have to be discussed with the food bank’s student coordinators and student staff before any concrete plans can be made, he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pinedo will be working with students and student coordinators on outreach during Fall Quarter in order to make more students aware of the services that the food bank has to offer. He also plans to forge partnerships with other campus organizations that have previously expressed interest in working with the food bank, in order to reach a wider range of students who might not be aware of what the food bank has to offer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Oftentimes, different departments on campus have some sort of interest in partnering with us because it will be mutually beneficial,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you look at that and the number of students we’re serving, it tells me that students are benefitting from this,” Pinedo added, referencing the food bank’s distribution numbers. During the 2017-2018 school year, the food bank distributed 39,182 pounds of food that fed 3,282 students or 13.1% of UCSB students, according to an infographic distributed by the food bank. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, students visited the food bank 52,744 times between the summer of 2017 to Spring Quarter 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Basic needs, such as food insecurity, need to be at the forefront of our thinking as far as students’ well-being. If they don’t have food, a place to live and basic necessities, it will interfere or interrupt their academic career,” he said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Hayes then continued his shooting spree issuing two more bullets to Smith’s wife, Racquel, right leg.</p>\n<p>In a senseless act of misunderstanding, police rushed to the scene to find the former NFL player fatally wounded and his spouse in critical condition.</p>\n<p>While the alleged shooter Hayes was taken into custody and questioned for further investigation, there is no doubt this inhumane action is an unfortunate one. A remorseful dispute that led to bloodshed, the city of New Orleans grieves the loss of a local father, athlete, and hometown hero in Will Smith.</p>\n<p>William Raymond Smith III’s contributions to the Crescent City have been steady since his first day in a New Orleans uniform. As the 18<sup>th</sup> overall selection in the first round of the 2004 NFL Draft, Head Coach Sean Payton had high hopes for the 6-3 defensive end to develop into one of the elite rookies of his class.</p>\n<p>Just trailing AP Defensive Rookie of the Year and eventual teammate Jonathan Vilma, Smith let his capabilities speak for itself recording 59 tackles, 7.5 sacks, and a team-high six fumbles in his first year on the defensive line.</p>\n<p>Overcoming the painful aftereffects of Hurricane Katrina, Smith’s leadership in the trenches also permeated through the needy streets of New Orleans. As a captain on the Saint’s defensive front and a community leader, Smith helped revitalized a discouraged New Orleans’ fan base, proving that they were a spirited team and city that could fall and get right back up.</p>\n<p>A core part in the Saint’s 13-3 record and Super bowl XLIV run in 2009, Smith’s presence was essential in providing a pulse for his socially stricken Louisiana team.</p>\n<p>This sense spirit will be one of many characteristics missed with the tragic passing of the 34-year old defensive end. An individual who inspired progress both on and off the field, Smith brought a vital resurgence of pride in his New Orleans neighborhood.</p>\n<p>While this swelling issue of professional athlete’s lives being cut short, Smith’s unethical death and other fellow athletes that have fallen like Sean Taylor, Chris Henry, and Brian McNair serve a purpose in showcasing the delicateness of this present life.</p>\n<p>While the presence of Will Smith fades into the distance, his memory and passion on and off the field remain intact.</p>\n<p>Smith and his wife Racquel have three children: Winter Chase Smith, William J. Smith, and Lisa Mya Smith.</p>\n<p>It was recently revealed through the Saints twitter page that Smith was unanimously voted to be inducted into the Saints Hall of Fame at a later time this year with the revelation coming on May 17th.

When you have Tom Brady and Bill Belichick, though, you’re great no matter what year it is.<br>\nAll the fuss about Deflategate hasn’t slowed New England down one bit, and the Tom Brady Revenge Tour is in full effect. The old man is third in QB rating, first in yards per game and has his team leading the NFL in point differential (49). Did I mention he’s a two-time MVP, three-time Super Bowl MVP and four-time champ that shows no Peyton Manning-like signs of slowing down?<br>\nThe receiving corps of Rob Gronkowski, Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola has gotten the job done, while solid production from shifty running back Dion Lewis has kept the Patriots offense in full throttle.

They have some issues to work out on defense, but we’ll have to wait and see if they can separate themselves from the Panthers in the only division that has two 4-0 teams.<br>\nLuckily for Atlanta, they have one of the easiest remaining schedules in the league, meaning they have a great shot at challenging Green Bay for the No. 1 seed in the NFC.</p>\n<p><strong>#5 Denver Broncos</strong><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"110977107\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65101\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64688\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/nfl/broncos/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?fit=1280%2C744&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,744\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Broncos\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?fit=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?fit=888%2C516&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignright  wp-image-64688\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?resize=157%2C91\" alt=\"Broncos\" width=\"157\" height=\"91\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?resize=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 157px) 100vw, 157px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><br>\nIf there’s one piece of advice 39-year-old Peyton Manning would give to Tom Brady right now, it’s this: Enjoy being 38. The decline of Mr. NFL Record Book has been excruciatingly noticeable this year yet, somehow, the Broncos are 4-0.<br>\nDenver’s defense has saved it on more than one occasion, but Peyton has gotten the job done when he’s needed to, most notably in a comeback win over the Chiefs in which he threw the game-tying touchdown with little time remaining.<br>\nStill, Peyton currently ranks 30th in the league in quarterback rating at 80.8, completing just 63.6 percent of passes while throwing a pick in all four games.<br>\nThe running game hasn’t done much to help either. C.J. Anderson doesn’t look like the game-changing force he was in the later parts of 2014, and other than a 72-yard TD scamper last week — Ronnie Hillman still has much to prove.<br>\nDefense and Manning’s legendary track record keep the Broncos in the conversation for Super Bowl contenders for now, but we’ll see how long that lasts.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2072591840\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65101\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64767\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-22/nfl-round-up-week-2-review/panthers/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png?fit=1280%2C696&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,696\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"panthers\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png?fit=250%2C136&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png?fit=888%2C483&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-64767 alignleft\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png?resize=153%2C83\" alt=\"panthers\" width=\"153\" height=\"83\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png?resize=250%2C136&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png?resize=1024%2C557&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 153px) 100vw, 153px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>#6 Carolina Panthers</strong><br>\nThere were two things we kept hearing about the Panthers offense coming into the season: their lack of depth at receiver and Jonathan Stewart’s new role as the lead back. The receiving corps still isn’t that good and Stewart has been disappointing to say the least, yet Cam Newton has still managed to keep his team right there alongside Atlanta atop the NFC South.<br>\nIt might just be a matter of time before the Panthers show their true colors, as it seems pretty clear Cam isn’t ready to make a deep playoff run until he’s got a little more experience and a lot more help, but for now, Carolina can bask in its exciting potential.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
