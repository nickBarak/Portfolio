Yang said.</p>\n<p>“With tragedy comes the time to stand strong against the fear and bigotry and stand up for kindness, compassion and open mindedness.”</p>\n<p>Chancellor Yang represented one of the many organizations responsible for co-hosting the event alongside Santa Barbara Hillel. The event was officially titled, “Standing With Pittsburgh Against Hate.”</p>\n<p>Miri Klein, co-director of Chabad at UCSB, also spoke at the memorial and was one of the hosts of the “Mitzvah for Pittsburgh” event in the Arbor on Monday.</p>\n<p>“Love and kindness and goodness are like steel. Hate can try and destroy that, but like steel, goodness and kindness will never be able to be destroyed. And all of us coming here together is proof that love and kindness will always prevail,” she said at the vigil.</p>\n<p>Jeike Meijer, External Vice President of Local Affairs for Associated Students, closed the ceremony with a reading of the names of the 11 victims and a song in her native language.</p>\n<p>“I think that you can see how the UCSB community was impacted by how many people showed up today. How many people came, of different groups to show support and stand in solidarity. I think that shows the impact that it [the synagogue shooting] made,” Meijer said.</p>\n<p>For some students, this recent tragedy may influence how they choose to vote in the midterms next Tuesday, Lazarus said.</p>\n<p>”When public officials who are trying to fight discrimination, fight gun laws and try to create stricter regulations, it’s going to make things like this happen less often,” Lazarus said.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it’s going to eradicate it, but it’s gonna make it happen less.”</p>\n<p>At Chabad’s table in the Arbor on Monday, the organization encouraged students to write down good deeds and add them to a board that they plan on sending to the Jewish community in Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Gershon Klein explained that mitzvot, or good deeds, are a way for Jewish people to bring light to the world during times of darkness.</p>\n<p>“A mitzvah can mean different things. One of the main things it means is to be connected… we bring light from the essence of our soul outwards into the revealed world, like right here in Isla Vista,” Gershon said.</p>\n<p>One of the mitzvot Gershon performed was wrapping tefillin around the arms of male students. This particular mitzvah is specifically for men, Gershon said.</p>\n<p>“This is a mitzvah which represents being in the oneness of hashem, God, down into the world. We put it opposite the heart, on top of the head, because often, our heart and our head give us different messages. The whole idea of tefillin is to bring oneness, inside of ourselves and in the world,” Gershon said.</p>\n<p>“So in the place where the biggest friction happens, between our emotions and our mind, we want to bind it and bring oneness to it.”</p>\n<p>Daniel Caduri, an exchange student from Germany, mourned the loss of the United States as a sanctuary for Jewish people. In Europe, Caduri said, synagogues and other Jewish facilities typically have security guards.</p>\n<p>“In the U.S. it was actually quite opposite. When you go there, everything’s open, you can just enter the room because there was no fear of danger so far. So I don’t know how it will change now,” he said.</p>\n<p>“I hope that America will [still] remain a safe place.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

misuse of the scooters. <em>Sicheng Weng / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCPD has taken a “hands off” approach to the regulation of scooters on campus so far, despite requests for them to “heavily impound” the scooters, according to Matt Bowman, UCPD Acting Lieutenant, who spoke at Tuesday’s I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting.</p>\n<p>The scooters are currently categorized under the title of motor vehicles, according to Bowman, who says a citation for riding a Bird on campus could cost $250.</p>\n<p>Bowman says that officers are doing “limited enforcement” of scooters and responding on a complaint basis.</p>\n<p>Despite this, students have ridden the scooters on campus with little to no consequences.</p>\n<p>To better regulate these policies, UCSB formed a committee which includes several university organizations such as Associated Students, UCPD and Transportation and Parking Services among others, according to Jennifer Lofthus, UCSB’s policy coordinator and deputy ADA compliance officer.</p>\n<p>The Committee is considering geofencing as one form of regulation, which would shut off scooters once they pass a certain geographical location, said Associate Dean of Students Don Lubach at the Graduate Student Association meeting Tuesday evening.</p>\n<p>In UCSB’s case, this could be Pardall Tunnel, Lubach said.</p>\n<p>At the I.V. CSD meeting on Oct. 9, Bird City Launcher Benjamin Jacobs discussed Bird’s plans to institute a “no-ride zone” for campus on the Bird app.</p>\n<p>“People will… get a notification that they’re entering a no-ride zone which we can tag based on [the university’s] requirements,” Jacobs said.</p>\n<p>The company currently does not have plans to throttle the scooters entering campus.</p>\n<p>Bird also plans to hire members of the I.V. community as “bird sweepers or watchers” who would manage the removal of Bird scooters on campus as well as educating users on how to safely operate the product, Jacobs said.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD board members also expressed concern about the safety of Bird scooters in I.V., highlighting the potential for accidents and hazardous misuse of the scooters.</p>\n<p>As an example of the I.V. CSD’s worries about the scooters, I.V. CSD Director Jay Freeman pointed out that a Bird scooter had washed up onto the beach over the weekend.</p>\n<p>In response, Jacobs said the initial sign-up process on Bird’s app requires users to watch a video that explains the rules of scooter use, which includes riding only on streets, wearing a helmet and limiting the number of persons per scooter to one.</p>\n<p>Jacobs also added that safety is a “priority” for the Bird company.</p>\n<p>The company is also considering taking the scooters off streets in I.V. during periods when high alcohol consumption among residents is likely, he said. This effort would be in hopes of reducing the amount of people operating Bird scooters while intoxicated.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD said Santa Barbara County plans to set regulations regarding the use of scooters in unincorporated territory, such as I.V., in November.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Jan. 9, 2019]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Coastal Fund, the Green Initiative Fund, the Food Security Taskforce, the Healthy Campus Network and the Fund for Santa Barbara Youth Making Change Board, among others.</p>\n<p>“A recent survey showed that 48% of undergraduate students surveyed and 31% of graduate students surveyed reported experiencing food insecurity in the past year,” Margaret Klawunn, the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs, said in a speech at the farm’s groundbreaking event on West Campus.</p>\n<p>“Today we’re starting an effort that will help to reclaim food waste and create food for students who need it the most.”</p>\n<p>Maynard said the new farm will produce far more food than any of the Edible Campus Program’s current projects. However, she was not able to give an estimate on how much food that would be.</p>\n<p>“It is hard to put an exact number on how much we will produce as we are proposing an innovative approach, mother nature is not always predictable, and we haven’t started farming yet,” Maynard said in an email.</p>\n<p>The construction of the farm will go through December and the beds for the farm will be built in the winter. The Edible Campus Program will be able to start planting in the spring, Maynard said.</p>\n<p>The A.S. Department of Public Worms will be the primary manager of the farm once it is constructed.</p>\n<p>“We registered 2,697 students in the last academic year for Calfresh and now we’re creating the space for students to grow their own food through campus gardens and farms,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>The food will be picked on the farm and delivered to the pantries on the same day, according to Alex Moon, Edible Campus Program student coordinator.</p>\n<p>“Our farm is built on a garden movement that stretches back over 40 years at UCSB and even longer in Isla Vista,” Moon said in a speech at the groundbreaking event. “We are so lucky to be a part of a university which celebrates student leadership and engages students in the shared governance of our community.”</p>\n<p>“As students, we are given the rare opportunity to dream up new ideas and test them right here on campus.”</p>\n<p>Aside from the new farm, the Edible Campus Program is also working on vertical hydroponic gardens at the UCSB Recreation Center, an urban orchard at Storke Plaza and an urban agriculture educational series.</p>\n<p>“It takes many hands to make the vision for the student farm a reality,” Chancellor Yang said in a speech at the groundbreaking event. “This farm will be a vital part of our campus food initiative and also our proud sustainability practices.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Individuals from all ten UC campuses and their respective medical centers are marching in protest.</p>\n<p>Since AFSCME representatives are spread across the state, their presence at UCSB wasn’t as large as the previous workers’ strike this past May, according to Cierra Sorin, Graduate Student Association (GSA) president.</p>\n<p>“The purpose today is to send a clear message about consciousness and awareness, and to spread our voices about what we want the university to know,” said Juan Donato, head groundskeeper at UCSB and AFSCME strike organizer.</p>\n<p>Employees across UCSB showed their support for the strike throughout the week.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“We demand their labor and then demean them for that kind of labor. And it’s really hypocritical and really elitist.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jay Stemmle, Student Academic Skills Specialist for Campus Learning Assistant Services (CLAS), spoke during the rally on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>“This is what my boss wrote to me yesterday: ‘Jay, not showing up for your scheduled shift is not protected speech… If you fail to report to work, it will be considered insubordination/serious misconduct, and your actions will be subject to discipline.’”</p>\n<p>Because of this, she decided to further research the rights of the employees who are on strike.</p>\n<p>She found that as long an an employee’s contract does not explicitly condemn participating in solidarity strikes, then striking is within their legal right, according to SCIU vs. Fresno In Home Supportive Services Authority from 2015.</p>\n<p>Stemmle told the crowd about this decision, hoping to educate UCSB employees who were unaware of their rights.</p>\n<p>“If [there are] other people in that situation, I want us to be able to find each other, strategize, talk to each other, get each other the help we need,” she said.</p>\n<p>Cathy Murillo, mayor of Santa Barbara, spoke at the rally on Wednesday afternoon in support of AFSCME’s action against UCSB.</p>\n<p>Murillo emphasized her personal connection to the strike as she spoke — her grandmother worked in the garment district in Los Angeles and was an organizer for the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union.</p>\n<p>“You deserve a salary that respects the hard work that you do. I’ll send some little fairy-vibes up to the Regents, for them to look at the good people here, and give you a good contract, the contract you deserve. I’m here for you today, folks,” she said.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"84533\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/afscme-protests-ucs-lack-of-action-during-second-day-of-strike-hundreds-show-up-in-support/screen-shot-2018-10-25-at-12-13-09-am-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?fit=1916%2C1267&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1916,1267\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2018-10-25 at 12.13.09 AM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?fit=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?fit=888%2C587&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84533\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?resize=888%2C587\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"587\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?w=1916&amp;ssl=1 1916w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?resize=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?resize=768%2C508&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?resize=1024%2C677&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?resize=980%2C647&amp;ssl=1 980w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>Numerous student groups showed up to support the workers during the strike.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen five or six teaching assistants in my department, including some who are holding sections right now. I’ve seen a couple of our professors bring their classes out,” Sorin said.</p>\n<p>One of these TAs was Amanda Rodriguez, a second-year graduate student studying sociology with an emphasis in feminist studies. She brought her students to the rally on Wednesday to observe the strikers and ask questions.</p>\n<p>“As a GSA member, the GSA executive board stands firmly behind AFSCME, and as a United Auto Workers (UAW) member I stand firmly behind them, and UC needs to know we’re watching, we care, and we’re willing to mobilize on [AFSCME’s] behalf,” Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>The issue of workers’ rights carries personal significance for many students who marched on Tuesday and Wednesday, including Frances Olague, a third-year psychology major.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been coming to these ever since I was a little kid because my mom works for UC Berkeley. It’s really close to home since my mom is a UC worker, and I feel like with their petitions and everything, how it goes through affects my life as well,” Olague said.</p>\n<p>Despite the strong student support present throughout the strike, some students were still in opposition. Their criticism is often centered around the workers’ lack of higher education or seemingly self-chosen job choice.</p>\n<p>“There was definitely people that didn’t seem too happy with [the strike], but I was happy to be out here, and I was happy to see as many students as there was out here as well,” said June Mihalich, a sociology major in her last quarter.</p>\n<p>One post on UCSB’s Free &amp; For Sale group on Facebook mentioned a UCSB student telling the demonstrators to be quiet because she had midterms and yelling at them to “fuck off.”</p>\n<p>Dozens of commenters argued whether the girl’s reactions were valid.</p>\n<p>“We demand our McDonald’s so fast, but we shame those workers when they ask to at least be able to get a living wage. We demand their labor and then demean them for that kind of labor. And it’s really hypocritical and really elitist to say that,” Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>Leaders of the strike emphasized that it takes the combined action of students, employees and workers to make an impact that UCSB administrators cannot ignore.</p>\n<p>“As union workers, let’s stick together. Together, we will make this work, together we will win,” Donato said.</p>\n<p>The AFSCME strike will continue on Thursday, Oct. 25 until 6 p.m. at Storke Tower.</p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.1 of the Oct. 25 print edition of the</i> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
