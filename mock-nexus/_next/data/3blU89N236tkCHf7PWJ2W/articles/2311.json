Lu spent much of his time volunteering, including through beach clean-ups and music lessons in the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An avid musician, Lu played the french horn in the Woodbridge High School marching band in Irvine, California. Lu also liked to play piano, baseball and work out with friends, often motivating them to exercise harder. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alyssa Sanjongio became friends with Lu when the two played the french horn in their middle and high school band. Friends would often call Lu the “ride guy” because he was always willing to give someone a ride in his car if they needed to go somewhere. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanjongio described Lu as “iconic” and well-liked, reflecting on when Lu was crowned king of the Winter Formal and the multiple times Lu would fall asleep in class in high school.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She says that Lu’s death has brought many of their high school friends together in a way only Lu could.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though it’s really horrible, it’s still like this new sense of connection and strength among all the people that he touched in his life, which is really amazing,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of Lu’s friends from high school, including Sanjongio, also attended UCSB. Nathan Ng, a high school and college friend, echoed Sanjongio’s sentiments about Lu, adding that Lu approached everyone with a kindness and humility that is hard to find.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He went out of his way to help people, whether it was people in his normal social group or just people in general. He was very open to seeing how everyone was doing and I greatly respect that,” Ng said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lu was a present and constant part of his friends’ lives, said Eric Kim, a longtime friend of Lu’s and one of his roommates in Santa Cruz Residence Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve known him for a long time, [and] I always expect his presence,” Kim said. “I’ve gotten used to him.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lu was also enjoying his time at UCSB, Kim said, adding that Lu was excited to attend the university last summer.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It exceeded expectations when he got here, he was really having a good time, even when he had a lot of work or classes,” Kim said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malcolm Tsay met Lu in middle school and said Lu was “like a brother” to him.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He was just the most helpful person ever,” Tsay said. “He always put other people first. You could talk to him about anything [and] he opened up his heart to everyone.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tsay set up a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/7u33cn-james-lus-funeral-fund\">GoFundMe</a> for Lu’s funeral and has raised over $13,000 so far. He said he wanted to give something back to Lu and help out his family.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lu was a leader, Tsay said, and someone he could look to for guidance, whether it be for music or life advice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This year, I’m drum major of the marching band, and I wouldn’t have those leadership skills without the interactions I’ve shared with James and the advice he’s given me throughout the years,” Tsay said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another band friend, Aziz Hamza, said he continued to stay in contact with Lu at UCSB to see how he was adjusting to college life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hamza described Lu as dedicated and having a “relaxed presence.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He’d always be laughing, like, whatever conversation he would be having, it would be something humorous,” Hamza said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of Lu’s friends noted that Lu was on his way to teach piano to children on the day he died.

id=\"caption-attachment-82091\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Coalition for a Better UC presented to A.S. their campaign to extend Cal Grant aid to summer sessions, claiming it is a small step in the efforts to keep students from marginalized backgrounds in school. <em>Will Tran /Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Coalition for a Better UC launched a campaign in the fall of 2017 focused on passing </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assembly Bill 3153</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which will extend financial aid from Cal Grant into summer sessions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campaign is expected to end in June of 2018 when the State Assembly will vote on the bill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The coalition is requesting that the funding for this aid increase come from Governor Jerry Brown’s “Rainy Day Fund.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brown’s fund, which will amount to  $13.5 billion by the summer of 2019 avoids raising taxes for the extended aid, according to Eddy Chikukwa the president and founder of the Coalition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California’s Office of the President (UCOP) estimated the total cost of summer tuition for all the UCs, Cal States and community colleges would be $148 million a year, which is 1 percent of Brown’s Rainy Day Fund.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa, a third-year political science and philosophy double major, said he was inspired to start this campaign when he began working for the UC Santa Barbara Office of Financial Aid earlier last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board of Directors for the Cal State campuses are meeting in April to discuss and potentially approve the Bill.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The board] saying they’ll legitimize it, means 23 Cal States and the 450,000 students they represent said they’re [in support of] this. It’s a really big deal for negotiating leverage with legislators,” Chikukwa said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Chikukwa, the coalition organizers alongside the University of California Student Association (UCSA) and the UC Regents will be going to Sacramento from March 24 to March 26 to present the bill to state legislators and ask for support. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students (A.S.) passed a resolution on March 7 supporting this campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution was presented by Mayela Morales, legislative outreach director for the Coalition, and Justice Dumlao, a third-year global studies major and communication director for the Coalition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Irvine’s A.S. passed their own resolution on Feb. 15 sponsoring the Coalition’s campaign, and UC Santa Cruz, UC Riverside and UC Merced are among others that are discussing their involvement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The most telling signs that someone is going to graduate [in four years] is income level,” Director of Student Outreach for the Coalition, Chadwyck Moore said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a study done by the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) in 2015, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California will see a decrease of 1.1 million college graduates by 2030 due to lack of financial aid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa and the rest of the Coalition began promoting the idea of extending the Cal Grant into summer sessions in order to increase the amount of students that graduate out of UC’s and Cal States within four years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The Coalition’s] whole motive was to educate people first, and then build legislative support,” said Chikukwa.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make the bill more appealing to legislators, the Coalition is asking students to sign a petition in support of it, according to Moore,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a fourth-year political science major.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to show [the legislators] that students are behind this and are watching every step of the way,” Chikukwa said.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cal Grant is expected to include undocumented students as well as offer more financial aid to students from middle income families, added Chikukwa. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Coalition’s platform that was presented to the A.S. claims that the campaign is a small step in the efforts to keep students from marginalized backgrounds in school and to “ultimately create free higher education institutions</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We students need to take this matter into our own hands. Taking out loans.. only increases the over $1.3 trillion of student debt nationwide,” said Morales, a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fourth-year global and chicanx studies double major</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “I’m very optimistic that this bill will be approved.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article inaccurately reported that the funding will be officially coming from Governor Brown’s “Rainy Day Fund,” and has been corrected to show that the Coalition for a Better UC is recommending it come from Brown’s Fund</em>.</p><div

He explained that a student initially contacted him about the issue.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82240\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"420696172\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82231\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82240\" data-attachment-id=\"82240\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/broken-outdated-pipes-to-blame-for-ucen-smell/ucen-ceiling-collapse/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?fit=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Ucen ceiling collapse\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-82240\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse-768x1024.jpg?resize=768%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=1122%2C1496&amp;ssl=1 1122w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=840%2C1120&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?w=1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82240\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The collapsed piece of the ceiling can be seen in the photo above. <em>Courtesy of Hieu Le</em></p></div>\n<p>“It hasn’t been updated in over 50 years; we’re using a design and technology that do not meet modern efficiency standards,” Le said.</p>\n<p>There is currently no heat or air conditioning in the UCen Lobby or the Hub and the emergency generator circuit capacity needs to be expanded to include all “life safety and operational equipment,” according to the documents.</p>\n<p>Approximately $22,500 of this budget would be used to replace toilet partitions, hand dryers and other various bathroom accessories in three of the UCen bathrooms that have not been updated since 1966. These bathrooms need new water supply lines and need to be re-tiled.</p>\n<p>New “low-flow” toilets, faucets and fixtures need to be placed in the bathrooms as well, according to the documents.</p>\n<p>A total of 21 exterior doors need to be replaced and fitted with new locks. The UCen also needs to replace four of its regular elevators and one freight elevator.</p>\n<p>The sprinkler system is functional, but needs to be replaced and it is recommended that exposed sprinkler heads be concealed to prevent vandalism, according to the documents. Some of the UCen’s fire alarm control panels need to be upgraded to a campus standard networked system.</p>\n<p>“Those are the most essentially priority needs. We’ve accounted for that in the total priority costs,” Le said.</p>\n<p>Money raised by the UCen renovation project would be used to address these repairs, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“If this renovation expansion were to not happen, that operation and maintenance fee over a span of 30 years is going to accumulate to $40 to $45 million that’s spent into a current facility right now that is deteriorating and has declining value,” he said.</p>\n<p>Currently, students are paying approximately $40 a quarter in student fees to the UCen. If students <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-18/ucen-project-will-be-on-a-s-elections-ballot/\">vote</a> to pass the UCen renovation project at the end of April, student fees will increase by $20.40 until 2022, and to $96.06 until 2052.</p>\n<p>These numbers will rise due to inflation, according to documents obtained by the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Design fees, internal feels, insurance, escalation and contingency fees are not included in the budget estimate.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the April 5 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Update: This article was updated to include a Thursday morning picture of a sewer leak in a water closet. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
