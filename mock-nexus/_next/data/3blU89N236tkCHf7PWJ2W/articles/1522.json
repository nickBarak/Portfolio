Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB was able to hold on for a tie in a tough away game at Northridge on thursday. This game gave the Gauchos their first point of the conference season and bumped them up two places in the Big West to their current seventh place standing. CSU Northridge fell to sixth place in the standings as a result of the tie and are still looking for their first conference win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos came out with a much more offensively aggressive mindset than in their last two losses, and it paid off with a goal by freshman Christine Maurer in the 14th minute. She knocked in a perfect corner kick by midfielder Chace Schornstein to the near post, and with that they had their first lead in two games. Maurer has been on a tear for the Gauchos recently, having scored three goals in the last three games leading up to this one, and this goal put her at five for the season. That sort of offensive output from the midfield is rare, and her continued improvement has been one of the biggest positives for the team this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rest of the first half was mostly back and forth, however the Gauchos were able to continue to attack and get three shots on goal the remainder of the period, two of those courtesy of Maurer.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half belonged to Northridge however, as a complete shift of momentum ensued when the teams came out of the locker room. CSUN got five shots off in the first 15 minutes of play, and they eventually broke through with a goal in the 60’ minute. It was another goal by a freshman, however this time it was the Matadors’ Amy Aquino who netted it after her teammate Cynthia Sanchez beat the Gauchos goalie in a one on one situation in the box.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSUN continued to apply pressure on UCSB just how the Gauchos were able to do to them in the first half after their goal, yet they couldn’t create any goals off their four scoring opportunities which led the game to overtime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a repeat of the beginning of the game, the Gauchos worked to impose themselves on the Matadors defense during the first overtime period. Shots by both Colby Parker and Madeline Gibson didn’t find their marks however, leading to a second period of overtime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both teams had their share of opportunities in double overtime, yet UCSB almost came out with the victory in the final minute of play when junior midfielder Mallory Hromatko’s shot was saved by the goalie Jovani Mccaskill. The game ended in a tie, a result that the Gauchos can certainly live with. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking forward to UCSB’s next matchup against Hawaii, the Gauchos have a chance to make an even higher ascent up the rankings. Although they’ve lost two games already, fouth place is only one victory away and it’s up to UCSB to beat the second to last place team in the conference to get there.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

You hope you can do all of that in one game.”</p>\n<p>The annual season-opening matchup, which has historically been dominated by UCSB, is the Gauchos’ only tune-up game before a hosting a difficult early-season challenge against Stanford next Friday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“All the teams that have done well in the past at UCSB have gone out in this Westmont game and have won by six or seven goals, so obviously we’re looking to send a message in this game to our future opponents,” senior defender Duncan Backus said. “We’re just looking to do all the right things on the field so we can get a good result and send a message to the rest of the country that we’re here to play this year.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is coming off its second straight successful campaign in 2014 in which it finished the regular season with a record of 10-7-3 overall and 6-2-2 in conference, good enough to secure a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the Big West Tournament. Unfortunately, for the second straight year, the Gauchos fell by a final score of 3-2 in the Big West Tournament Semifinals, this time in a heartbreaker to UC Irvine, ending their hopes of making a run in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Ready to put last year behind them, the Gauchos are looking at this weekend as a welcome fresh start.</p>\n<p>“In terms of the last couple years, to be frank, it wasn’t good enough. What’s expected at UCSB is a lot better than what we’ve shown.” Backus said. “We’re looking to put this program back to where it needs to be and that’s at the top of the country. Everyone’s taken great pride in the shirt and as long as we sustain that excitement, with the level of talent that we have here, I don’t see a lot of teams being able to compete with us.”</p>\n<p>A big factor playing in UCSB’s favor this year will be the experience of its core group. Last year, the Gauchos saw a high number of underclassmen taking up a large share of the minutes on the field. While it may not have been an ideal situation at the time, the benefits from having key players receive all that play time should be clear once the season begins.</p>\n<p>“The last two years we’ve played a lot of young players, so now we see the benefit of seeing guys who have played 55-60 college games,” Vom Steeg said. “We’ll certainly know more about ourselves on Saturday but I like where we are right now and I like the attitude that we have on this team.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps the three most crucial of the “young players” from the last two seasons are now juniors in forward Nick DePuy, left back Ismaila Jome and midfielder Drew Murphy. DePuy made the move to forward last season and led the team with 10 goals, including six game-winners, making national headlines and earning himself the Big West Offensive Player of the Year award.</p>\n<p>Jome and Murphy both shared the team lead with five assists apiece, helping earn them a spot alongside DePuy on this year’s Preseason All-Conference Team. UCSB also received seven out of eight first-place votes in the preseason coaches poll to win the Big West North Division for the third straight year.</p>\n<p>“We’re in good shape in terms of having options,” Vom Steeg said. “Nick will be a center point of our attack, but unlike last year where if he scored we usually won and if he didn’t score we usually didn’t win, we’re going to have lots of different scoring options.”</p>\n<p>Another issue which plagued Santa Barbara all last season was the impact of injuries on the team’s depth, particularly in the midfield. Halfway through the conference season, Vom Steeg was even forced to put sophomore midfielder Andy Perez, who had been redshirting the entire season, into the starting lineup.</p>\n<p>However, luck has been on the Gauchos’ side thus far in the preseason in terms of their health.</p>\n<p>“I think the question mark is going to be what we do out of midfield. I think we have some flexibility,” Vom Steeg said. “Coming out of training camp we have one injury, so we have 28 players available.

The Gauchos also added five transfers, helping to bolster their depth heading into their 2015 campaign which begins in August.</p>\n<p>“We feel good about the class.  It’s a highly rated class,” Vom Steeg said. “Unfortunately, we just don’t always know if a player is really coming until they actually show up on the first day of practice.”</p>\n<p>Of the six freshmen, Vom Steeg has already named several players who are expected to make an instant impact on the pitch, including his son, goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg, forward Geoffrey Acheampong and defender Sam Strong.</p>\n<p>The younger Vom Steeg out of San Marcos High School has gotten a head start on the college game, having already enrolled at UCSB for the spring quarter and participating in the team’s offseason. While playing for his club, Real So Cal, Vom Steeg has already built an impressive résumé heading into his freshman year.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara native has played for the U.S. Men’s National Team since the U-14 level, most recently protecting the net at the U-18 level in a 5-1 win over Urawa back in February. Vom Steeg has earned recognition not only locally, but nationally, being ranked a four-star recruit, the No. 2 goalkeeping prospect in the nation and the No. 23 player overall by Top Drawer Soccer.</p>\n<p>Joining the goalkeeper with an early start at UCSB is his former teammate at both San Marcos High School and Real So Cal in defender Sam Strong. Another recent call-up to the USMNT U-23 squad, Strong was named a three-star recruit by Top Drawer Soccer.</p>\n<p>“It’s nice to be able to have players who are going to be able to help you in the fall come into school early,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>A multi-talented defender, Strong has shown an ability to play any position in the back four and is a proven weapon on the offensive side as well. He put in a total of six goals for his U-18 club team in his final season, good for second-best on a team that made the playoffs.</p>\n<p>“Any time you have a freshman that you think is going to start for you, then that’s going to be a pretty good freshman,” Vom Steeg said. “[Sam and Justin] are quality players that you expect to help the program and contribute right away.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive side, Geoffrey Acheampong will be a creator to watch for coming down the wing. Vom Steeg has already named the left-footed forward out of Cate School in Carpinteria a likely starter for the upcoming season, thanks in part to his play for Santa Barbara Soccer Club. As SBSC’s captain, Acheampong helped lead his team to a US Youth Soccer Cup Championship. College Soccer news has ranked him as high as No. 23 nationally in his class.</p>\n<p>Rounding out the freshman class are midfielder Evan Schwartz from Corona Del Mar High School in Newport Beach, forward Cody Gibson from Bellevue High School in Washington and midfielder Kostadin Moni out of Forest Hills Eastern High School in Illinois.</p>\n<p>Onto the transfers, sophomore Ahinga Selemani is another member of the USMNT  at the U-20 level that should provide an instant punch for the Gauchos on the offensive side. The 5’8”, 170-pound forward was named the “most high-profile transfer” of the offseason by Top Drawer Soccer, coming off a strong freshman season for Michigan that earned him a spot on the Big Ten All-Conference Freshman Team.</p>\n<p>“What we’re looking for in transfers is their experience and their ability to contribute right away,” Vom Steeg said. “The transfer players who we’ve got committed are players who we feel could step in from both a maturity standpoint and a physical standpoint and not take nine or 10 games to get up to speed at the Division I level.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore midfielder and forward Kevin Feucht, originally from Germany, will be making the move over from the University of Charleston where he was a key player in the Golden Eagles’ run to the Division II National Championship Game. The German-born Feucht put in seven goals to go along with three assists in his freshman season.</p>\n<p>The final three additions to the team include sophomore defender Adedapo Adeniyi out of the University of Mobile, midfielder Seo-In Kim from Duke and redshirt sophomore Kevin Armstrong from New Mexico.</p>\n<p>A notable departure from the team that will leave big shoes to fill at right back is graduated senior Kevin Garcia-Lopez.</p>\n<p>Also leaving the team is sophomore forward Ludwig Ahl, a key offensive contributor last season who notched four goals and four assists to give him 12 total points, good for second on the team.</p>\n<p>Despite finishing in first place, the Gauchos’ 2014 season was one that was plagued by injuries. UCSB will hope that its improved depth will allow it to make it through the 2015 season with as few bumps in the road as possible.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will begin their next season against national powerhouse Stanford in August.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 14, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The sophomore scored six goals in the Gauchos’ final four games to give him a team-high of 10 on the year. That stretch included consecutive braces on the road against Cal Poly and Sacramento State to give UCSB its only two conference road wins of the year.</p>\n<p>“You can’t underestimate or under-emphasize the fact that every time we’ve needed a goal, Nick scored it,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s an amazing stretch. We’ve won six conference games and Nick’s got the game-winner in five of them. We’re just hoping it becomes six out of seven.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos are currently the hottest they’ve been all year, the Anteaters could not be in a more different position. UCI, which at one point was the No. 3 team in the nation, has lost four of its last six games, being outscored 9-4 during that stretch.</p>\n<p>“I like the fact that we’re playing better and we’ve got good momentum,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s kind of interesting that it’s been flipped a little bit. They’re coming in this game after having lost four out of five, and we’ve gone 4-0-1. At least in that way I feel better about this game.”</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams played at Harder Stadium over a month ago, the Gauchos came away on top in miraculous fashion with DePuy scoring from 35-yards out with under a minute remaining, giving his team a 1-0 win. The loss was Irvine’s first of the season after starting out an outstanding 9-0-2.</p>\n<p>“I think we have to play better in this game to win. When I look at that game, I thought they controlled a lot of the first half and I thought that they had some really good opportunities in the second half to win that game,” Vom Steeg said. “We dodged some bullets in that first game, so we can’t expect to give up those same opportunities the second go around and not be punished for them.”</p>\n<p>The Anteaters are powered on offense by Eduardo Calzada, who has team-highs in goals (7), assists (4), and points (18).</p>\n<p>For UCSB, the most important factor heading into this game could be the fact that it is playing at home, where it owns a record of 7-1-2 this year. After going winless in their first three conference road games, the Gauchos returned to Harder to begin their current season-high five- game unbeaten streak. Owning the No. 1 seed also gave them a first-round bye, giving the team some much needed time off.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t have to play on Saturday so this week allowed us to give the guys a couple days off and to try to heal up a little bit,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s good for us at this point in the year to have a couple days off, especially when we’ve been playing twice a week. We should be as rested as we can be, so it should mean that we have no excuses in terms of being ready to play tomorrow night.”</p>\n<p>A win tonight would make UCSB the hosts of the Big West Championship game, which would be played this Saturday against the winner of the Semifinal between UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>The game with Irvine will kickoff at 7:00 p.m. tonight at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58144\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-12/playoff-time-big-west-semifinal-rematch/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58144\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-12/playoff-time-big-west-semifinal-rematch/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-12/playoff-time-big-west-semifinal-rematch/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-12/playoff-time-big-west-semifinal-rematch/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-12/playoff-time-big-west-semifinal-rematch/","id":1519,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1518,1517,1516],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
