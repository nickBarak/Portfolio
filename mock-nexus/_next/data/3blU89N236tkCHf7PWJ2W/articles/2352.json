Users also have the option to attach a large umbrella to the back of the chair.</p>\n<p>Beachgoers can access the chair free of charge at the Adventure Program’s Campus Point Rentals center or through the Rec Cen.</p>\n<p>Cathy Czuleger, senior associate director for programming, information technology and development for the Department of Recreation, said the Rec Cen first purchased the beach wheelchair with funding from the Adapted Recreation Program 10 years ago.</p>\n<p>The Adapted Recreation Program is a Santa Barbara organization that provides outdoor services to community members with special needs.</p>\n<p>She said when the program ended, the wheelchair became “rusty and unusable” so the Rec Cen contacted CF to fund a new chair.</p>\n<p>The Rec Cen proposed the project to CF and applied for funding during winter 2016, said Peter Min, outreach coordinator for CF.</p>\n<p>“The program ended, and the wheelchair was not maintained or easily available for use during the past 10 years,” Min said.</p>\n<p>Czuleger said she decided to write a proposal to CF requesting money to purchase a new chair and said she was happy with the organization’s “generous” funding allocation.</p>\n<p>According to Min, CF accepts proposals for research, projects and internships every quarter and critically reviews them to see if they are compatible with the organization’s mission statement, the student community and their goal to preserve the shoreline and marine life.</p>\n<p>CF receives funds from all UCSB students through a lock-in student fee every quarter. Each undergraduate student contributes $5.75 per quarter and each graduate student contributes $3.00 per quarter.</p>\n<p>CF provides over $350,000 each year to preserve UCSB’s beaches and has distributed over $3 million locally since the fall of 1999.</p>\n<p>If students wish to earn funding for their own group or organization, they can participate in CF’s restoration projects and beach clean-ups.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

historically large out-of-towner presence in I.V. for party weekends like Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p><strong>ISLA VISTA</strong></p>\n<p>According to the Associated Students’ (A.S.) Halloween website, street parking will be prohibited starting at 9 a.m. on Friday, Oct. 27, until 6 a.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 1, on the 6500, 6600 and 6700 blocks of Del Playa Drive, the 6500 block of Trigo Road and between Del Playa Drive and Trigo Road on Camino Pescadero, Camino Del Sur and El Embarcadero Road.</p>\n<p>Cars parked on the 6500 block of El Nido Road and on the 6500, 6600 and 6700 blocks of Sabado Tarde Road do not need to be moved over this time period, but roadblocks will be placed on those blocks to prevent cars from entering and exiting.</p>\n<p><strong>UCSB</strong></p>\n<p>According to the A.S. Halloween website, visitors are not allowed to park on campus.</p>\n<p>Vehicles parked on campus without a matching permit are subject to a $300 citation and towing.</p>\n<p>Students with a Night &amp; Weekend (N&amp;W) Parking Permit will be able to park on campus from 11 a.m. on Friday to 7:30 a.m. on Wednesday. Lots 22, 18, 16, 30 and 38 will be the only lots open for parking over the weekend.</p>\n<p>N&amp;W permits purchased in the fall cost $52.50 plus a $5.95 shipping charge. Permits are sold year round, but students had to apply for a parking permit by Oct. 15 to have it shipped in time for the coming weekend. Each student may only purchase one permit.</p>\n<p>The only valid permits for overnight parking — between 5 p.m. and 7:30 a.m. — are special event permits, N&amp;W, Isla Vista Access permit for Lot 22 (IVA 22) or faculty and staff permits.</p>\n<p>IVA 22 is a valid permit for Lot 22.</p>\n<p>Only 100 of these permits were available for “community members, UCSB staff, faculty, and non-resident students,” according to the Associated Students’ Halloween tip website.</p>\n<p>Last year, Transportation &amp; Parking Services offered a 50 percent discount for the N&amp;W permits prior to the Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>Nestor Covarrubias, director of Transportation &amp; Parking Services, said they decided not to renew the discount this year because they believe the permit price is already fair.</p>\n<p>“The Night and Weekend parking permit is a good value, allowing access to campus for the entire academic year,” Covarrubias said in an email. “The equivalent cost to purchase daily passes for the Halloween period alone would come out to $32.”</p>\n<p>Transportation &amp; Parking Services has sold 354 N&amp;W permits this year. The department sold 465 permits by this time last year, Covarrubias said.</p>\n<p>According to Covarrubias, Transportation &amp; Parking Services issued 95 parking citations between Oct. 28 and Oct. 30 last year. He said 94 of the citations were issued at $48, and one was issued at $238 because the vehicle was parked in front of a fire hydrant.</p>\n<p><strong>GOLETA</strong></p>\n<p>According to Valerie Kushnerov, community relations manager for the City of Goleta, between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. Friday through Sunday, street parking will be limited to residents with parking permits for the weekend. Two such parking permits were sent to each Goleta household in preparation.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 26, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Food Not Bombs is a large organization that spans the country and is a form of “franchise activism.” They believe that corporate and government priorities are skewed and allow hunger despite the abundance of food and food waste. Those interested in cooking for Sunday can email organizers at foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com or look for more information on the Food Not Bombs – Isla Vista Facebook page. The dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Nov. 2, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advertisements began running on </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pandora, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram on Oct. 10 and will remain on the sites until Oct. 31. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University spokesperson Andrea Estrada said the advertisements are funded through unrestricted gift funds, which are donations from alumni. The <em>Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-will-spend-up-to-40k-on-ads-discouraging-deltopia-crowds/\">reported</a> in February that the university spent $30,000 on advertisements for Halloween weekend last year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advertisements are one of the ways the university has tried to curb attendance during party weekends like Halloween and Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada said the campus-wide efforts build on the student-based “keep it local” initiative, a campaign that runs television and radio advertisements throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs sends letters to college students throughout California that outline regulations that could impact students if they choose to attend Halloween in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university also sends letters to local junior high and high schools urging students to not celebrate Halloween in I.V.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katya Armistead, dean of student life, said the Office of Student Life met with representatives from Associated Students and UC Isla Vista in the beginning of Fall Quarter to share the content of the advertisements and receive feedback. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Batsheva Stoll, external vice president of local affairs, said she appreciates the university’s efforts to decrease attendance in I.V. during Halloween weekend but said the advertisements are an expensive option and can provoke misunderstanding.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ads themselves can give I.V. a bad rap by making it seem like a scary hostile place when it’s our home and our community,” Stoll said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kelly Hoover, spokesperson for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s office (SBSO), the turnout for Halloween weekend has steadily decreased over the past three years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SBSO estimated that “several hundred” people were in I.V. for Halloween weekend last year, Hoover said, a significant decrease from the 13,000 partygoers that visited I.V. in 2013. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Santa Barbara Police Department (UCPD) will have about 55 officers patrolling I.V. this weekend, said Sgt. Rob Romero, UCPD spokesperson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD will also source officers from four other University of California campuses to assist in patrolling, including officers from San Diego, Riverside, Irvine and San Francisco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hoover said there will still be a strong law enforcement presence in I.V. this weekend, despite the decreased turnout in recent years. The SBSO does not release the number of officers assigned to an operation for safety reasons, Hoover said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been really pleased with what we’ve seen in the last couple of years, with students really having pride in their community and their school and wanting to keep Isla Vista safe,” Hoover said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79352\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-28/advertisements-cost-uc-santa-barbara-up-to-30k-for-halloween-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79352\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-28/advertisements-cost-uc-santa-barbara-up-to-30k-for-halloween-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-28/advertisements-cost-uc-santa-barbara-up-to-30k-for-halloween-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-28/advertisements-cost-uc-santa-barbara-up-to-30k-for-halloween-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-28/advertisements-cost-uc-santa-barbara-up-to-30k-for-halloween-weekend/","id":2350,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2349,2348,2347],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
