Senate plans to pass a resolution next Wednesday to allocate university spots and academic scholarships to the Syrian refugees displaced from their home universities.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Associated Students (A.S.) Senate plans to pass a resolution next Wednesday to allocate university spots and academic scholarships to the Syrian refugees displaced from their home universities.</p>\n<p>Senators Bianca Fernandez and Batsheva Stoll authored the resolution and presented it at the meeting on Wednesday, Jan. 18. The resolution is part of a UC-wide movement to join the Institute for International Education (IIE) Syrian Consortium for Higher Education in Crisis.</p>\n<p>So far, participating universities have collected 17,635 signatures in support of scholarships for Syrian students.</p>\n<p>The IIE Syrian Consortium is a group of international universities that have allocated admission space for Syrian students and provided them with scholarships to help them attend school while their own country remains unsafe in an ongoing war.</p>\n<p>Funded by the Clinton Foundation, the United Nations and other global organizations, the goal of the scholarship program is to help Syrian students continue their education and rebuild their country.</p>\n<p>The program also offers scholarships, leadership training and conducts research on how to improve global higher education.</p>\n<p>When refugees are forced to escape their country, the students must temporarily abandon their education. The IIC Syrian Consortium plans for these Syrian students to attend college in other countries and then return home to become leaders.</p>\n<p>If the resolution passes, UCSB would be the fourth school in the UC system to officially petition the Regents to join the IIE Syrian Consortium, alongside UC Davis, UC Irvine and UC Berkeley. Of the three, UC Davis is the only school that has already enrolled Syrian refugee students.</p>\n<p>The resolution was brought to the Senate’s attention by “Books Not Bombs,” a campaign founded in response to the Syrian refugee crisis. The goal of “Books Not Bombs” is to encourage universities to join the IIE Syria Consortium.</p>\n<p>According to the resolution, 90,000 to 110,000 Syrian students qualify for university admission “based on pre-war enrollment estimates.”</p>\n<p>American citizens would not be affected if the resolution were adopted because the student positions and financial aid would exclusively come from funding reserved for international students.</p>\n<p>Syrian students would get priority admission over other international students because of their country’s need for education.</p>\n<p>If the resolution is passed at UCSB, the UC and the program may face political backlash from conservative groups across the nation.</p>\n<p>Nawar Nameh, a third-year history of public policy and global studies double major, said he believes the Syrian students’ efforts to attend American universities could be thwarted by the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>“I’m very worried about that,” Nameh said. “They might start passing executive action that could curtail immigration completely.”</p>\n<p>The refugees are arriving in the United States through regular means of immigration, so their entry could be threatened by President Trump’s executive order, which was drafted Wednesday, to temporarily block refugees from entering the United States and suspend visas of those from Syria and six other Middle Eastern countries.</p>\n<p>“These refugees would be coming through standard immigration paths, so if these paths get shut down, then there’s no way for them to get here,” Nameh said. “Then we’re going to have to address a much bigger issue.”</p>\n<p>The resolution is currently in the A.S. External Committee, which will discuss it further in a meeting Friday. If it passes through the committee, it will be considered and voted on at the A.S. Senate meeting on Feb. 1.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Participating universities have gained 17,665 signatures in support of scholarships for Syrian students, they have not created that number of scholarships.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The new design is more simple and straightforward, and it will allow for easy navigation of the library’s database and its material.</p></div>\n<p>The UCSB Library website got a major remodel at the beginning of Winter Quarter, updating its outdated homepage with an accessible new look.</p>\n<p>It is the first redesign of the site in more than five years. The new appearance is intended to reflect elements of the UCSB Library’s physical renovation and mirror its status at a competitive research university.</p>\n<p>Marcos Aguilar, the reference and information supervisor at the library, said the transition is based on creating a new online database system and improving the availability of library materials for students and faculty.</p>\n<p>The new online database is a catalog software update that was outsourced through a software company. This update provides a simple navigational structure and reduces the number of pages required for users to find specific research materials.</p>\n<p>“The main motivation has to do with material circulation,” Aguilar said. “Right now, the catalog looks the same as it did before. The homepage is sleeker and more visually stimulating, though.”</p>\n<p>The reason for the redesign was not only to modernize the website but to make click-thru links smoother and add mobile-friendliness. The library is currently installing the catalog update and should complete it by the next school year.</p>\n<p>According to the Library’s website, the new catalog takes advantage of “increased database-driven functionality to minimize duplicate content.”</p>\n<p>The website revamp is the result of a “thoughtful review process” that involved conducting user testing, collecting survey data and website analytics over many years.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74946\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74946\" data-attachment-id=\"74946\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/library-website-gets-first-facelift-in-5-years/library-photo-courtesy-of-karen-lindell/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Library-Photo-Courtesy-of-Karen-Lindell.jpg?fit=2000%2C1071&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1071\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"library-photo-courtesy-of-karen-lindell\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Library-Photo-Courtesy-of-Karen-Lindell.jpg?fit=250%2C134&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Library-Photo-Courtesy-of-Karen-Lindell.jpg?fit=888%2C475&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74946\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Library-Photo-Courtesy-of-Karen-Lindell-1024x548.jpg?resize=888%2C475\" alt=\"The UCSB Library opened its new building in January 2016.

The original Davidson Library was built in 1954, and it was intended to be the geographical center of the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>The new building is considerably more modern and features drop-lighting, a new transfer center, expanded seating areas and a café open during daylight hours.</p>\n<p>Since the building’s reconstruction, the university has also hired staff members to push the facility into a new era of technology.  This summer, Thomas Padilla came onboard as the first ever humanities data curator in the UC system. Padilla works with humanities departments which can vary in data usage from traditional S.T.E.M. fields.</p>\n<p>New Mac computers also made their debut in the Learning Commons earlier this summer, which are now the only Mac computers available on campus for general student use.</p>\n<p>Funding for the computers came from the library’s budget, mostly made up of state money and private donations. The library also plans to use $30,000 to $40,000 from the Class of 2016 senior class gift to install additional technology.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, Jan.

students filled the UC Santa Barbara campus on Election Day 2016 in protest of president-elect Donald Trump. As the echoes of protests die down throughout the country, students are once again bristling in anticipation of a new presidency that may cause irreparable change throughout the country.</p>\n<p>Undocumented students have fallen into the center of this struggle, pinpointed by Trump’s unfavorable rhetoric regarding undocumented immigrants and President Obama’s 2012 initiative, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).</p>\n<p>The California government, the University of California and university law enforcement now attempt to provide answers in the eight days until inauguration.</p>\n<p>In late 2016, UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang signed a statement endorsed by the Association of American Universities in support of DACA. Chancellors from all 10 UC campuses, including UC President Janet Napolitano, also signed the statement.</p>\n<p>Napolitano, a trained lawyer, was the former United States Secretary of Homeland Security from 2009 to 2013. She was criticized at the beginning of her term for implementing the controversial Secure Communities program, an immigration-enforcement policy that detected undocumented immigrants via fingerprints taken by local police.</p>\n<p>In the last three years, however, she has supported the UC’s D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program for undocumented students, allocated $2.5 million per year for created undocumented student fellowships and granted UC’s Undocumented Legal Services Center $900,000 per year under the Undocumented Student Services Program.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of questions with the incoming Trump administration, what it means for universities and what it means for students,” Napolitano said on Jan. 6, speaking to a group of UC journalists. “We don’t have answers to those questions, nobody knows the answers.”</p>\n<p>To combat the unknown, the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) released a set of principles in December listing the boundaries of university police and medical services. “We are very clear that we are not turning university police into surrogate immigration agents, and we’re not gonna be voluntarily turning over student records,” she said.</p>\n<p>When asked about retaliation from the federal government if the UC does not comply with the new presidency, Napolitano said the UC was not in immediate threat.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of talk, particularly in the Republican party right now, about cutting funding in a lot of areas,” she said. “They haven’t singled out campuses, nor have they singled out campuses that have stated their values as we have.”</p>\n<p>Others, though a small minority, support Trump’s ideas and believe undocumented students do not have a place on UC campuses.</p>\n<p>A student who wished to stay anonymous, fearing retaliation, has begun organizing efforts to report undocumented students who attend UC Santa Barbara. He said the group is in a “planning and monitoring phase only” prior to Trump’s inauguration, hoping for a “likely scenario” that the future president will repeal DACA.</p>\n<p>“If Trump lets us down, then it is possible that this will lead nowhere,” he said. “We have a large and growing number of students on board and we have notified the university of our plans, but for the time being, we are all waiting until January 20th.”</p>\n<p>The group is not affiliated with any campus organization, according to the student, and its goal is ensure that UCSB abides by United States immigration laws.</p>\n<p>“I cannot reveal our tactics yet,” the student said. “All I can say for now, is that we consider ourselves to be an honest and patriotic team of whistleblowers when it comes to the potentially illegal activity happening at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Students who have been vocal about reporting undocumented immigrants on the UCSB campus have received threats on social media, and the student who spoke with the <em>Nexus</em> said he had heard violent, threatening rumors and been called a “fascist and a Nazi.”</p>\n<p>In response to a question regarding students who hope to join similar groups at other UC’s, Napolitano said Jan. 6 that it would be more prudent to focus on reporting criminal activity, rather than young people who travel to the U.S. to gain an education.</p>\n<p>Students are currently in the final planning stages of a large walkout to take place on inauguration day Jan. 20, with the Student Activist Network hosting several meetings to create posters and make maps of a march route.</p>\n<p>Administrators and faculty from UCSB have created an ad-hoc committee to discuss undocumented students’ safety while on campus. Among several ideas, campus administrators hope to distribute “know your rights” pamphlets, create faculty sanctuary homes for students and reinforce mental health services for students who feel threatened.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 15, Santa Barbara Police Chief Lori Luhnow said that the SBPD was committed to protecting individual rights, reassuring concerned residents.</p>\n<p>“We will continue to arrest and seek prosecution of anyone who has committed a crime in Santa Barbara, but the immigration status alone of individuals in Santa Barbara is NOT a matter for police action,” she said in a statement.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74791\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uncertainty-for-undocumented-as-inauguration-looms/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74791\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uncertainty-for-undocumented-as-inauguration-looms/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uncertainty-for-undocumented-as-inauguration-looms/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uncertainty-for-undocumented-as-inauguration-looms/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uncertainty-for-undocumented-as-inauguration-looms/","id":2446,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2445,2444,2443],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
