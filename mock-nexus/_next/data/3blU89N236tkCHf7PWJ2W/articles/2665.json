It was an even busier day for university police officers.</p>\n<p>Extravaganza, UC Santa Barbara’s annual spring concert, featured electronic duo ODESZA, rap group Rae Sremmurd and rapper/singer Anderson .Paak, among several other artists. Many of the students who swarmed the soccer stadium to see the big-name acts were, according to the arrest and citation statistics, intoxicated.</p>\n<p>UCSB police (UCPD) arrested 11 people and ejected 45 from the annual spring concert, which was plagued by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/731969843029626880\" target=\"_blank\">long lines</a> after opening its doors at 1:30 p.m.</p>\n<p>UCPD arrested eight people for being drunk in public, two for falsely identifying themselves to a police officer and one person for illegally taking a bicycle and resisting arrest, according to Sgt. Rob Romero. UCPD also issued three alcohol citations and one for urinating in public.</p>\n<p>The 45 ejections, which include some of the people arrested, resulted from students jumping the fence, not having their student IDs or bringing prohibited items into the venue, Romero said.</p>\n<p><em>Update [May 17]: </em>Santa Barbara County Fire Captain Dave Zaniboni said Tuesday morning that paramedics responded to 22 medical calls and transported nine people to the hospital from the Extravaganza concert.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

School workshop Thursday evening in the Dolores Huerta Conference Room to share information on the resources available to first generation, underrepresented students pursuing graduate education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chican@ Studies Department peer advisors Carmen Mares and Beatriz Cano geared the workshop toward students of color, providing information about the application process to obtain a master’s degree or a Ph.D. The presentations provided an overview about applying for financial aid, studying for the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) and making connections with faculty members to get into a desired graduate program. Current graduate students discussed potential routes to graduate school and personal circumstances which motivated them to continue their education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third-year Chican@ studies and Black studies double major Veronica Mandujano said she was compelled to attend this workshop because she does not know anyone who has gone to graduate school prior to the workshop.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I just want to know every resource available to me,” Mandujano said. “I want to know who I can link up with, and who can offer me information when I need it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mandujano said the workshop offered several resources for attendees, including information about fellowships, paying for grad school and out-of-state schooling.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a great presentation and I learned a lot but mainly planning ahead, planning as much as much as you can … and the different types of grad schools that are available,” Mandujano said. “Speaking to current grad students was just kind of a more personal time to understand their experience.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chican@ studies teaching assistant Terri Cecchine said she went through the same experiences and felt it was her responsibility to relay information about the graduate school process to students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am the first in my family to pursue a Ph.D., to receive a masters, so when I was approached by Carmen and Betty, of course I wanted to help out,” Cecchine said. “I have to help those that are following in the path that I have carved out for myself, it’s not easy for everyone to get here and so now that we are here, it’s really important that we network and give back, and give our wisdom.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Cecchine, a low percentage of minority students acquire Ph.D.’s due to financial and social circumstances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like it’s really hard given the obstacles that a lot of people of color are born into – the lack of resources, lack of network, lack of peer support and lack of parental support,” Cecchine said. “For whatever reason, all of those things are prominent in white communities or communities that don’t have financial stipulations, so they are obviously given a lot more access to education.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chican@ studies department peer advisor Carmen Mares said she held the workshop because she would like more guidance in applying to graduate school, and felt many other students were in the same position.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a peer advisor here has helped me provide resources to other students, especially students that are Latino, Chicano that are first generation,” Mares said. “That’s a goal as a peer advisor to help other students like me that don’t really know what their career goals are at the moment.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chican@ studies department peer advisor Beatriz Cano said her main goal was to reach out to first-generation students upon becoming a peer advisor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[My goal is] to reach out to Chicanos, to let them know that they weren’t alone, they didn’t have to struggle,” Cano said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cano said she wanted to host the workshop because she was struggling to find resources to aid her graduate school application process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am pretty sure that people are interested in grad school and are struggling as bad as we are and so the purpose of this workshop is for us to help them and to help ourselves, to create this community,” Cano said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

A.S.

According to Yun, the goal of the festival is to celebrate native identity and unite native students with their culture.</p>\n<p>“The event originated in 1975 when some native students couldn’t go home for Thanksgiving, so we began to offer an alternative for those students,” Yun said. “It’s a safe space for our native students and allies and every student is welcome to attend.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to table the request until next week to discuss the use of the organization’s one-time exception clause in the allocation of funds.</p>\n<p>Pi Sigma Rho representative Bharat Raman requested $170 for an outreach barbeque.</p>\n<p>Raman said the event is for potential members of the physics honors society.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of this event would be to interact with prospective new members, get people to join,” Raman said. “We’re speaking to freshman physics classes which have hundreds of students.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B Vice-Chair and third-year political science major Isabelle Ninh said the committee cannot fund “recruitment events.”</p>\n<p>“Since the event is for physics students with certain requirements, it is more of a recruitment event than an open-student event,” Ninh said.</p>\n<p>The committee voted unanimously to decline funding to the organization based on the nature of the event.</p>\n<p>Cultura Arts representative Marla Arciniega requested $705 to fund their annual Dia de los Muertos event.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to fully fund the event.</p>\n<p>Japanese Language Cafe representatives Kai Kawashina and Sheila Ho requested $98 to hold a Uri Uri workshop and karaoke night/potluck.</p>\n<p>Kawashina said the events are a way for American students learning about Japanese culture or language to interact with international students from Japan.</p>\n<p>“The students from Japan can teach the American students who are learning Japanese or Japanese culture,” Kawashina said. “It’s a community to learn about Japanese culture using Japanese language”</p>\n<p>The committee voted to bundle and fully fund the two events.</p>\n<p>UCSBreaking representatives Christina Chong, Chris Pom and Steven Hu requested $1,350 to host a breakdancing competition at UCSB. They requested $1050 for judges and DJs, and $300 for prize money.</p>\n<p>Hu said the event is a way the group to gain recognition as a breakdancing club.</p>\n<p>“It’s a great way to get people interested in our club and it allows us to expand our club,” Hu said.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to partially fund their request, excluding the prize money, because it is against precedent to allot prize money to an organization.</p>\n<p>Lambda Sigma Gamma requested $1,300 to hold a Mr. Greek Universe pageant to raise money for their national philanthropy: California Head Start Program. The event is open to all of Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>A Lambda Sigma Gamma student representative said the event is a way to encourage inter-Greek relations while raising money for a cause that helps young students across the state.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund the fundraiser event, under the condition that all UCSB would be free to participate and attend the event.</p>\n<p>Afrikan Black Coalition student representatives Gold Okafor and Odera Anakwenze requested $30,000 for an annual Afrikan Black Coalition Conference held on Feb. 12 to Feb. 14 that spans the whole UC system. It was last held at UCSB in 2007 with 400 people. This year, Afrikan Black Coalition anticipates 900 people will be in attendance.</p>\n<p>Okafor said the conference is a way for black students on campus to gather as a community and learn about the way their community interacts with the world. Students will also learn from prominent black public figures about future professional success. Student will learn about the theme of the event, “Planting the seeds of the future, planning our next steps.“</p>\n<p>“It’s really important that black people on our campus and anyone in our community feel welcome here and are able to see each other and really flourish,” Okafor said.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund the event, with $15,000 from the OSL funds and $15,000 from the Culture weeks and graduation funds for the Winter 2016 quarter.</p>\n<p>Health and Wellness Liaisons for the Residence Hall Association (RHA) Jose Magana and Paloma Hinojosa requested $2,474 to install condom dispensers in each of UCSB’s residential halls. Currently, students in the residence halls may obtain condoms by requesting them from their hall’s Safe Sex Peer or Residence Hall Advisors.</p>\n<p>Magana and Hinojosa said the goal of the dispensers would be to make condoms more accessible for the general student body and promote safer sex.</p>\n<p>“There’s a stigma for going to another person to get a condom, even the Safe Sex Peers, and we want to eliminate that stigma. We want to put the dispensers somewhere where all students will have access to them.”</p>\n<p>The committee had concerns about the safety of the dispensers, and voted to table the request indefinitely as A.S. representative works collaboratively with RHA to create a safer, more functional condom dispenser plan.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

of the campaign is to increase the size and diversity of the C.A.P.S. staff.</p>\n<p>“I think that we should prioritise diversity in hiring more therapists … so that students don’t have to wait longer to see a therapist after they’ve seen a therapist for the first time,” Zohoori said.</p>\n<p>Zohoori said there are concerns about increasing outreach, because C.A.P.S. already has limited resources.</p>\n<p>“We also really want to work on outreach, but it’s a big catch-22 because the more outreach we do, the less we’ll be able to support our students with the care that they deserve,”
