Executive Director Marisela Márquez gave an opening remark about her personal connection to the tragedy because she previously lived in San Antonio, Texas, an hour away from where the shooting happened.</p>\n<p>“It is odd to see your hometown through the television screen … it doesn’t have to be like this,” Márquez said, referencing the long-debated issue of gun control legislation.</p>\n<p>“Many of us, including myself, read headline after headline, and it can feel distant,” said Kristin Hsu, a fourth-year Asian-American studies major and A.S. external vice-president for statewide affairs.</p>\n<p>“Holding a space where people can share their emotions and responses encourages the UCSB community to seek support in times of need and to not be afraid in doing so,” Hsu added.</p>\n<p>Attendees also discussed the wide availability of guns in the United States, the blame on mental illness for shootings and the stricter gun laws in countries such as Japan and Australia.</p>\n<p>Director of UCSB’s MultiCultural Center Zaveeni Khan-Marcus also spoke about the prejudice that appears against members of the Muslim community when mass shootings happen in the United States.</p>\n<p>Brandt spoke about the May 23, 2014, shooting in Isla Vista and said it is “easy to feel hopeless” when similar events take place around the country.</p>\n<p>“The collective trauma that links from 2014 is a very real thing and it’s important for people to have a space to process that,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to mourn and heal over innocent lives lost together, especially when our community has been touched by similar tragedy and violence,” Hsu added.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79559\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79559\" data-attachment-id=\"79559\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-08/students-hold-vigil-for-victims-of-sutherland-springs-tragedy/community-members-share-their-experience-at-the-vigil-for-texas/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1334&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1334\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Community members share their experience at the Vigil for Texas\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79559\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-79559\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Leaders of the Isla Vista Community Service District Spencer Brandt (center) and Jonathan Abboud joined the vigil. <em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Vigil attendees also discussed the mass shooting in Las Vegas on Oct. 1 that killed 58 people. <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-03/isla-vistans-share-fears-frustrations-after-mass-shooting-in-las-vegas/\">Students hosted a vigil for the shooting on Oct. 3</a> in the I.V.

times before she finally reached South Korea after serving seven years in the North Korean People’s Army.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara’s Liberty in North Korea (L.I.N.K.) chapter hosted the two North Korean defectors this Thursday to talk about human rights violations and their journeys in escaping a dictatorship.</p>\n<p>L.I.N.K. brought the defectors to campus through its partnership with Young North Korea, a South Korean nonprofit organization that focuses on awareness of North Korean human rights.</p>\n<p>According to Athena Wan, the club’s co-president and a third-year economics and accounting major, the UCSB L.I.N.K. chapter is dedicated to funding escape missions, helping North Korean refugees integrate into the world and creating a community around human rights activism.</p>\n<p>Kim said he was part of the <i>kochebi</i>, a group of orphaned children of the “hostile” or lower class. The children would scavenge and beg for food in the streets after the economic turmoil that resulted from the death of President Kim Il-Sung in 1994.</p>\n<p>According to Kim, the lower class in North Korea is constantly under surveillance. Citizens who associate with any religion, make contact outside of the country or show dissent toward the government are criminalized and discriminated against.</p>\n<p>The second defector was a part of the “core” or elite class due to her father’s position as a battalion commander, but her whole family was placed in the hostile class after her mother’s escape to China.</p>\n<p>After her second escape attempt, she was captured but released after promising the government that she would spy on her neighbors and friends. She was imprisoned and released again after her third attempt, but was frustrated with the political structure and finally escaped to South Korea.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76763\" style=\"width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76763\" data-attachment-id=\"76763\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-09/north-korean-defectors-share-stories-at-ucsb/img_9093/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?fit=960%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_9093\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76763\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76763\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Elizabeth Hong</em></p></div>\n<p>Yang Mo, Young North Korea’s College Student Alliance external affairs representative, said he works with other organizations throughout South Korea to facilitate the integration of defectors into education and the workforce.</p>\n<p>Both defectors are now students at universities in South Korea.
