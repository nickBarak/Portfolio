Senate on Wednesday, highlighting the specific changes and non-changes to the policy.</p>\n<p>The UC-wide sexual violence and sexual harassment policy is currently in a formal review period.</p>\n<p>The policy previously stated that all graduate students were mandatory reporters of any sexual harassment or violence. Now, graduate students are only mandatory reporters when “we’re in our capacity as an employee,” Selvidge said.</p>\n<p>“We are not particularly well trained in this,” she said. “We have sort of a one-hour… online training that covers explanations of all of sexual violence, all of sexual harassment, stalking, dating and domestic violence … It’s really not enough to have us understand how to respond sensitively.”</p>\n<p>Selvidge emphasized that all other student employees who are paid by the university remain “responsible employees,” meaning they are required to report to the Title IX office in the event that they become aware of sexual violence or harassment committed against another student while they are acting as employees.</p>\n<p>Selvidge also discussed changes to the definition of consent. The committee now defines consent as “unable to understand the…nature of sexual activity due to…alcohol and drugs.”</p>\n<p>The policy’s change says the student would need to be incapacitated for consent to be questioned, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the formal investigation time period has been increased from sixty calendar days to ninety business days.</p>\n<p>She explained the change stemmed from the university, stating they have struggled with finding enough time to complete investigations within the sixty 60 calendar day time restraint limit in the past.</p>\n<p>The student’s decision of whether or not they want a formal investigation is now not a determining factor of whether they actually get a formal investigation, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>“The university will investigate things without people’s consent,” Selvidge said.</p>\n<p>Another aspect of the Title IX policy that Selvidge outlined in her presentation was in regards to the sexual assault of minors.</p>\n<p>UCSB does not consider statutory rape to be sexual assault, according to Selvidge. She pointed out that the university is trying to keep in mind 17-year-olds and their dating life.</p>\n<p>However, several graduate students at the GSA meeting expressed their concern for their own children living on campus. It worried them that the university does not see the possible rape of their children as sexual assault, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>Selvidge also discussed the new revision to the definition of sexual assault penetration and contact, which now includes language that is more inclusive toward the LGBTQ+ community, as well as male victims.</p>\n<p>“I am actually very happy with this particular change. This is something that I worked on convincing them for several years,” Selvidge said.</p>\n<p>Power imbalances, such as the dynamic between a teacher assistant and a student, are now taken into consideration as aggravating circumstances in the new policy, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>Relationship violence has also been expanded to include non-physical conduct such as the abuse of a pet or the destruction of property.</p>\n<p>The Title IX Student Advisory Board consists of one undergraduate and one graduate student from each UC campus, making a total of 19 board members.</p>\n<p>Currently, the undergraduate position for UCSB is vacant. Students who are interested should contact Ariana Alvarez, the Title IX Officer for UCSB.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

id=\"caption-attachment-84302\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">IVCSD board members also expressed concerns about the safety of Bird scooters in I.V., highlighting the potential for accidents and hazardous misuse of the scooters. <em>Sicheng Weng / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCPD has taken a “hands off” approach to the regulation of scooters on campus so far, despite requests for them to “heavily impound” the scooters, according to Matt Bowman, UCPD Acting Lieutenant, who spoke at Tuesday’s I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting.</p>\n<p>The scooters are currently categorized under the title of motor vehicles, according to Bowman, who says a citation for riding a Bird on campus could cost $250.</p>\n<p>Bowman says that officers are doing “limited enforcement” of scooters and responding on a complaint basis.</p>\n<p>Despite this, students have ridden the scooters on campus with little to no consequences.</p>\n<p>To better regulate these policies, UCSB formed a committee which includes several university organizations such as Associated Students, UCPD and Transportation and Parking Services among others, according to Jennifer Lofthus, UCSB’s policy coordinator and deputy ADA compliance officer.</p>\n<p>The Committee is considering geofencing as one form of regulation, which would shut off scooters once they pass a certain geographical location, said Associate Dean of Students Don Lubach at the Graduate Student Association meeting Tuesday evening.</p>\n<p>In UCSB’s case, this could be Pardall Tunnel, Lubach said.</p>\n<p>At the I.V. CSD meeting on Oct. 9, Bird City Launcher Benjamin Jacobs discussed Bird’s plans to institute a “no-ride zone” for campus on the Bird app.</p>\n<p>“People will… get a notification that they’re entering a no-ride zone which we can tag based on [the university’s] requirements,” Jacobs said.</p>\n<p>The company currently does not have plans to throttle the scooters entering campus.</p>\n<p>Bird also plans to hire members of the I.V. community as “bird sweepers or watchers” who would manage the removal of Bird scooters on campus as well as educating users on how to safely operate the product, Jacobs said.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD board members also expressed concern about the safety of Bird scooters in I.V., highlighting the potential for accidents and hazardous misuse of the scooters.</p>\n<p>As an example of the I.V. CSD’s worries about the scooters, I.V. CSD Director Jay Freeman pointed out that a Bird scooter had washed up onto the beach over the weekend.</p>\n<p>In response, Jacobs said the initial sign-up process on Bird’s app requires users to watch a video that explains the rules of scooter use, which includes riding only on streets, wearing a helmet and limiting the number of persons per scooter to one.</p>\n<p>Jacobs also added that safety is a “priority” for the Bird company.</p>\n<p>The company is also considering taking the scooters off streets in I.V. during periods when high alcohol consumption among residents is likely, he said. This effort would be in hopes of reducing the amount of people operating Bird scooters while intoxicated.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD said Santa Barbara County plans to set regulations regarding the use of scooters in unincorporated territory, such as I.V., in November.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Jan. 9, 2019]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>On Saturday morning, a gunman shouting anti-semitic slurs killed 11 people in the Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh, Penn.</p>\n<p>“It’s sad… and it’s hard to be reminded that there’s something about yourself that people are going to take issue with and that people are going to attack,” Olivia Lazarus, an attendee at Tuesday’s vigil hosted by Santa Barbara Hillel, said.</p>\n<p>Many other attendees shared this sentiment as they gathered at the base of Storke Tower to hear student leaders and university officials address this recent tragedy.</p>\n<p>“[UCSB is] outraged by the violence in our nation and pour out our support and care for our Jewish community here and across the nation, who have been targeted by this act of hate and terror,” UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang said.</p>\n<p>“With tragedy comes the time to stand strong against the fear and bigotry and stand up for kindness, compassion and open mindedness.”</p>\n<p>Chancellor Yang represented one of the many organizations responsible for co-hosting the event alongside Santa Barbara Hillel. The event was officially titled, “Standing With Pittsburgh Against Hate.”</p>\n<p>Miri Klein, co-director of Chabad at UCSB, also spoke at the memorial and was one of the hosts of the “Mitzvah for Pittsburgh” event in the Arbor on Monday.</p>\n<p>“Love and kindness and goodness are like steel. Hate can try and destroy that, but like steel, goodness and kindness will never be able to be destroyed. And all of us coming here together is proof that love and kindness will always prevail,” she said at the vigil.</p>\n<p>Jeike Meijer, External Vice President of Local Affairs for Associated Students, closed the ceremony with a reading of the names of the 11 victims and a song in her native language.</p>\n<p>“I think that you can see how the UCSB community was impacted by how many people showed up today. How many people came, of different groups to show support and stand in solidarity. I think that shows the impact that it [the synagogue shooting] made,” Meijer said.</p>\n<p>For some students, this recent tragedy may influence how they choose to vote in the midterms next Tuesday, Lazarus said.</p>\n<p>”When public officials who are trying to fight discrimination, fight gun laws and try to create stricter regulations, it’s going to make things like this happen less often,” Lazarus said.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it’s going to eradicate it, but it’s gonna make it happen less.”</p>\n<p>At Chabad’s table in the Arbor on Monday, the organization encouraged students to write down good deeds and add them to a board that they plan on sending to the Jewish community in Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Gershon Klein explained that mitzvot, or good deeds, are a way for Jewish people to bring light to the world during times of darkness.</p>\n<p>“A mitzvah can mean different things. One of the main things it means is to be connected… we bring light from the essence of our soul outwards into the revealed world, like right here in Isla Vista,” Gershon said.</p>\n<p>One of the mitzvot Gershon performed was wrapping tefillin around the arms of male students. This particular mitzvah is specifically for men, Gershon said.</p>\n<p>“This is a mitzvah which represents being in the oneness of hashem, God, down into the world. We put it opposite the heart, on top of the head, because often, our heart and our head give us different messages. The whole idea of tefillin is to bring oneness, inside of ourselves and in the world,” Gershon said.</p>\n<p>“So in the place where the biggest friction happens, between our emotions and our mind, we want to bind it and bring oneness to it.”</p>\n<p>Daniel Caduri, an exchange student from Germany, mourned the loss of the United States as a sanctuary for Jewish people. In Europe, Caduri said, synagogues and other Jewish facilities typically have security guards.</p>\n<p>“In the U.S. it was actually quite opposite. When you go there, everything’s open, you can just enter the room because there was no fear of danger so far. So I don’t know how it will change now,” he said.</p>\n<p>“I hope that America will [still] remain a safe place.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84669\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-students-come-together-to-mourn-the-lives-lost-at-the-synagogue-in-pittsburgh/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84669\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-students-come-together-to-mourn-the-lives-lost-at-the-synagogue-in-pittsburgh/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-students-come-together-to-mourn-the-lives-lost-at-the-synagogue-in-pittsburgh/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-students-come-together-to-mourn-the-lives-lost-at-the-synagogue-in-pittsburgh/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-students-come-together-to-mourn-the-lives-lost-at-the-synagogue-in-pittsburgh/","id":2210,"author":{"id":33,"name":"Isabell Liu"},"related":[2209,2208,2207],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Edible Campus Program Breaks Ground on Its Biggest Project Yet","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-10-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/EDIBLE-CAMPUS_Nicole-Wallace_ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/EDIBLE-CAMPUS_Nicole-Wallace_ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The program plans to donate the food from the farm to the A.S.

Department of Public Worms will be the primary manager of the farm once it is constructed. <em>Nicole Wallace / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“This project has been something that we’ve been really actively working on for about four years, although it was in our minds even before that,” Maynard said. “In order to get to this stage, we’ve had to work with so many different people.”</p>\n<p>Funding for the farm came from the UC Global Food Initiative, A.S. Coastal Fund, the Green Initiative Fund, the Food Security Taskforce, the Healthy Campus Network and the Fund for Santa Barbara Youth Making Change Board, among others.</p>\n<p>“A recent survey showed that 48% of undergraduate students surveyed and 31% of graduate students surveyed reported experiencing food insecurity in the past year,” Margaret Klawunn, the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs, said in a speech at the farm’s groundbreaking event on West Campus.</p>\n<p>“Today we’re starting an effort that will help to reclaim food waste and create food for students who need it the most.”</p>\n<p>Maynard said the new farm will produce far more food than any of the Edible Campus Program’s current projects. However, she was not able to give an estimate on how much food that would be.</p>\n<p>“It is hard to put an exact number on how much we will produce as we are proposing an innovative approach, mother nature is not always predictable, and we haven’t started farming yet,” Maynard said in an email.</p>\n<p>The construction of the farm will go through December and the beds for the farm will be built in the winter. The Edible Campus Program will be able to start planting in the spring, Maynard said.</p>\n<p>The A.S. Department of Public Worms will be the primary manager of the farm once it is constructed.</p>\n<p>“We registered 2,697 students in the last academic year for Calfresh and now we’re creating the space for students to grow their own food through campus gardens and farms,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>The food will be picked on the farm and delivered to the pantries on the same day, according to Alex Moon, Edible Campus Program student coordinator.</p>\n<p>“Our farm is built on a garden movement that stretches back over 40 years at UCSB and even longer in Isla Vista,” Moon said in a speech at the groundbreaking event. “We are so lucky to be a part of a university which celebrates student leadership and engages students in the shared governance of our community.”</p>\n<p>“As students, we are given the rare opportunity to dream up new ideas and test them right here on campus.”</p>\n<p>Aside from the new farm, the Edible Campus Program is also working on vertical hydroponic gardens at the UCSB Recreation Center, an urban orchard at Storke Plaza and an urban agriculture educational series.</p>\n<p>“It takes many hands to make the vision for the student farm a reality,” Chancellor Yang said in a speech at the groundbreaking event. “This farm will be a vital part of our campus food initiative and also our proud sustainability practices.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.
