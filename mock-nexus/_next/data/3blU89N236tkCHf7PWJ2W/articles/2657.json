Last year, UCSB American Red Cross held a bake sale to raise money for victims of the earthquake in Nepal.</p>\n<p>Internal vice president of UCSB American Red Cross and third-year biology major Allie Liu said she hopes UCSB will come out and support the Red Cross’s attempts to help Syrian refugees.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to support the Syrian refugees,” Liu said. “The American Red Cross, along with UNHCR, is providing food, shelter and anything that these people who are coming from a country in chaos may need.”</p>\n<p>President of UCSB American Red Cross and fourth-year biology major Heather Halaweh said students really like the bake sale and ask questions about the refugees overseas.</p>\n<p>“When we do the bake sale, we try to choose something that’s current, and we want something that a lot of people care about because it’s an occurrence that is happening on such a large scale,” Halaweh said.</p>\n<p>According to Halaweh, the American Red Cross is working to pair new refugees with other refugees who have been in the country for a while to provide an understanding of what it’s like to come from a war zone.</p>\n<p>“They help them assimilate, so I think that’s really cool,” Halaweh said.<br>\nFourth-year global studies major Arivanh Onevathana said she was excited to hear the Syrian Refugee Bake Sale was taking place.</p>\n<p>“We are always looking out for others and are very aware of what is currently happening in the world around us,” Onevathana said. “I was stoked to see the creative baked goods only being sold for a dollar because what better way to support by contributing to the cause than to enjoy delicious pastries at the same time? It’s a nice way for UCSB students to send aid during this time of crisis.”</p>\n<p>Halaweh said the bake sale is one of her favorite events the club hosts because fundraising is one of the three main tenants that the club adheres to in addition to volunteering and offering certification courses.</p>\n<p>“It just feels good to raise money for Syrians refugees who have been huge on the news recently,” Halaweh said. “It’s great to see the campus come out and support them.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65428\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/bake-sale-raises-funds-for-syrian-refugees-in-need/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65428\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/bake-sale-raises-funds-for-syrian-refugees-in-need/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/bake-sale-raises-funds-for-syrian-refugees-in-need/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/bake-sale-raises-funds-for-syrian-refugees-in-need/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/bake-sale-raises-funds-for-syrian-refugees-in-need/","id":2657,"author":{"id":117,"name":"Effie Sklavenitis"},"related":[2656,2655,2654],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":117,"name":"Effie Sklavenitis","biography":"Not available","articles":[2492,2523,2531,2558,2574,2597,2599,2622,2638,2657,3608,3616,3636,3855,3869,4600,4657],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Frats Address Sexual Assault, Masculinity Issues","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Inter Fraternity Council (IFC) hosted a forum on masculinity and sexual assault for Greek fraternity members in Campbell Hall Monday evening.

Greek chapters’ members are required to meet a quarterly minimum of three accreditation meetings. Forum keynote speaker and fourth-year economics and sociology double major Siavash Zohoori spoke about how society’s expectations of masculinity can be harmful to men by making them feel entitled to women’s bodies which can lead to sexual assault. Attendees were able to publically share their opinions and experiences afterwards in a mediated safe space.</p>\n<p>According to Zohoori, men who do not adhere to society’s expectations of masculinity can suffer “inner turmoil.” Zohoori said the concept of traditional masculinity affected Elliott Rodgers, the 22-year-old <em>Santa Barbara City College</em> student responsible for the death of six UC Santa Barbara students.</p>\n<p>After recounting his experience of being present at the scene of one of the shootings on May 23 last year, Zohoori said it is crucial for students to foster a better future by encouraging positive gender roles.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65861\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"146885196\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65881\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65861\" data-attachment-id=\"65861\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/frats-address-sexual-assault-masculinity-issues/ifc_by-lorenzo-basilio-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D750\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1445898323\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"90\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IFC\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65861\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65861\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><em>“</em>I don’t want anyone to be a victim to anything that caused what happened to me, whether its sexual assault, shootings, being beat up or violence between men,” Zohoori said. “I don’t want anyone to be a victim of any issues with masculinity the same way I was or in any comparable way.”</p>\n<p>Zohoori said he mediated the event to allow participants to safely share their experiences without getting “lectured” about the specifics of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“I called them out when I needed to, and I supported them. They feel comfortable and we actually got somewhere — we started a good conversation,” Zohoori said. “I’m not here to scold them, I’m not here to tell them what sexual assault is because they all know what it is, they just don’t know how they play a role in it.”</p>\n<p>Zohoori said society should support men who do not identify with traditional expectations of masculinity, rather than judge them.</p>\n<p>“The next step is to stop blaming issues with the men, with mental health, and realize that if we keep shit-talking about something, we are not actually going to get the space to support it,” Zohoori said. “The next step is to actually start supporting the people who we feel need it, who we feel like we are blaming, and actually start supporting these communities.”</p>\n<p>IFC President and fourth-year French and philosophy double-major Gregory Rousso said other accreditation meetings have discussed topics such as hazing, alcohol and drug abuse.</p>\n<p>“It’s really a chance to have your whole fraternity there and absorb the information, and seeing that we are all in this together — we are a Greek community,” Rousso said.</p>\n<p>Rousso said he was impressed by the number of fraternity chapters and members who attended the meeting.</p>\n<p>“We expect 75 percent of all membership to be here and we had a pretty impressive turnout here,” Rousso said. “I think having the majority of every fraternity is huge because, at the end of the day, it comes out of the culture within each house.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65860\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1349893753\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65881\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65860\" data-attachment-id=\"65860\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/frats-address-sexual-assault-masculinity-issues/ifc_by-lorenzo-basilio-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D750\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1445898302\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IFC\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65860\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x684.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65860\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Hechler said sexual assault is the biggest problem for fraternities nationwide.</p>\n<p>“I thought the first step had to be to get everyone to know about what is happening, then we can educate them from there,” Hechler said.</p>\n<p>Kappa Sigma President and fifth-year history major Fady Antoun said it is important for fraternity members to be educated on the issue of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“As a leader of one of these organizations, I feel it’s important because it is an issue that’s been rampant through our community not just this year or last year, but for all the years that Greeks have been around,” Antoun said.</p>\n<p>Antoun said he appreciated Zohoori’s honesty during the discussion.</p>\n<p>“He actually spilled out his heart up there,” Antoun said. “I know my fraternity and myself we are all about the honesty.

Senator Bernie Sanders as he seeks the Democratic presidential nomination, is hosting “Chalk-the-Block” Thursday at 4 p.m. to imprint Isla Vista with images and words promoting Sanders’ campaign.</p>\n<p>The goal of the event is to cover I.V. streets and sidewalks with slogans and pictures of Sanders to bring attention to his campaign. As of Oct. 27, the event’s Facebook page shows 243 people plan to attend. UCSB-4-Bernie strategically planned the event two days before Halloween to take advantage of the large crowds over the holiday weekend and maximize views of the chalk.</p>\n<p>Third-year religious studies major Eric Daniel Villalobos said he helped plan the event and UCSB students who support Sanders plan to chalk phrases and questions relevant to Sanders’ campaign, such as, “Are the banks too big?”</p>\n<p>“We’re going to be chalking — along with pictures and slogans — questions like, ‘Is education a right or only for a privileged few?’” Villalobos said. “Hopefully, all the people walking through I.V. during the weekend will stop and notice.”</p>\n<p>According to Villalobos, the aim of the event is to build support for Sanders at UCSB and in I.V. and to encourage young people to engage in politics.</p>\n<p>“We want [to] build on the energy we see here for Bernie’s message and campaign,” Villalobos said. “We want all the supporters here to get energized, to get involved and be active participants in the political process.”</p>\n<p>Villalobos said all students are welcome to participate in the event.</p>\n<p>“All they have to do is show up,” Villalobos said. “In terms of the event, if they want to bring their own chalk, they’re more than welcome to.”</p>\n<p>Villalobos also said he believes college students are supportive of Sanders because of his stance on topics like college tuition and various social issues.</p>\n<p>“Fighting for free public education doesn’t hurt your standing with college students,” Villalobos said. “He seems to have always been on the right side of history. He got arrested for holding anti-segregation rallies, he marched with MLK, he endorsed marriage equality decades before it became politically expedient to do so.”</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Nicole Truong said the event allows people to get to know other individuals who share their beliefs and ideas.</p>\n<p>“I’m looking forward to seeing people at the event who share the same views as me, and I’m interested in meeting new people and hearing their thoughts and opinions,” Truong said in an email.</p>\n<p>Second-year communication and economics double major Cynthia Jiang said the event is a good opportunity learn from fellow Sanders supporters.</p>\n<p>“I’m looking forward to meeting fellow Bernie supporters and getting new perspectives from others on issues that surround the presidential election,” Jiang said.</p>\n<p>Jiang said she hopes participants and community members who see the chalk will recognize student’s grassroots efforts.</p>\n<p>“What really stuck out to me about Bernie’s campaign and what I hope people will learn about the most is that you can always make a change if you’re dedicated enough to your cause,” Jiang said.</p>\n<p>First-year sociology major Logan Clement said the public should better understand Bernie Sanders’ stance of “democratic socialism,” which is defined as a specific type of socialism which supports public ownership of the production of goods paired with a democratic political system.</p>\n<p>“I like that [Sanders] is pushing for affordable health care and education. I also wish more people understood what Sanders means by ‘democratic socialism’ rather than using that language to disengage from his message,” Clement said in an email. “He’s also one of the most outspoken advocates of racial justice.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65873\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/student-group-to-chalk-the-block-for-bernie-sanders/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65873\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/student-group-to-chalk-the-block-for-bernie-sanders/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/student-group-to-chalk-the-block-for-bernie-sanders/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/student-group-to-chalk-the-block-for-bernie-sanders/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/student-group-to-chalk-the-block-for-bernie-sanders/","id":2656,"author":{"id":127,"name":"Amy Koo"},"related":[2655,2654,2653],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Talk To Contrast Civil Rights, Religious Leaders","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Ron-Neal.jpg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Ron-Neal.jpg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1","description":"Wake Forest University Assistant Professor in the Department of Religion Dr. Ronald B.

Neal will discuss how religion has influenced perspectives on Civil Rights Movement leaders in a lecture titled “Beyond the Black Messiah: Black Lives &amp; the Limits of Heroism,” hosted by the MultiCultural Center (MCC) and the UCSB Department of Religious Studies Thursday in the MCC at 6 p.m.</p>\n<p>Neal’s lecture focuses on the equating of civil rights leaders to “messiahs,” or religious figures, and how this has influenced modern social justice movements. Dr. Neal received his Ph.D. in philosophy and religious studies from Vanderbilt University and has published works about religion, gender, culture, ethics and politics.</p>\n<p>MCC Programmer Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said Neal’s work is important because he will discuss race, culture, class and social justice-related themes frequently addressed by the MCC.</p>\n<p>“He’s intersecting that with religiosity and postulating the myth of religiosity in a specific group to that of the messiah, and kind of looking through the religious experiences of the African-American community,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “[He is] postulating that all powerful identity and how no one can really live up to it — it’s a lot of pressure — and kind of deconstructing it from there.”</p>\n<p>Mohsenian-Rahman said the “school to prison pipeline” is an example of the inequalities people of color face in society. According to Mohsenian-Rahman, 0.8 percent of Chicago’s municipal budget goes toward education while 40 percent funds the police department.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking at a community that has a very large concentration of incarcerated brown and black young men in particular,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “Those numbers can be extrapolated throughout the U.S.; those were just the numbers I had in my head this morning.”</p>\n<p>Mohsenian-Rahman said there is no one “messiah<em>”</em> in the modern racial equality movement, but rather an array of people such as Cornell West, Mark Lamont Hill, Angela Davis and Michelle Alexander.</p>\n<p>“They’re hugely involved academically in the activist circle, who are huge change-makers,” Mohsenian-Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Mohsenian-Rahman said anyone who is advocating or contributing to the “Black Lives Matter” movement is continuing the legacy of previous activists.</p>\n<p>“[They are] doing really incredible and really strong work that is ultimately for the betterment of society across racial lines,” Mohsenian-Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Isabelle Tranner said she will be attending the lecture to learn more about race issues.</p>\n<p>“This would be a good way to broaden my knowledge,” Tranner said in an email. “I’m new to this school, so I want to take advantage of everything offered.”</p>\n<p>Mohsenian-Rahman said she is excited to learn how modern America was influenced by people’s expectations of civil rights leaders.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited to see what Dr. Neal says and how he kind of links these abstract things almost rooted in religiosity to the current social landscape in the United States,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “I think it’s really fascinating, and it’s taken me a while to even fully understand what to potentially expect; it’s exciting.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Joana Barrera says she wants to attend the lecture to participate in more MCC events and to learn more about the “Black Lives Matter” movement.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s incredibly important to gain knowledge on this topic as it is fundamental to making our community more respectful towards each other,” Barrera said in an email.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65874\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/talk-to-contrast-civil-rights-religious-leaders/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65874\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/talk-to-contrast-civil-rights-religious-leaders/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/talk-to-contrast-civil-rights-religious-leaders/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/talk-to-contrast-civil-rights-religious-leaders/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/talk-to-contrast-civil-rights-religious-leaders/","id":2654,"author":{"id":137,"name":"Mohan Saxena"},"related":[2653,2652,2651],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
