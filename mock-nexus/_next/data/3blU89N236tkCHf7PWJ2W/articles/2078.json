Following his first year, he said he  “began to continue to fall in love with our community and work closely with the I.V. CRC, the Teen Center and Community Services District.” Furthermore, Griffin also worked to help students who were displaced by </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cliff collapses on Del Playa Drive</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin also owns his own aerial photography company where he takes pictures for “landlords and property management services.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas, a current off-campus senator, stated he is already working closely with the EVPLA office and is close friends with the current EVPLA, Jeike Meijer. Through his connections with the EVPLA and the office, Ornelas said “[Meijer is] constantly helping me learn more about her office and just the kind of work [that the] EVPLA should be doing, and how the EVPLA can be responsive to community needs.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas placed a heavy emphasis on representing the diversity of the I.V. community, as “we are representing a diverse amount of people, both students and non-students… so it’s really important that you’re able to connect with different communities because we all share Isla Vista and it’s really pertinent to make sure that their voices are uplifted.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One question posed by Elections Board referenced Wi-Fi in I.V. Parks; despite previous efforts, the implementation of free Wi-Fi in the parks has yet to see any tangible progress. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas provided two possible solutions: build routers into park benches or take advantage of “innovative companies that utilize satellites to ping Wi-Fi to certain areas.” However, Ornelas does not guarantee he will be able to make either of these undertakings happen, noting that the term length is not favorable to larger projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin, on the other hand, believes this may be a better job for the I.V. CSD, where he has already established “creative relationships” with some of the directors, such as Father Jon Hedges. Griffin finds that the I.V. CSD would be a more appropriate place to take on the project because they have the “space for transition projects” which can be implemented over the “course of a few years,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both candidates are familiar with the I.V. CSD, the local government representing I.V. But Griffin has worked closely with current I.V. CSD directors Ethan Bertrand and Spencer Brandt in the past; Ornelas admitted that he hasn’t “been super involved in their [I.V. CSD] meetings,” but plans to be more involved in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As brought up by the Elections Board, community outreach is a cornerstone of the EVPLA position, as it is imperative to take into account the diversity of I.V. while also acting as a liaison between the community and the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas, who speaks fluent Spanish, stressed the importance of having a diverse office and proposed the idea of creating a community outreach team to better connect with the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community outreach has a different meaning to Griffin, who has spent the past two years curating a series of interviews with long-term residents of I.V. called “The People of Isla Vista.” Griffin plans to continue this work, if elected, so he can devise a way to produce more inclusive programs that stretch out to those not necessarily affiliated with the school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Street lighting, a contentious issue that seems to never be completely remediated, is seen as a problem by both Ornelas and Griffin, although their solutions are not the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having had worked with the EVPLA office in the past, Griffin sees street lighting as a project for the I.V. CSD – one in which the EVPLA can help supplement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My plan would be to work with them [I.V. CSD]… to go out and find where more lights need to be implemented. And then working with the county and other organizations come up with a concrete plan to install lights in areas that are not fairly lit,” Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas, on the other hand, is a fan of the ongoing efforts of the EVPLA office and its recent release of a street lighting expansion </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/evpla-publishes-proposal-for-lighting-expansion-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Ornelas believes the work should remain in the office to avoid “reinventing the wheel” and restarting the project somewhere else. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas also plans to collaborate with county supervisor Joan Hartmann to “represent our voices at the county level.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an increase in attendance but a decrease in arrests, the elections board asked if it may be possible to remove Deltopia’s festival ordinance in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both candidates agree that instead of abandoning the ordinance entirely, it should be adjusted and scaled down accordingly. Furthermore, Ornelas is weary that if Deltopia becomes a sanctioned, “actual event,” there is the possible repercussion that visitors from other colleges might see the change as a potential advertisement to draw attendance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin is opposed to advertising Deltopia as a real event as well, fearing that it will draw crowds from other schools who see it as an “exclusive event.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elections Board also asked if the candidates believe the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/alcohol-drug-program-evpla-and-gauchos-for-recovery-host-naloxone-trainings/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">community naloxone trainings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> implemented in I.V. have been successful in helping residents learn how to use naloxone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both candidates are in favor of seeing the program expand more. Ornelas, who has attended a training, plans to push for Community Service Officers (CSOs) to also have naloxone on hand, as they currently do not. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about their plans to fight against sexual assault, Griffin and Ornelas proposed different approaches to the situation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas believes the best approach is to listen to the needs of the community. He also cited “really close relationships with folks in students against sexual assault” and the fact that Standing Together To End Sexual Assault (STESA), a college advocate program for sexual assault survivors, recently approached the I.V CSD for funding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin plans to work directly with the I.V. CSD to implement more Green Dot trainings, which help educate students on sexual assault and violence. On top of that, Griffin also hopes to bring the Blue Light system to I.V., which he believes will make the community feel safer at night and speed up police response times by having numerous emergency alarms around I.V. that will alert police if activated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last on the list of questions was the subject of food insecurity and its disproportionate effect on marginalized students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas placed a heavy emphasis on strengthening the services of the A.S. Food Bank and CalFresh. As a vice chair on A.S. Finance and Business, Orneals stated that “there’s honestly a lot of room for improvement in how money can be used more efficiently. So really making sure that we’re reevaluating the budget and allocating that to programs that people really need.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin is in favor of expanding the services of the A.S. Food Bank because he feels “not everybody can access it or not everybody knows about it, who is food insecure.” He would also like to work with local grocery stores to create a food bank that gives nearly-expired food for free to students.</span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.

Other officers also allegedly “confided” their concerns about Smith in Signa. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lieutenant Signa expressed concern about the “impropriety” of favoritism in the department and was later allegedly retaliated against at a lunch in or around August 2016. Sergeant Romero “attacked Signa’s position as Patrol Lieutenant, stating that the other sergeants were upset with Signa’s leadership style and were contemplating a vote of no confidence in Signa,” according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the lunch, Lieutenant Signa allegedly met with each of the six sergeants, excluding Sergeants Romero and Smith, during which “none of the sergeants expressed discontent with Signa’s leadership” or the intention to “submit a vote of no confidence against Signa,” court documents say. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shortly after, Signa was “transferred from Patrol Lieutenant to Administrative Lieutenant,” which was seen as “punishment against Signa for not ‘falling in line’ with the ‘Good Ole Boys’ Club,’” court documents state.</span></p>\n<p><b>The 2017 Internal Affairs Investigation </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In or around September 2017, court documents state that UCPD Corporal Tiffany Little “submitted a letter of complaint alleging improper and possibly unlawful conduct by Smith.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following are allegations that were included in the complaint, according to court documents:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly had “an extra-marital affair” with a subordinate UCPD officer; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith “covered up” for an automobile accident in which the subordinate officer was driving a UCPD vehicle on campus;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith was involved in an alleged hit-and-run automobile accident in which he “hit a parked car” with a UCPD vehicle;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly used police lights and sirens “to get through heavy traffic” in order to attend “a free breakfast,” while visiting UC Los Angeles;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly used UCPD resources to visit the subordinate officer in Santa Cruz;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tiffany Little, with her husband UCPD Officer Michael Little, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-03/breaking-ucpd-officers-sue-ucpd-members-for-alleged-mistreatment-after-reporting-sergeant/\">also filed a suit against several members of the UCPD on March 29 on similar charges</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Millard was allegedly tasked with investigating this complaint and shared concerns with Signa “about how the IA investigation might affect his friendship with Smith,” court documents say. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith went on leave in or around the middle of 2017 and by the end of that year received a job at the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olson, Farley and Millard allegedly said during several meetings that “having Smith get the alternate position was the easiest solution to the issues the department was facing,” court documents state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Court documents allege that the “woefully inadequate” investigation was closed right before Smith left UCPD toward the end of 2017 so the investigation would “not impede his ability to get the job” at the Office of Emergency Services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith was also allegedly treated to “a celebratory farewell lunch” and continued to have lunch with Olson, Millard and Romero after leaving the department. </span></p>\n<p><b>Signa’s Concerns and Alleged Retaliation: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa allegedly reported concerns about Smith and overall UCPD “propriety” to Olson and Farley.

The alleged retaliations included: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exclusion from “key meetings” essential for Signa’s job duties; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not being able to email Olson without notifying Farley as well and receiving criticism for not adequately communicating with Olson; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Bullying, harassing, publicly criticizing and blaming Signa in front of other officers and for unfounded reasons”;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mandatory meetings with Farley to “check-in,” in which “Signa received contradictory directives and conflicting information”; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exclusion from UCPD social events;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Resistance” from Olson to meet in private with Signa;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exclusion from “leadership, promotional and learning opportunities”; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pressure to resign early. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>University Response</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa filed a complaint with Human Resources in or around May 2018 about “his departmental concerns and the retaliation he faced for trying to voice them.” Signa met with Cynthia Señeriz, the acting director, human resources and compensation manager at UCSB, who allegedly told Signa “she would have someone follow up with him,” court documents say. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa allegedly went on stress leave on or around June 1, 2018. Shortly after, UCSB Employee &amp; Labor Relations Specialist Jessica Graham allegedly contacted Signa and said she would update him on the status of the complaint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of November 2018, Signa had not heard back from either Señeriz or Graham, according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On June 19, 2018, Signa submitted two whistleblower complaints to UCSB, but had not heard back as of November 2018 when he filed the lawsuit against the UC Police Department.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that more UCPD officers also submitted whistleblower complaints similar to Signa’s.

Austin Foreman, a first-year pre-biology major and Emma Swanson, a first-year physics major, are running with Campus United. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diaz and Swanson did not attend the forum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The questions asked by Elections Board and answered by the candidates are below: </span></p>\n<p><b>What would your first priority be if elected? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said his first priority would be to implement a committee that would create a digital library of textbooks so students wouldn’t have to purchase textbooks every quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said she would make sure Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) has more “initiative to reduce the waitlist times.” </span></p>\n<p><b>How will the two-party system with campaigning affect the way you take office? Will you be able to work effectively with members of the other party? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said polarization is a “huge issue” in the Senate, and said it’s important to be bipartisan and make sure senators are “reaching the needs of the student body instead of being focused on just our parties.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said this will not be an issue. He said he would work to fulfill students’ needs regardless of party lines. </span></p>\n<p><b>For someone who is unfamiliar with the way A.S. works and what an on-campus senator does, could you explain what you do and what do you plan to do once you take office?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman explained that students each pay approximately $600 toward A.S., which makes up a total budget of about $14 million. He said he is looking to use the money toward fixing the bike paths and implementing a system to maintain the paths, as well as increasing funding for mental health resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas echoed Foreman’s explanation of what A.S. is, adding that senators write bills and resolutions that focus on helping students’ needs. She said she would love to work on implementing workshops in all the dorm halls that would address financial aid, mental health, anti-blackness and “anything to the needs of the students that I think would really help them branch out and understand how to navigate college life.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the times first years or even fourth years people can struggle with the stress of college life or guilt for not being there to pay and provide for their families. But I think it’s really important that if this happens or if a student is struggling, that they are referred to a program or know about the resources they have here at UCSB.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Serving on the Senate is an extremely large time commitment. Just last week Senate had a meeting that ran for over 10 hours. Senators are expected to be present at various BCU meetings and have several other responsibilities as well. If you are elected, do you believe you will be able to dedicate yourself to the position and the time commitment that is needed? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said she will dedicate her time and effort to the Senate, as well as the Boards Commissions &amp; Units (BCU) meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m the type of leader who doesn’t overpower voices. I’m the type of leader who would love to sit down with a person and talk and hear their needs and the responsibilities they believe the A.S. Senate should have. In order to implement that, that requires time and effort… I want others to tell me what they need from me and work and collaborate with them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said he will be able to fulfill the time commitment required, stating he is very “time management oriented.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I also look forward to sitting on Senate regardless of the length of the meeting and following and learning the procedures of Senate… I love to liason for meetings and learn about all the different organizations on our campus and the diversity and what they wish to see in Senate.” </span></p>\n<p><b>This past year, the price to live in a double room with a 14 meal plan increased by approximately $500 dollars. What will you do to address increasing costs and make living in the dorms more affordable for on-campus students? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said he believes financial security is a “very important issue that is pressing our students at the moment.” He admitted that he is “not very educated on the cost of dorm living and the meal plan increase” but said he hopes to be educated on that once he takes his Senate seat. He repeated his plan to implement the open-source textbook program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said the rising cost of tuition is a “really prevalent problem.” To address this, she said meals swipes should be transferable and shared among students. </span></p>\n<p><b>Reports of on-campus sexual assault and dating violence have been on the rise during recent years. What would you do to address sexual violence on campus, and most importantly, how would you support and advocate for survivors?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said she would like to implement a faster emergency response system, so when students are walking from the library to Isla Vista, or from Isla Vista to the dorms, there is an “earlier response to their needs.” She added that she would like to implement a policy that would enforce harsher punishment on assaulters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said that he, along with other Campus United candidates, want to implement a Blue Light system in I.V. He added that there should be an office on campus that survivors can go to and speak to someone about what happened to them, and report on the issue “so that it can be addressed and that the assaulter be reprimanded and [so] that it does not happen again.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Do you have any leadership or work experience relating to UCSB Housing and Dining? For example, experience with RHA, or a job in the dorms, or the dining commons. If you do, how would you use your past experience to help you in your new position. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said he is the Queer-Trans Student engagement chair in the Santa Catalina South Hall council. In that position, he works to “create space spaces where people, regardless of their gender, sexuality, race, and all factors can come and enjoy themselves and express themselves.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would take this experience and bring that to Senate and make it a place where diversity is welcomed and can thrive,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said she does not have an experience with UCSB housing or dining, but said she has experience as an intern for CalPerg and worked on the affordable textbooks campaign. She added that she has experience in Hermanas Unidas. </span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.

What will you do to contribute to making UCSB a space where LGBTQ students feel safe in their communities, specifically in your college? </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collegiate Senators have duties specific to their college. For example, according to Legal Code, College of L&amp;S senators are supposed to meet with one of their college deans twice every quarter and the College of Engineering Senator is supposed to serve as a chair of the College of Engineering Student Council. Those are just two of the many duties assigned to collegiate senators. How has your past experience prepared you for this future task? </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do you think about the class sign up process on G.O.L.D.? In the past, students have recommended a shopping cart on G.O.L.D. where students could favorite classes they want to take before their pass times. Do you believe G.O.L.D. is currently a convenient way to choose your classes or could it be better?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB offers several on-campus resources that many students don’t even know about, such as the Collaborate Print Labs that offer 200 free prints a quarter. Name any on-campus resource that you believe students as a whole could learn about and perhaps take advantage of in the future. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this month, 13 graduate student workers reported that a man was seen walking in the hallways of the sociology department wearing a shirt with an antisemitic phrase. This incident was reported by the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and it shows that even on-campus education buildings are not immune to antisemitism. As a collegiate senator, how would you attempt to combat antisemitism and ensure that people from all backgrounds are heard, valued and respected? </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What would your first line of action be if you are elected? </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Responses to the issues presented by the questions, as well as candidates’ general goals, are summarized below:</span></p>\n<p><b>College of Engineering Candidates: </b></p>\n<p><b>Lim,</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a first-year chemical engineering major, believes that the greatest issue facing students in the College of Engineering is the stigma regarding mental health services. He said that, if elected, he wants to promote mental health awareness and wellness campaigns. Lim added that he is currently a part of the AIChE club at UCSB, which is a chemical engineering club; through that, he has experience in communicating with professors and students within his college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also wants to make a phone app geared toward S.T.E.M. and engineering students that would compile an inventory of different resources on campus that are “available to help people with their academic studies.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Reyes Carrillo, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a fourth-year computer science major, said the greatest issue facing students in her college is accessibility to certain technologies. If elected, Reyes Carrillo plans to advocate for lendable laptops and 3D printers. Reyes Carrillo also said that she believes the two-party system should not exist, which is why she chose to run independently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of how Reyes Carrillo would uplift the voices of LGBTQ students in her college, she mentioned the need for advocating for organizations such as oSTEM, which is an organization at UCSB aimed at promoting and supporting LGBTQ individuals in S.T.E.M. fields. Reyes Carrillo added that she believes the College of Engineering should have two senatorial seats. </span></p>\n<p><b>College of Letters and Science Candidates:</b></p>\n<p><b>Danielzadeh, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a second-year psychological and brain sciences major, said the greatest issue facing students in her college is over-enrollment. Danielzadeh wants to modify G.O.L.D. and update the waitlist system so that students with “upper standing who need certain classes to graduate on time have priority.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When meeting with the deans of the College of L&amp;S twice a quarter if elected, Danielzadeh hopes to “encourage the addition of new majors that are more fit with our current job market and what our generation is actually interested in.” Danielzadeh didn’t specify exactly which majors she would like added. She also wants to improve Campus Learning Assistive Services (C.L.A.S.) by offering one-on-one affordable tutoring for students. </span></p>\n<p><b>Campos, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a third-year sociology major, said the greatest issue facing students in the College of Letters &amp; Science is that the college does not have enough resources. Campos hopes to form a committee with honors students from different departments to “ensure that every student feels that their major concerns are being voiced.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, Campos also wants to find a solution regarding textbook affordability by working with department heads and administrators on campus to gain funding to expand course reserves in the library.</span></p>\n<p><b>Chocron,</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an undeclared second-year, also believes that awareness surrounding mental health is the biggest issue facing students in his college. Chocron mentioned his involvement in Hillel, the Public Safety Commission and the Interfraternity Council, citing his ability to work with a variety of groups at UCSB and in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding the recent instances of antisemitism at UCSB, Chocron said that one solution is to hold “open spaces where leaders on our campus are able to educate students on the issue and let them form their own response and come up with their own ideas as to how they feel and what they should do.” He Chocron then emphasized that one of his biggest platform points is to ensure the safety of students and faculty at UCSB; he also said that UCSB needs to do a better job of making sure that students and faculty are aware of emergency policies.</span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.
