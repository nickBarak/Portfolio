Riverside and Irvine finished the weekend with a conference record of 3-3 and 2-4.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The stage was set Friday as the Gauchos honored its three seniors Angelisa Cortez, Beth Ritter and Savannah Francis against 9-7-0 UC Riverside. UCSB put the first points on the board in the 8th minute as freshman forward Mallory Hromatko took a line drive pass from sophomore forward Amanda Ball launching a kick to the right side of the net. Senior goalkeeper Elizabeth Silas made a play on the ball but gave Hromatko just enough time to regain possession and sink a shot in the upper left corner.</p>\n<p>The Danville native’s goal gave her eight on the year, third place in the Big West and the most among any freshman. UCSB took a 1-0 lead after Hromatko’s score.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders responded with two goals of their own both in the second half by freshman defender Darielle O’Brien. O’Brien’s first goal came off a corner kick in the 55th minute that flew past a line of UCSB defenders into the top right of the net. Following this, the freshman defender beat her man off a cross from the left side. O’Brien made her way towards goal and punched a chip shot in a similar spot to her first goal.</p>\n<p>After freshman forward Jessica Parque set the equalizer in the 72nd minute, the two teams ended regulation with the score tied at two apiece.</p>\n<p>Heading into extra minutes, the Gauchos wasted no time in putting the match away. In the 104th minute Santa Barbara led an attack down the right flank as Ball set up sophomore midfielder Chase Schornstein for an easy game-winner. Schornstein’s goal to the bottom left corner marked her third score of the season and her first in conference play.</p>\n<p>“In this conference there is nothing easy,” said Head Coach Paul Stumpf. “[As a coaching staff] we know how hard these student athletes work. When they get rewarded for that effort and those final minutes, that has to be the most [satisfying] feeling for us.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos racked up seven corner kicks in their 3-2 victory along with 10 shots and three shots on target. Senior goalie Beth Ritter also made two in the 87th minute that kept her team locked at 2-2.</p>\n<p>Friday night couldn’t have ended on a more perfect note as this match was dedicated to the seniors on the team.</p>\n<p>“Our main [goal] was heading into the match winning it for our seniors, especially since our team hasn’t made it to the Big West Tournament since 2009,” said Hromatko. “Our seniors have never been there and as a team we wanted to give them that opportunity to get as many wins so that we could get into that tournament.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s last trip to the Big West Tournament ended in a 1-1 draw to Long Beach State in the conference finals. Stumpf is grateful his seniors’ drought without a Big West appearance will come to an end.</p>\n<p>“We punched our ticket to the tournament with today’s win. This group of seniors hasn’t made it to the Big West, so for the first time in a couple years they get the whole deal.”</p>\n<p>Following a hard fought win on Friday, the Gauchos had their work cut out for them facing a physical 6-9-1 UC Irvine team. The Anteaters headed into Sunday’s match coming off a 2-0 blowout on the road at Cal Poly. While their record did not show it, the Anteaters came prepared for a much bigger UCSB team in a game that could potentially knock them out of Big West contention.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters’ scrappiness proved to be a problem for the Gauchos as the majority of the first half was a battle for possession. Despite a season-high six corner kicks in the first half, all from junior midfielder Dakota Griggs, UCSB could not capitalize on their opportunities, heading into half with the score tied at zero.</p>\n<p>“I think we struggle with our second chances a lot,” said Griggs. “We get our head on it the first time but we need to do a better job getting [the ball] into a scoring position to make up for our second chances.”</p>\n<p>After a slow-paced second period, UCSB finally got the breakthrough it needed in the final minutes from none other than Hromatko.</p>\n<p>The freshman’s number was called in the 87th minute off a nice touch pass from Ball. Hromatko dribbled laterally past a group of defenders towards the middle of the penalty box. With her momentum drifting left and a swarm of defenders on her back Hromatko took a dead stop and shot a line drive down the middle to the lower left area of the goal. This late goal was all the Gauchos needed to take a 1-0 victory in dramatic fashion.</p>\n<p>“That was a great ball in by Amanda,” said Hromatko. “Our coaches were telling us to start connecting with each other more, so that was a great pass by her. I was able to feel a defender on my back and turn a shot on them since we only had a couple minutes left [in the game].”</p>\n<p>The Anteaters’ loss marks UCSB’s seventh shutout of the season. After its second straight weekend sweep, Santa Barbara looks to be in good shape heading to its final two matches against No. 1 ranked Cal State Fullerton and No. 4 ranked CSUN.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will resume action next Thursday, Oct. 29 in a 7 p.m. matchup against Fullerton. The match will be featured on ESPN 3. UCSB will wrap up conference play on Sunday against Northridge at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65784\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/ucsb-pushes-win-streak-to-four-with-wins-over-ucr-and-uci/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65784\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/ucsb-pushes-win-streak-to-four-with-wins-over-ucr-and-uci/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/ucsb-pushes-win-streak-to-four-with-wins-over-ucr-and-uci/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/ucsb-pushes-win-streak-to-four-with-wins-over-ucr-and-uci/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/ucsb-pushes-win-streak-to-four-with-wins-over-ucr-and-uci/","id":1488,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1487,1486,1485],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton","biography":"Not available","articles":[324,325,330,331,332,333,334,335,336,339,344,346,348,352,367,371,1387,1459,1460,1461,1466,1479,1480,1484,1488,1489,1499,1500,1503,1505,1506,1513,1524,1528,1529,1900,1959,1962,1976,1983,1988,1990,1995,3260,3281,3282,3303,3307,3324,3359],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Blue-Green Rivalry: Chapter Two","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The time has arrived!

We just have to fight and find a way to win.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Both sides are separated by just one point in the standings, with UCSB at 10-5-1 overall and 5-2 in Big West coming off a close win over UC Davis yesterday. The Mustangs picked up a big win themselves yesterday over Sac St. to stay just behind Santa Barbara at 9-3-3 overall and 4-1-2 in conference.</p>\n<p>For those who weren’t there last year when the Gauchos hosted the Mustangs in October 2014, the annual Blue-Green matchup drew an audience of 14,345 crazy fans, the second-largest campus crowd in NCAA history.</p>\n<p>That number could very well go even higher this time around, with both top-20 sides generating a high level of buzz so far this season.</p>\n<p>“That was a big part of my recruitment,” sophomore defender Fuad Adeniyi said. “I’ve been dreaming about playing in front of [large crowds], especially our fans, who we all know and love. They all pump us up for the game. It’s really, really good playing in front of them.”</p>\n<p>Expectations were high for the Gauchos coming into the year after having finished with a No. 1 seed in each of the past two seasons, and they have not disappointed in 2015.</p>\n<p>Junior Nick DePuy hasn’t been able to stay out of the headlines over the past year, currently leading the nation in game-winning goals with seven and ranking second overall with 12.</p>\n<p>That’s not too bad of a stat line for a player that didn’t even play forward until midway through his sophomore season.</p>\n<p>DePuy isn’t the only Gaucho making noise in the stat department this season. Freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong has been absolutely crucial for his team, tied for the Big West lead in assists with seven in just his freshman year while picking up a point in eight of the Gauchos’ last 11 games.</p>\n<p>Despite a perfect 4-0 start to conference play, the Big West has since learned that UCSB is most certainly not unbeatable. A terribly disappointing 5-2 loss at Sac St. last Wednesday ended a five-game winning streak for Santa Barbara just three days before it suffered its second straight loss at Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Those two losses were not all negative for UCSB, however, as they saw the return of junior left back Ismaila Jome. After missing nearly eight full games with an ankle sprain, the former Big West Freshman of the Year showed just how important he is by scoring in each of his first two games back.</p>\n<p>“I think the losses affected us in a good way,” sophomore left back Randy Mendoza said. “We were on a high when we were 4-0, and I think it’s making us hungry and realize that nothing is going to be given to us.”</p>\n<p>Defensive issues have become somewhat of a plague for the Gauchos since the beginning of Big West play. Through their first six conference games, they conceded 11 goals, just one less than the conference’s worst defenses over that span.</p>\n<p>Leading the UCSB defense is a player who is no stranger to the Blue-Green rivalry in goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg, son of long-time UCSB Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg.</p>\n<p>The freshman, who has spent time playing for the US men’s national soccer team (USMNT) U-20 squads, has had a solid year, going 10-4 as a starter and ranking fifth in the conference in goals against average at 1.32.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been in the stands for quite a few [UCSB-Cal Poly games] — some wins, some losses,” the younger Vom Steeg said. “It’s a real emotional game.”</p>\n<p>With three games still to play this season, the Mustangs have already surpassed their mark of eight wins in 2014.</p>\n<p>It’s no surprise that Cal Poly has been able to turn things around this year behind first year head coach Steve Sampson, who boasts an incredible resume that few coaches at this level, if any, could rival.</p>\n<p>Sampson has coached at virtually every competitive level, leading Santa Clara to a national championship in 1989, managing the US Men’s National Team in the 1998 World Cup, leading the Costa Rican national team to its highest ever FIFA world ranking of 17 in 2004 and winning both the U.S. Open Cup and MLS Cup in 2004 with the Los Angeles Galaxy.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs have lost just one game out of their last nine, picking up their biggest win of the year just five days ago at home against UCSB.</p>\n<p>After a thrilling first half in which both teams notched two goals, a sold-out crowd of 11,075 was forced to wait until the 104th minute before Cal Poly’s junior defender Kody Wakasa scored his first career goal on a corner kick, sending UCSB to its second straight Big West loss and bringing Cal Poly just one point out of first.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos managed to dominate in the shot department, outshooting the Mustangs 23-12, but Cal Poly’s senior goalkeeper Wade Hamilton was able to make seven big saves to help his team to victory.<br>\nHamilton currently sits at second in the Big West with a 1.01 goals against average.</p>\n<p>“Saturday was really tough. I thought we deserved to win and with seven minutes left they score off a corner kick. It was a pretty crazy environment,” Justin Vom Steeg said. “I’m really looking forward to this Saturday to get some revenge and hopefully we can show them up with a big victory in front of our home crowd.”</p>\n<p>The large audience tied for the 12th largest regular season crowd in NCAA history, but will likely be even bigger this Saturday at Harder Stadium, which seats 17,000. The Blue-Green rivalry is considered the greatest rivalry in college soccer for a reason, as evidenced by the fact that the two sides have provided 12 of the 18 largest audiences in college soccer since 1980.</p>\n<p>Looking at how the two teams have fared against one another over the years, UCSB has come away with the advantage at 45-18-7. However, the Mustangs have done well to flip the script in recent years, outdueling the Gauchos to the tune of a 4-3-2 record through their last nine meetings.</p>\n<p>While many Gaucho supporters are looking at this storied rivalry’s upcoming installment as a chance for revenge, Jome summed up his team’s mindset in two words: “Just win.” Regardless of all the hype, statistics and big names involved in this game, we’ll just have to wait for Saturday to see what happens.</p>\n<p>The second Blue-Green rivalry matchup of 2015 will kick off at 7 p.m. this Saturday at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 13 of October 22, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65601\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/blue-green-rivalry-chapter-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65601\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/blue-green-rivalry-chapter-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/blue-green-rivalry-chapter-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/blue-green-rivalry-chapter-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/blue-green-rivalry-chapter-2/","id":1487,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1486,1485,1484],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 19 UCSB Downs UC Davis in First of Crucial Three-Game Homestand","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Soccer-v-UC-Irvine-Big-West-Semis-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7097.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Soccer-v-UC-Irvine-Big-West-Semis-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7097.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"One down, three to go before the conclusion of the 2015 regular season.

UCSB is now 10-5-1 overall and 5-2 in conference, while the Aggies, who had gone undefeated in four straight, fall four points out of first at 7-7-2 overall, 3-2-2 Big West.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Playing without junior midfielder Josue Espana, who was suspended after picking up two yellow cards in UCSB’s game last Saturday at Cal Poly, the Gauchos struggled to find a flow on their offensive half.</p>\n<p>“Josue has started and played basically every minute for us and he controls the middle of our field. That made a huge difference,” Vom Steeg said. “Without him in the game, we were lost.”</p>\n<p>Fortunately for the Gauchos, a pair of crucial mistakes by Davis defenders cost them the game.</p>\n<p>After controlling the game through the first 15 minutes, midfielder Seo-In Kim brought the ball down the right flank before sophomore defender Greg Salazar’s attempted clearance came right back down off Kim’s arm. The junior transfer from Duke quickly recovered the ball before sending in a cross, ironically coming off of Salazar’s arm this time and resulting in a UCSB penalty.</p>\n<p>“There are referees where literally no matter what happens on the field, they’re not going to call it,” Vom Steeg said. “The referee tonight will call PKs. Definitely the arm was stretched, so I thought that first one was a good PK call.”</p>\n<p>It was Feucht who stepped up to take the penalty for the Gauchos, as he did against Cal State Fullerton in UCSB’s last home outing 11 days prior. The German showed great composure from the spot, seeming to hesitate at the last moment before taking the shot. After seeing Davis redshirt junior goalkeeper Armando Quezada go left, Feucht calmly slotted the ball into the right corner, giving the Gauchos an early 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>“The first half we were moving so well. It was just a matter of time,” Kim said. “Fortunately, we got a cross and [Salazar] handballed it, and Kevin of course is going to tuck it away.”</p>\n<p>Following a solid first 20 minutes of play, UCSB was unable to establish any kind of offensive flow for the rest of the first half. As the second half kicked off, momentum quickly turned the Aggies’ way, as they forced turnovers in the Gauchos’ defensive third and came close to scoring on a number of occasions.</p>\n<p>Davis finally found an equalizer in the 74<sup>th</sup> minute off a long throw into the box. A scramble for the ball resulted in a poor defensive clearance from just in front of goal and junior defender Steven Guzman capitalized, lobbing a header over freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg from about eight yards out to tie the game at 1-1.</p>\n<p>“In general, I thought we did decent [defending] the throw in,” Vom Steeg said. “But you put enough bodies inside the six yard box and bounce it around and do it 15 times… I hope everybody knows it’s not really soccer.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies’ unorthodox attacking methods brought them level with UCSB, but not for long. Just 70 seconds after the equalizer, junior forward Nick DePuy beat his defender in the box before being dragged down by a reckless tackle from senior defender/midfielder Lucas Mohageg, awarding UCSB its second penalty of the night.</p>\n<p>“Nick did a good job of dropping his shoulder and getting in front of [Mohageg],” Vom Steeg said. “As a defender at that point, I’d let him go a little bit, but the minute Nick got in front and the defender now is trying to save the day with a tackle, I would say around the world that one gets called.”</p>\n<p>Once again, it was Feucht stepping up to put the Gauchos up by one, this time firing it into the left corner with no hesitation while Quezada dove to the right post. That would be the high moment of the game for Feucht, who celebrated with a spectacular flip after notching his fourth goal for UCSB in as many games.</p>\n<p>From there, the Gauchos were able to hold on for the 2-1 victory, but they suffered another huge loss before the game was over. With just 4:33 remaining, a free kick that was awarded to Davis was delayed when Feucht kicked the ball away, resulting in his fifth yellow card of the season.</p>\n<p>This means that UCSB will be without its best holding midfielder for an even more crucial matchup with second place Cal Poly this Saturday.</p>\n<p>“The reason why it feels like a loss is because we did lose [Feucht] tonight on a fifth yellow,” Vom Steeg said. “We seem to make mistakes that really hurt us, and that’s obviously a mistake because there was no point. Now you’ve got two days to redo all your set pieces and your defensive marking because you’ve got to drop a new player in.”</p>\n<p>Already facing the challenges of fatigue, injuries, and a top-20 ranked Cal Poly team that just beat UCSB 3-2 in double overtime last Saturday, Feucht’s suspension could not have come at a worse time.</p>\n<p>“It’s really hard for me to walk in and scream, yell and get animated when the reality is the guys are giving you everything they have. At some point you just get tired,” Vom Steeg said. “You’re now deep into the bench. It’s why we carry 28 players and you’ll have to see a bunch of them Saturday.”</p>\n<p>Despite his frustrations after a grueling contest, Vom Steeg was still able to find one silver lining.</p>\n<p>“At least, good news, Josue will be fresh,” he said with a smile.</p>\n<p>The Blue-Green rivalry game will be played for the second time in seven days this Saturday at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>The Aggies will get their shot at revenge against the Gauchos in both team’s regular season finale at Davis on Halloween.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65687\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/no-20-ucsb-downs-uc-davis-in-first-of-crucial-three-game-homestand/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65687\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/no-20-ucsb-downs-uc-davis-in-first-of-crucial-three-game-homestand/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/no-20-ucsb-downs-uc-davis-in-first-of-crucial-three-game-homestand/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/no-20-ucsb-downs-uc-davis-in-first-of-crucial-three-game-homestand/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/no-20-ucsb-downs-uc-davis-in-first-of-crucial-three-game-homestand/","id":1485,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1484,1483,1482],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Classic Blue-Green Rivalry Game Ends in 2-2 Tie","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mens_Soccer_SLO_10.24_Eric_Swenson_024-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mens_Soccer_SLO_10.24_Eric_Swenson_024-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Instant classic.

Eric Swenson/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>This past Saturday, the Blue-Green rivalry between the No. 18 UCSB men’s soccer team and No. 22 Cal Poly delivered an absolute classic in front of nearly 15,000 fans in attendance and thousands more viewers on Fox Sports Prime Ticket. Unfortunately for the Gauchos, a 2-0 first half lead was not enough to avenge a 3-2 loss to the Mustangs seven days prior, as the road side was able to find an equalizer with just four seconds left in regulation to send the game to an eventual 2-2 tie.</p>\n<p>Despite the result, UCSB still remains in first place in the Big West North at 10-5-2 overall and 5-2-1 in conference. Cal Poly continues to linger just a point out of first with a record of 9-3-4 overall, 4-1-3 Big West.</p>\n<p>“We were four seconds from winning the game, so obviously, it’s a disappointed locker room,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We played a good first half, we got the two goals, I thought our defense was the best they’ve been all year. The frustration is that when you do a lot of the right things, hopefully the guys are rewarded at the end of the day.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The 14,919 members in the audience now take over last year’s Blue-Green game for the second largest campus crowd in NCAA history. Since 1980, 13 of the 19 largest crowds have been UCSB-Cal Poly matchups, with the largest ever (15,896) being when UCSB hosted UCLA back in 2010.</p>\n<p>The final seconds of regulation seemed to move in slow motion as the Gaucho faithful waited patiently for the clock to reach zero. With time running out, Cal Poly’s senior defender Kip Colvey sent in a cross towards the far post where senior forward Matt Lagrassa, who had been winning headers all night, rose above a UCSB defender to place a shot on goal, forcing freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg to make a remarkable one-handed save.</p>\n<p>“I could tell [Lagrassa] was going to head it to the far side. The ground is a little sloppy on that side of the field so I lost my footing a little bit but I was fortunate to get a hand out,” the younger Vom Steeg said. “To be honest I thought I should’ve done a little better with it, but with plays like that it happens pretty quickly, and when you have the ball bouncing around the six-yard box, you usually get punished.”</p>\n<p>The ball eventually fell to freshman forward Jared Pressley right inside the six-yard box, who scored a goal that will be remembered for years to come into the open net. It was just the second goal of his career.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZK2nP8X_W6o?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>“We’ve made this repeated mistake when balls get played into the box where we get stuck watching while the attacking player just keeps going forward,” Vom Steeg said. “That back post head ball is probably where [sophomore forward Kevin Feucht] would’ve been. It’s unfortunate because it takes away from a really good effort all night.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos dominated the game from the outset, looking comfortable playing in the spotlight of a much-hyped, televised game between two teams widely accepted to have the greatest rivalry in college soccer. It took little more than 10 minutes for them to open the scoring, as freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong pounced on a loose ball in the attacking third to set up for the cross.</p>\n<p>After not scoring in seven consecutive games, sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani was found making a near post run to tap it in with his favored left foot, giving UCSB the early advantage.</p>\n<p>With fatigue and injuries forcing Vom Steeg to utilize his bench early and often, he was rewarded in the 43<sup>rd</sup> minute when freshman forward Cody Gibson played it in from the right wing to find a sky-high Nick DePuy. The junior forward outjumped his defender, placing a perfect header towards the far post and past Cal Poly senior goalkeeper Wade Hamilton to give UCSB a huge 2-0 advantage heading into halftime.</p>\n<p>“Physically, they could just not stay with [our forwards]. That’s where the gameplan was,” Vom Steeg said. “I asked Ahinga to start making his near post run, he hasn’t made it in the last five games. He made the run, and we got two good services.”</p>\n<p>The goal was DePuy’s Big West-leading 13<sup>th</sup> of the season.</p>\n<p>Things changed in the second half with the Gauchos facing the dilemma of sitting back or going for a third goal to put the game away. With Cal Poly sending men forward for the remainder of the game, UCSB eventually got punished on the break.</p>\n<p>In the 73<sup>rd</sup> minute, junior defender Jack O’Connor was all by himself down the left side, sending in a cross towards an unmarked Chase Minter in the box. The senior forward/midfielder put away a solid strike, giving him his fifth goal of the year and cutting the deficit in half.</p>\n<p>“We all know that Minter is a very good player. We all know that we need to not get beat out wide,” Vom Steeg said. “We’ve spent the last two weeks working on finding men in the box, and if you’re going to leave anyone open, don’t leave their best player, that’s a pretty simple rule. We didn’t find him and it was a good finish.”</p>\n<p>From there, two overtime periods yielded few chances before a final corner kick by Acheampong hit the post as time expired. The result was the second consecutive 2-2 tie between the two teams at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>“A lot of positive things that our team did tonight. Again, I feel bad for the players to be not going home tonight having won the game,” Vom Steeg said. “We are in first place and that is a top-20 RPI team, so we didn’t do anything bad tonight, but that’s going in my fourth column of games that we left out there this season. Hopefully we’ll learn and be here in a playoff situation saying we figured out with ten seconds left how to clear a ball.”</p>\n<p>It’s never fun to dwell on what-if scenarios, but had the Gauchos not lost Feucht, their best holding midfielder, to a suspension on yellow card accumulation, they may have been able to hold on in a game like this. In the German’s place, senior right back Duncan Backus, who Vom Steeg named the man of the match, stepped in to do a phenomenal job in an unfamiliar center defensive midfielder role.</p>\n<p>“I’m just happy that the coaches put the trust in me to play a position,” Backus said. “The main thing was just defend, work hard, connect my passes and get the ball to the dangerous guys that can go do damage. I just made sure that we aren’t missing Kevin too much.”</p>\n<p>If these two teams play each other again in the Big West Tournament, we can expect an even crazier atmosphere than the ones we’ve witnessed in the past two weeks.</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos is a rematch against Sacramento St. on Wednesday at home.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65783\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/classic-blue-green-rivalry-game-ends-in-2-2-tie/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65783\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/classic-blue-green-rivalry-game-ends-in-2-2-tie/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/classic-blue-green-rivalry-game-ends-in-2-2-tie/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/classic-blue-green-rivalry-game-ends-in-2-2-tie/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/classic-blue-green-rivalry-game-ends-in-2-2-tie/","id":1486,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1485,1484,1483],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
