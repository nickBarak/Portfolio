\r\n</script> \n<p>Both fans and media personalities questioned whether or not the Warriors would even make the Finals, believing that they had lost the series against the Houston Rockets the moment Durant went down with his injury.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Warriors relied on their star point guard who would drop 33 points, all in the second half of Game 6, to put away the Rockets and advance to the Conference Finals.</p>\n<p>Yet, even after Curry’s Game 6 performance, many doubted he could lead the Warriors past the scorching Portland Trailblazers who upset both the media favorite Oklahoma City Thunder and second seed Denver Nuggets.</p>\n<p>NBA Hall of Famer and TNT Analyst Charles Barkley predicted that the Trailblazers would make the Finals, and even went as far to say “the Warriors have no chance of winning without Kevin Durant.”</p>\n<p>Curry’s legacy has been in question since Durant joined the Warriors, which caused his scoring to take a minor drop.</p>\n<p>As such, analysts and fans believed that Curry’s time as the greatest point guard in the NBA has gone, having been surpassed by Kyrie Irving, Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook, to name a few.</p>\n<p>To silence his naysayers, Curry played monstrously in the Conference Finals averaging 36.5 points per game along with 8.3 rebounds and 7.3 assists in a 4-0 series rout of the Blazers to reach the NBA Finals.</p>\n<p>The Warriors will be in the Finals for the fifth straight time being only the second team to do so, since the Boston Celtics, led by Bill Russell, did back in the ‘60s.</p>\n<p>Curry has played the previous four, but has never won an NBA Finals MVP. While Curry has mentioned that he prefers to win the championship over the award, it’s precisely his lack of a Finals MVP that people question his legacy.</p>\n<p>With Durant out for the first game and possibly the second (or longer), it’s up to Steph Curry to once again carry the load and remind the rest of the NBA why he was the first to ever be awarded MVP unanimously.</p>\n<p>This is Curry’s opportunity to showcase his offensive arsenal and prove to the world that the Warriors are still his team.</p>\n<p>Curry has a chance to once and for all shut up his critics, and claim the award that’s rightfully his.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Between Leonard, Lowry, Curry and Thompson, the NBA Finals has more than enough all-stars to keep an eye on this Thursday. Besides these players and the rest of the Raptors’ and Warriors’ starting lineups, however, is a bench full of players equally crucial to securing a championship ring.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, the Toronto Raptors have been known for having a deep bench and relying heavily on rotations. But, as we know, this year is not like the rest for the Canadian franchise. As showcased in the Eastern conference finals, Coach Nick Nurse has stuck to a steady eight-man rotation, which includes Fred VanVleet, Serge Ibaka and Norman Powell.</p>\n<p>Most outstandingly, the trio’s combined 48 points during Game 4 against the Bucks attests to their newfound place in the Raptors’ lineup. Powell and VanVleet make up the first- and second-highest marks in three-point shooters off the bench in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>Since the birth of his second child prior to Game Four, VanVleet’s performance has improved greatly. Coincidence or not, his average three-point percentage over Games 4, 5 and 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals stands at 85.9% —  significantly higher than it’s been all season — going 3-3, 7-9 and 4-5, respectively. His recent success may even open up a spot for him as starting point guard in the upcoming finals.</p>\n<p>Serge Ibaka’s defensive game has been consistent for the Raptors come postseason. With his steady inside coverage, mobility and acute eye for rebounds, the 6’10” center can be very useful going against a strong offensive team like the Warriors.</p>\n<p>Norman Powell’s minutes and shooting percentage from the field have nearly doubled since the conference semifinals back in the beginning of the month. Powell will enter the NBA Finals this Thursday on a hot streak after marking a lofty 74 points during the Eastern Conference Finals — a tremendous improvement to the mere 21 points he tallied in the semifinals.</p>\n<p>As for Golden State, their bench remains a bit more unpredictable. After a calf injury took out Kevin Durant back against the Rockets, the Warriors have had to lean on their bench more than anticipated this postseason. Now giving more starting time to players like Kevon Looney, Coach Steve Kerr relies more heavily on bench rotations; consequently, Alfonzo McKinnie, Jonas Jerebko and Shaun Livingston have been spending more time on the court.</p>\n<p>In the conference finals against Portland, McKinnie really stepped up his game. Though inconsistent throughout the majority of regular and postseason, McKinnie’s shot has gradually become more reliable, scoring 12 points in Game 4 versus Portland — the most he’s racked since nearly October.</p>\n<p>The star of the Warriors second unit so far however has been center Kevon Looney.</p>\n<p>Looney has been a stabilizing force on both sides of the ball, gobbling up rebounds and finishing at the rim like an elite big man. His matchup with Marc Gasol will be pivotal, and if he continues to play with the intensity he had last year the Warriors will be in good position to win.</p>\n<p>It may be, though, that ultimately the Raptors have the edge when it comes to their bench. Equipped with three key players who have demonstrated their ability to compete and change games at the very least threatens the defending champs.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5f0ad4d38c0da837cc79f764e12b16e5?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5f0ad4d38c0da837cc79f764e12b16e5?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/leonard-paulasa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Leonard Paulasa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Staff writer and photographer.

A quarter of the way through, a kill by UCI’s Aaron Koubi brought his side the first significant lead of the match, with a 9-5 score favoring the Anteaters. Following this point, the Gauchos seemed to flip the script and fought back. Eventually, off a kill by Gaucho outside hitter Ryan Wilcox, UCSB tied the point tally at 15-apiece. For the remainder of the set, it was truly neck and neck, with no side gaining a lead greater than three points. Although it seemed likely that the Gauchos would take this set late, the hosts prevailed by a final score of 29-27.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dropping that last set must have been quite demoralizing for the Gauchos, because the following set proved to be the team’s worst of the whole series versus Irvine. With the Gauchos not being able to find their defensive bearings in this one, the set would favor the home side once more, resulting in a 25-12 final score. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third and final set of the night saw a bit more energy from the Gauchos, as the good guys kept it close and competitive once more. However, the Anteaters were stingy with their lead in this one and managed a hard-fought 25-22 victory, and the first night went to UCI with a final set score of 3-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday night, it was UCI’s turn to travel, as UCSB hosted its last regular season match. The Gauchos were likely seeking redemption but couldn’t find it in the first set. Although closely matched in the beginning, it was around when the point tally reached 13-8, off a kill by UCI’s Karl Apfelbach, that the visitors began to run away with this one. Although a service ace from Gaucho outside hitter Corey Chavers brought the tally back within five at 21-16, the Anteaters went on to secure the first set of night two with a final score of 25-17 [[ok]].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The major bright spot of the series for the Gauchos came in this second set as UCSB fought hard to earn and maintain its lead. The Anteaters didn’t make this an easy task; however, UCSB’s fight paid off as the home side was victorious by a 25-22 tally.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the third set, it appeared the Gauchos were in a good position to snag back-to-back sets. Still, the hosts were in catch-up mode for the majority of it. A service error on UCI’s behalf did, however, bring it back within one at 19-18. Nevertheless, the Gauchos couldn’t muster up a comeback in time and dropped the third set by a 25-21 result.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fourth and final set arguably wrapped the series up on a high note, as a total of 66 points were tallied by its end. It was truly the epitome of back and forth, neck and neck, in this one, with the lead never surpassing more than two points. Ultimately, the Anteaters took this one, too, by a final score of 34-32 — meaning the final set score also went to the visitors, at 3-1.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This regular season finale was also the senior night for Corey Chavers, Connor Drake and Hayden Boehle, who were all recognized in their last home game at Robertson Gymnasium.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up next for the Gauchos is the Big West Volleyball Championship. Although these past two defeats dropped UCSB down a spot in the seeding, the Gauchos will be facing a CSUN side whom they’ve bested twice by set scores of 3-0 and 3-2, back in late March.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will face CSUN in Hawai’i this Thursday, April 18, at 7:30 p.m.    </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87499\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-16/gauchos-drop-to-fourth-seed-in-big-west-after-falling-to-uc-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87499\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-16/gauchos-drop-to-fourth-seed-in-big-west-after-falling-to-uc-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-16/gauchos-drop-to-fourth-seed-in-big-west-after-falling-to-uc-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-16/gauchos-drop-to-fourth-seed-in-big-west-after-falling-to-uc-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-16/gauchos-drop-to-fourth-seed-in-big-west-after-falling-to-uc-irvine/","id":1155,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1154,1153,1152],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Breanna Stewart Tragedy","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2019-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/BreannaStewart_foulshot-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/BreannaStewart_foulshot-1.jpg?resize=709%2C647&ssl=1","description":"I am personally responsible for Breanna Stewart tearing her Achilles over the weekend in the EuroLeague title game.

After leading her Russian team Dynamo Kursk to the title game, Stewart rolled up on fellow WNBA star Britney Griner, rupturing her Achilles in the process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just months prior, Stewart had experienced one of the highs of her young career, lifting the WNBA championship trophy for the first time as the Seattle Storm swept the Washington Mystics, earning finals MVP in the process. During the regular season, Stewart averaged 21.8 ppg and 8.4 rpg en-route to earn league MVP honors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, because she played in a game that a player of her caliber should not have to play in to make a decent living, Stewart loses a valuable year of her prime, the Seattle Storm lose their superstar for the season and the WNBA loses one of their most marketable players.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, all because of a devastating injury that should never have occurred.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How is it possible that the MVP of the premier women’s basketball league in the world doesn’t make more than $56,000? It starts with a faulty collective bargaining agreement (CBA) — one that can, should and will likely change in the coming years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When WNBA players complain about their salary in comparison to their male counterparts, they don’t expect to get equal pay; obviously, the men’s game makes more money. No, what they want is a similar share of the profits. In the NBA, 50 percent of the total money is allocated to player salaries; in the WNBA, that number hovers around 20 percent. Double Stewart’s salary, and maybe she wouldn’t have to play overseas — instead opting to give her body a much deserved rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that doesn’t explain the whole story, including why the WNBA has consistently lost money over the past 10 years. For that, I blame myself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve always tried to advocate for women’s basketball; as a 12-year-old, I vividly remember writing in my journal, trying to make a successful marketing plan for the WNBA. What I failed to understand as a young, naive kid was the nature of the main force holding the WNBA back: sexism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve all heard the common arguments made by men against women’s basketball: it’s boring, the women can’t dunk and,“I’m a waaaay better basketball player than these women.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last point especially pisses me off, because it manifests itself even in pickup basketball. One of my best friends plays pickup with me weekly, and every time she makes a shot, the game always stops for a minute so everybody can clap and congratulate her. In reality, she’s played more minutes of organized basketball than they ever will in their lives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, I had the privilege of beat-writing for the UCSB women’s basketball team, and I saw first-hand the skill, effort and tactics that went into a game. I will guarantee that freshman point guard Danae Miller could cross over anyone I know, regardless of gender.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the first two arguments, women’s basketball may be played below the rim, but that makes it no less exciting to hoop nerds like myself. Because there is less reliance on raw athleticism, WNBA players are some of the craftiest finishers around the rim. And in stark contrast to the men’s game, the women’s game relies much less on the three-pointer, which is very refreshing to watch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, back to my opening sentence: I blame myself because I haven’t done nearly enough to combat this sexism. Yes, I tell my friends they’re dead wrong when they say they can beat women in one-on-ones, but that shouldn’t be seen as an accomplishment.

Both Kevin Durant, known as KD, and DeMarcus Cousins, known as Boogie, went down with a calf strain and a torn left quadricep, respectively, while Andre Iguodala has been dealing with a calf injury as well.</p>\n<p>When Durant in particular went down with his injury in game five of the second round of the playoffs, hope was at an all-time low amongst the Golden State Warriors fans when it came to the prospect of winning their third-straight championship. Fast forward two weeks, the narrative has now shifted to “The Warriors don’t need KD.”</p>\n<p>How have the Warriors been able to win without their big guns? There are a couple players that have kept them on the right track.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Stephen Curry. After KD’s injury, Curry has averaged 36 points, seven assists and eight rebounds per game. More impressively, he is shooting 47% from the field, including 41% from behind the three point line.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons why Steph has been able to play at this high of a level is because he is constantly moving without the ball. As soon as he crosses half court, he swings the ball to one side and immediately goes to the other.</p>\n<p>Once on the other side, he comes off of a couple screens, similar to how a running back follows his blockers. This has made it difficult for opposing teams to guard Curry, as their primary defender at the beginning of the play is never the one that is guarding him one-on-one toward the end of the shot clock. Usually, it is a power forward or center that is forced to switch onto him, giving Curry a tremendous advantage.</p>\n<p>The second player, who has had arguably the most impact on the team during this run, is Draymond Green. Green is averaging 15 points, eight assists and 11 rebounds in his last five games. More importantly, he has been the anchor on the defensive end of the floor, whether that be drawing charges or contesting shots.</p>\n<p>Golden State is starting to revert back to their fast-paced style, which led to a 73-9 record in the regular season just two years ago, prior to the arrival of KD and Boogie. It is clear that their confidence is growing and that the older members are trying to prove that they can still win despite the injuries the team has suffered.</p>\n<p>If  Durant and Cousins do end up returning at some point in the NBA finals, it will be important for Head Coach Steve Kerr to continue to push this fast paced offense.</p>\n<p>This style of play allows players such as Klay Thompson to be not only more involved in the game plan, but also remain engaged throughout the game.</p>\n<p>While it is a luxury to have isolation scorers such as KD, it should not change the strategy that has been working recently. The Warriors are harder to guard now because every player on the floor is either moving without the ball or setting screens for their teammates.</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to watch whether the Warriors play a different style if their star players return in time during the finals. That being said, Curry and Draymond will look to send a message to the league that their squad is more than capable of winning the finals regardless.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The Toronto Raptors have fallen behind in each series they’ve played so far during these playoffs and have been forced to dig deep into their bag in order to successfully pull each one out (maybe the Orlando series wasn’t that tough, but you get what I’m saying).</p>\n<p>Whether they were tasked with disrupting Joel Embiid or Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nick Nurse’s squad has adjusted well and relied on their defense to lead them to victory.</p>\n<p>The Raptors are led offensively by the future Hall-of-Famer Kawhi Leonard, but at points throughout the playoffs some of their main scorers and playmakers have shown their inexperience (Pascal Siakam) or shown that they are Kyle Lowry (Kyle Lowry).</p>\n<p>Marc Gasol is also no longer the dominant offensive presence that he once was, and guys like Danny Green and Fred VanVleet are not the kind of multifaceted threats that can consistently make a difference in the playoffs. It is in times like these that Nurse’s squad must rely on their lengthy and disciplined defense to propel them to win.</p>\n<p>The defensive dominance of the Raptors’ playoff run can easily be characterized by their opponents’ shooting percentages, as they have allowed the second lowest field goal percentage (41.7%) and the third-lowest three-point percentage (31.3%) out of all the playoff teams.</p>\n<p>Interestingly however, they have allowed the fourth-highest percentage of three-point shots to be taken against them (40.5%). These stats put together show that Toronto is exceptional at forcing teams out of shots near the hoop and making them take bad, highly contested shots from behind the arc. This is a strategy that worked wonders for them against Milwaukee, as their length bothered Antetokounmpo on his drives and forced him to  kick the ball out to shooters at the three-point line, who were then forced to shoot under duress as the Raptors’ length also allowed them to recover and contest those shots.</p>\n<p>Toronto’s exceptional defense has only improved in the playoffs, as their 102.8 defensive rating through 18 postseason games is sizeably better than their 107.1 regular season defensive rating.</p>\n<p>This is most likely due to the fact that Nurse has cut down his rotation to only his most productive players, and also because Leonard is now playing every game, which he did not do throughout the regular season.</p>\n<p>The Raptors have been known for having a strong bench with a deep rotation of quality players, but throughout this season and aided by the Marc Gasol trade, it has been the starting lineup that has set the tone on the defensive end.</p>\n<p>In fact, the starting lineup of Leonard, Gasol, Green, Lowry and Pascal Siakam has a playoff defensive rating of 99.7 over 314 minutes played. This is the only five-man unit of the playoffs to have a defensive rating under 100 and have over 200 minutes played. Since this unit has been on the floor for over 300 minutes, it has allowed the Raptors to achieve sustained dominance over the course of several grueling playoff series.</p>\n<p>Defense will be key against one of the best offensive teams ever — Golden State — and with KD likely missing time early in the series, the Raps might have the personnel to slow down the Splash Brothers and make this series interesting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88770\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/nba-finals-preview-warriors-offense-vs-raptors-defense/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88770\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/nba-finals-preview-warriors-offense-vs-raptors-defense/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/nba-finals-preview-warriors-offense-vs-raptors-defense/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/nba-finals-preview-warriors-offense-vs-raptors-defense/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/nba-finals-preview-warriors-offense-vs-raptors-defense/","id":1156,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[1155,1154,1153],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
