class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lafayette emphasized the importance of nonviolent resistance, having worked closely with Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. </span><em>Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Feb. 20, Lafayette, a prominent figure in the civil rights movement, came to UC Santa Barbara to talk to the student body about how to live as conscious citizens in a world shaped by the actions of social activists.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The discussion, titled “An Evening with Dr. Bernard Lafayette Jr.: Nonviolence in a Time of Civil Unrest,” was organized by the Associated Students Program Board and marked Lafayette’s first visit to the university.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most associated with the Freedom Riders and later the Selma Voting Rights movement, Lafayette emphasized the importance of nonviolent resistance, having worked closely with Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Diane Nash and James Bevel in the American Civil Rights Movement.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1967, King even offered Lafayette a position as the program director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the Nexus before the lecture, Lafayette went into detail regarding his experiences as a political organizer and a protester, working with the Nashville Student Movement, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the SCLC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also lamented traits that he said he has seen in some present-day social movements and activists, such as a tendency to focus on the problems themselves rather than proposed solutions, as well as an inability to look at their activism from a broader perspective.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Present-day activists] need to reexamine to see whether or not they’re taking everything into consideration. And whether or not they’re benefiting also from the laws enacted, changed and whether or not they are harmful to themselves or harmful to others as well,” Lafayette said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Public policy is very much related to what people expect and expectations from constituencies that are involved … they can’t look at it from a narrow, narrow view. Unfortunately, people sometimes make decisions [solely] based on their own ethnic identity or political affiliation,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also noted that the arrival of advanced technology, such as the internet, has allowed people who share similar values and ways of thinking to establish forums and foster vibrant communities of activists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media, for instance, changed the playing field in regards to how opinions, personal musings and even breaking news is communicated to and amongst the masses, Lafayette said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[With social media] you can communicate with large numbers of people,” he said. “We didn’t have that. We had to use little simple methods and depend so much on the public media.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building a relationship with the media, however, still remains an incredibly important thing to do, Lafayette said. He added that the media is the party that will project a social movement to the broader public.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s how we were able to accomplish the things that we accomplished, because we learned how to deal with the media. Part of the whole movement is to reach the masses of people … you need to pay special attention to maintain and sustain a movement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The media is [still] important … you have to learn how to maintain communication with the media in such a way that your movement is able to continue,” Lafayette said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Lafayette recalled his experience as one of the original Freedom Riders, civil rights activists who protested segregated buses in the South by riding interstate buses from Washington, D.C. to New Orleans in mixed-race groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Freedom Riders were arrested in Jackson, Mississippi, Lafayette said he and his companions were able to create more publicity for their movement when they were taken into police custody. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Rather than [make bail] and continue on to New Orleans, we decided to stay in jail a longer period of time. We stayed in jail to prolong the movement,” Lafayette said, adding that “as a result of this, we had [people from] about 11 different countries come to the U.S.” to express solidarity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As he began his talk, Lafayette started to discuss lineage, speaking to the crowd about his formative years growing up in the Tampa, Florida area, as well as his Afro-Caribbean and French roots. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the talk, Lafayette focused on the distinction between successful and unsuccessful social movements, asking, “What are some of the techniques and strategies that are actually applicable universally?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The easiest answer to this, according to Lafayette, is also the simplest: disciplined nonviolence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He attributed the significance of civil disobedience to its ability to invalidate unjust laws without resorting to acts of violence. In particular, Lafayette emphasized the importance of accepting the legal consequences of civil disobedience in order to lend weight to one’s argument.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What you don’t want to do is behave the same way the others behave. If you’re gonna bring about change, you have to change yourself first,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You must only accept the consequences. That was the most important lesson I learned,” Lafayette said. “You have to be willing to accept the consequences when you refuse to obey an unjust law because the law is [supposed] to determine your behavior, but you make it ineffective when you ignore it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lafayette also described the need to appeal to the popular majority in order to secure civil rights gains.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was Napoleon who said that no revolution has ever been won without the active support of the majority. Who do you think passed the Civil Rights Bill in Congress?” he asked the crowd. “There weren’t no Black elected officials to pass no bill. We were able to win them over.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the floor opened to questions, the audience honed in specifically on Lafayette’s relationship with the late King.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about his disagreements with King, Lafayette could only recall one — whether or not the Albany Movement to desegregate public spaces in Georgia was a success. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“King believed that we failed, but my position was that no, we succeeded in the Albany Movement. Martin Luther King would always get involved in movements that had larger impact and bring about some national change or national legislation,” Lafayette said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We might have resolved that if he lived.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked how he responded to the news of King’s death, Lafayette described how the tragedy reinstilled in him the drive to continue King’s work. Lafayette said he devoted his energy and attention to King’s broader long-term goal: to spread the practice of nonviolence across the globe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had to make a decision, with the news of his death … I decided to focus on the last words that King said to me: ‘We have got to internationalize and institutionalize nonviolence.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After King’s death, Lafayette returned to school to further educate himself on the law and the utility of nonviolence in social and political advocacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I went to law school at Boston University because I wanted to think like a lawyer. I didn’t want to be a lawyer, but I wanted to think like a lawyer. Then I went to Harvard University to study nonviolence and education, and I got my master’s.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After college, he would continue to work as an activist for decades, becoming a distinguished authority on nonviolent strategies for social activism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with nonviolence, Lafayette said persistence is also a key ingredient in the making of a successful social movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You know, I was beaten in Selma, Alabama, the same night that Medgar Evers who was in the NAACP, in Mississippi, was shot and killed. And they planned to do the same thing to me the same night,” Lafayette said. “Fortunately, I survived that.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The FBI reported to me that [the Ku Klux Klan] had a plan to castrate me, to throw me in the river, and all that, you know. But fortunately I survived it,” he added. “ Don’t give up on the campaign, no matter what happens.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

for implementation. </span><em>Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, Ciara Thrower, a third-year environmental studies major, is authoring a proposal to present to the UCSB Academic Senate that would dissolve the requirement and merge it into the World Cultures requirement, after she gained the unanimous support of the Associated Students (A.S.) Senate last week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thrower said that the European Traditions requirement has a “bad connotation” and has bothered her since her freshman year, as she believes many classes outside the requirement are often Eurocentric.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been looking into [the European Traditions requirement] more and a lot of schools across the country are getting rid of their requirement,” Thrower said in an interview with the Nexus. “And then we’re the only UC that has a requirement like that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with having the general A-E requirements, UCSB also has two requirements in the context of European history under Special Subject Area requirements: the European Traditions requirement and the World Cultures requirement, which includes classes with a focus on “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one or more culture outside of the European tradition.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The European Traditions requirement, defined as any class pertaining to “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">early and/or modern European cultures and their significance in world affairs” has been in place since the 80s, according to Harold Marcuse, a German history professor in the history department at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Marcuse, the requirement was born out of the World Wars and got a boost by the subsequent Cold War, which was enough to solidify the requirement’s place at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just very Eurocentric,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marcuse, who is assisting Thrower in forming the Academic Senate proposal, had pushed to remove the requirement in 2002. According to Marcuse, the current Area E requirement, known as Culture and Thought, was initially split into two sections —  E1 and E2 — one of which was the Western Civilizations requirement, which he called “outdated.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the recommendations that we had was to completely get rid of that requirement, but there was a fair amount of resistance from a few departments,” Marcuse said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now courses tend to really fill up no matter what. But back then some departments really lived from student enrollments in the courses they offered that fulfilled that area requirement.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to maintain enrollment in those classes, Marcuse said that the Western Civilizations requirement was converted into an add-on requirement, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">now known as the European Traditions requirement, while redefining and updating the various other general education categories and requirements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were also suggestions for an LGBTQ+ and interdisciplinary studies requirements, but both of them failed out of departments’ desire to keep the general education requirements as is, Marcuse added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to change the requirement, Marcuse said there are various paths a proposal would have to take before being considered for implementation. After going through multiple committees — such as the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Committee on Courses and General Education, the Academic Senate and the faculty executive committee — the proposal would have to be vetted by the registrar to determine if it can be implemented, according to Marcuse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After receiving feedback from faculty and administration, the proposal would go into a vote in the faculty legislature, a body that encompasses tenured faculty and representatives from the Academic Senate and has the final say on it, according to Marcuse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Thrower, however, the first step was garnering support from student organizations on campus, including a resolution through the A.S. Senate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution, titled “A Resolution To Abandon the European Traditions Requirement,” was authored by Off-Campus Senators Kimia Hadidi and Adalis Rojas and passed at the Feb. 19 Senate meeting. However, the resolution supports abandoning the requirement, which is separate from Thrower’s proposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Hadidi, a bulk of high school history already revolves around Europe — a redundancy with the European Traditions requirement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we do want to learn about other cultures, we should have that option to do it,” she said, “as opposed to just having a European Traditions where it’s one class, [and] in a World Cultures where it’s another, why not combine the two?” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After gaining the Senate’s approval, Thrower said her next step is to present her proposal to the UCSB Academic Senate on March 12 and focus on other universities across the country who have abandoned their versions of the requirements in favor of a more holistic education.</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Organizers are planning to take a vote next Monday to potentially go on strike at UCSB, if UCSC graduate students are dismissed from teaching positions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an informal poll about the possibility of striking at UCSB with 595 responses, 63% of graduate students who responded said they were “willing to pursue” a full strike if UCSC dismisses graduate student strikers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorin noted during the meeting that these numbers are greater than ones from initial strike polls at UCSC prior to the beginning of their strike, and that more than a quarter of the entire graduate student population had responded to the poll. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COLA organizers said in the meeting that they plan to send out another poll next week to graduate students to assess support of a grading strike or full teaching strike and will meet again on Monday evening for COLA General Assembly.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

us to see what is happening on a larger scale, on the social scale, if we are going to address it,” Hill said. Max Abrams/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her discussion, titled “From Social Movement to Social Impact: Putting an End to Sexual Harassment,” challenged the audience to expand their personal definitions of gender-based violence and emphasized the structural change required to transform the culture around sexual harassment and violence across the U.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara’s Feminist Futures Initiative, which brings together UC Santa Barbara faculty, students and outside speakers to collaborate on interdisciplinary research on gender justice, hosted the event alongside the UCSB Women’s Center and local businesswoman Sara Miller McCune. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier in the afternoon, Hill met with over 30 high school students, undergraduates and graduate students, some of whom are engaged with researching sexual harassment on campus, according to Professor Leila Rupp, associate dean of social sciences, who introduced Hill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“None of the students this afternoon were even born when Dr. Hill gave her courageous and world-altering testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee,” Rupp said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill also spoke at UCSB in 1995, and at the beginning of her speech noted that, after 25 years, it is “hard to imagine we are still in the struggle together.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I realize that it’s been a while since 1991. Some of you are probably wondering, ‘Why didn’t you wear that green suit?’ and some of you are probably wondering, ‘Oh, when’s she gonna start dishing the dirt on the senators?’” she joked to the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Hill did not dwell on her own experiences in the Senate Judiciary Committee and instead focused her speech on the work that still remains after the launch of the #MeToo movement, which reignited the conversation about accountability of those in powerful positions regarding sexual harassment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill noted that her own experiences in the Senate parallel that of Christine Blasey Ford, who in 2017 testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that then-Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when she was in high school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have to understand that what happened to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford should never happen again, but we also have to recognize that it is happening every day to somebody in this country,” Hill told the audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill said that outrage over the Kavanaugh confirmation changed the course of the 2018 midterm election, but that the response from the federal government since then has been lacking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No robust government response to gender-based violence has occurred and in this primary cycle, little or no attention has been given to what many call a moment of reckoning that happened back in 2017,” Hill said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lack of conversation around sexual violence, Hill said, includes current 2020 Democratic primary candidates, who participated in a debate in Nevada on the night of Hill’s speech. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are in another debate tonight and if the history proves to be a reflection of what’s going to happen in the future, those questions are not going to be had,” Hill said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill challenged the audience to expand the way they view gender justice to include not only sexual harassment, but sexual assault, domestic violence, rape and incest. To fully understand the problem of gender-based violence, Hill said that society needs to examine the “bigger picture” of how survivors are treated beyond the specifics of their own experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can relate to the individual stories, but it is just as important for us to see what is happening on a larger scale, on the social scale, if we are going to address it,” Hill said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our solutions have to be multi-dimensional because the impacts of gender-based violence are multi-dimensional. It impacts [people’s] ability in many cases, depending on the nature of the problem, to have housing, to be educated, to live safely in their communities.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill said that the U.S. government has “taken on huge social problems,” such as the opioid crisis, by addressing the problem as a matter of public safety, and that the same approach needs to be taken to address gender-based violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Hill said that this can’t be left to the government to solve alone, that individuals need to also view gender-based violence as a matter of public safety and “problem solve as a community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Do we really believe that abuse that affects one person affects us all? Do we really believe that we are all in this? I’m not sure we do.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One structural change Hill proposed to address gender-based violence is to challenge how society as a whole approaches masculinity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This idea of manliness is curated to make us believe that to be a man you must be emotionally restrained, strong and brave, aggressive and awesome,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[That] is not masculinity, it is abuse.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill also elaborated on what she said is the systematic practice of silencing people who choose to come forward with stories of gender-based violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Believing women to be truthful is consistent with fairness and justice,” she said. “Now all of you believe that, right?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After cheers and applause from the audience, she continued, “We are now in a time where if we say we believe survivors, we are met with the claim that we are denying due process. In other words, due process has been weaponized to silence survivors.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do not support a system that presumes every time a woman testifies about abuse, she is lying. But that is what many of us start with: that she cannot be trusted to tell the truth,” Hill emphasized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill’s testimony against Thomas in 1991 raised complicated questions about the intersectionality of race and gender, she said. Opponents criticized Hill for coming forward, saying she “did a disservice to the Black community by testifying.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To those critics, Hill asked for the trust that she believes all survivors deserve. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the Q&amp;A portion of the event, Hill spoke with UCSB feminist studies graduate students Amoni Thompson and Megan Spencer, answering their questions about her career and life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Responding to a question from Spencer about solidarity with student movements, Hill expressed her support for UC graduate students calling for a cost-of-living adjustment, a movement known as COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Affordable housing is an issue for everyone,” Hill said to audience applause. “Unfortunately, most families have to fight that issue on their own, but our students should not have to fight this battle on their own. Universities should be using their resources to help them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill left the audience with a challenge: No matter how difficult it may be to fully change the culture around gender-based violence, she said, it is just as important now as it was when she first spoke to the Senate in 1991 to fight for structural change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is natural to revert back to the status quo. It’s inevitable. But the problem is so severe, we cannot afford to do that.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 20, 2020 print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
