The children would scavenge and beg for food in the streets after the economic turmoil that resulted from the death of President Kim Il-Sung in 1994.</p>\n<p>According to Kim, the lower class in North Korea is constantly under surveillance. Citizens who associate with any religion, make contact outside of the country or show dissent toward the government are criminalized and discriminated against.</p>\n<p>The second defector was a part of the “core” or elite class due to her father’s position as a battalion commander, but her whole family was placed in the hostile class after her mother’s escape to China.</p>\n<p>After her second escape attempt, she was captured but released after promising the government that she would spy on her neighbors and friends. She was imprisoned and released again after her third attempt, but was frustrated with the political structure and finally escaped to South Korea.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76763\" style=\"width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76763\" data-attachment-id=\"76763\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-09/north-korean-defectors-share-stories-at-ucsb/img_9093/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?fit=960%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_9093\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76763\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76763\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Elizabeth Hong</em></p></div>\n<p>Yang Mo, Young North Korea’s College Student Alliance external affairs representative, said he works with other organizations throughout South Korea to facilitate the integration of defectors into education and the workforce.</p>\n<p>Both defectors are now students at universities in South Korea.

What the hell are we doing?” he asked.</p>\n<p>Joe Biden was the vice president under the Obama Administration from 2009 to 2017 and has played a vocal role opposing the Trump Administration since his departure from office.</p>\n<p>Biden encouraged students to remain hopeful about politics, even if they believe the current national climate is broken “beyond repair.”</p>\n<p>“The reason I’m so excited about the millennials is because you reached the same place my generation did in the mid-sixties,” he said. “There’s no damn reason your generation can’t [face what’s ahead].”</p>\n<p>The United States’ involvement in the Vietnam War and the turmoil of the Civil Rights Movement throughout the 1960’s provoked protests and riots throughout the nation and on college campuses, including student anti-war protests at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Biden spoke passionately about the recent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia and reminded the crowd that Americans must bring moral values back into the political system and reject the “phony nationalism” of white supremacists.</p>\n<p>He also criticized President Donald Trump’s response to the protests in Charlottesville.</p>\n<p>“The silence was deafening. Silence is complicity,” he said. “[Silence] emboldens the small number of sick people that are out there.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79251\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79251\" data-attachment-id=\"79251\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-24/biden-expresses-hope-for-the-future-through-students/al_joebiden-171021-dustinharris-02/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-79251\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-79251\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Biden began his night in front of a sold-out crowd at the Arlington Theatre in Santa Barbara. <em>Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB sociology professor Kum-Kum Bhavnani joined Biden onstage for the Q&amp;A portion at the end of the lecture.

The two-year success of CU is similar to that of the Open People’s Party, a former A.S. political party that took the majority of positions for two consecutive years in 2013 to 2014.</p>\n<p>According to CU party co-chairs Madison Hechler and Izabella Kipnis, the party campaigned for the election through reaching out to groups in the Office of Student Life (OSL), tabling on campus and going door-to-door in Isla Vista explaining the CU platform.</p>\n<p>CU candidates were taught how to campaign in I.V., which included training on how the candidates should conduct themselves in any situation that could occur when visiting I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“For the party as a whole, knocking on doors was the most effective way to reach out to people,” Kipnis said.</p>\n<p>Hechler and Kipnis both said the CU party has a family dynamic that allowed the party to bond and work collectively on the campaign.</p>\n<p>“I would start by saying that our name isn’t just a name; we really are a united party,” Kipnis said. “We made an effort so that all our candidates got to know each other and all the campaign managers bonded and were close.”</p>\n<p>“I think that we are a super, super diverse party, and we like to bring in people from different aspects of campus and walks of life,” Hechler added.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77440\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77440\" data-attachment-id=\"77440\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/dsc_4980/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_4980.jpg?fit=2048%2C1214&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1214\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DSC_4980\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_4980.jpg?fit=250%2C148&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_4980.jpg?fit=888%2C526&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-77440\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_4980-1024x607.jpg?resize=888%2C526\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"526\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_4980.jpg?resize=1024%2C607&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_4980.jpg?resize=250%2C148&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_4980.jpg?resize=768%2C455&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_4980.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_4980.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77440\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kristin Hsu (center) thanked her mentor Matthew Santos (left) for her election as external vice president of statewide affairs on Thursday. <em>Alex Yam/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Hechler joined CU last year and worked as a campaign manager for the election.
