Steven Kwok, the forum moderator, posed two questions for candidate response, allotting one minute each. The candidates were allocated 30 seconds for final remarks.</p>\n<p>Kwok first asked the candidates how they would ensure that the LGBTQ community on campus feels safe and recognized. The second question addressed the role the university should play regarding Deltopia.</p>\n<p>Responses to the issues presented by these questions and overarching goals were identified by each candidate as summarized below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ochoa, a third-year communication major, said she hoped for a greater presence for the LGBTQ community on campus. Regarding Deltopia, Ochoa said the successful community outreach done by UC Isla Vista (UCIV) this year was indicative of what the I.V. community should represent.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Cook, a first-year political science major, said he understands the importance in providing a space for the LGBTQ community to share their voice. As vice president of Santa Catalina Hall Council, he said he has helped to created events for LGBTQ students in the hall. Cook said the UCIV program played a crucial role in Deltopia this year, and the university’s provision of the Warm Up concert was a great incentive as well, proving that “the University has truly come full circle on how they view Deltopia and it will only get better from here.”</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Mora, a third-year political science and sociology double major, said he would like to see the expansion of non-gendered bathrooms on campus so the LGBTQ community can be more included on campus. Mora said the university should ensure that the police presence in Isla Vista stays true to the approachable demeanor they held this year, rather than the more hostile demeanor Mora said the police assumed in prior years.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Gessesse, a first-year history of public policy and sociology double major, said she wants to expand the definition of safe spaces for the LGBTQ community on campus to include restrooms and bathrooms. Gessesse said she wants the university to work closely alongside the I.V. Community Services District (CSD) during Deltopia. According to Gessesse, “the university spent a lot of money on advertisements that could be geared towards partnership towards creating safety with I.V. CSD.”</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Btaddini, a second-year political science major, said he wants to “empower the students here that are making an effort to fight for the LGBTQ community and represent students on campus.” Regarding the university’s role during Deltopia, Btaddini said the university should foster the kind of culture that does not punish students on big events, but looks out for their safety.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Dycaico, a second-year history of public policy major, said if elected, she plans to reach out to LGBTQ communities to ensure they are heard and represented. She said the role the university plays in holding alternative events during Deltopia is an effective safety measure, especially when coupled with the help of UCIV.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>DiCesare, a third-year computer science major, said he plans to use his platform “to bring different groups and ideologies on this campus together so we can have a better environment for this campus no matter who you are or what you identify as.” DiCesare said he believes students, as members of the university and as a part of the Isla Vista community, should all take steps during Deltopia to ensure that students are safe in all instances.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Leeman, a second-year mathematical science and German double major, said she wants to reach out to professors to ensure they are incorporating “inclusive language in their syllabi and lectures” for the LGBTQ community. Leeman said the university’s role during Deltopia should be more proactive and less reactive and focus on educating students about why it is in their best interest to protect Isla Vista.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Chandrashekar, a first-year communication major, said that if elected, she plans on making it a point to start a conversation with the LGBTQ community, go to their meetings and hear what their concerns are. She also said students should have a voice in regard to the university funding of precautionary advertisements against Deltopia and where that funding may be better spent.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Kaayal, a second-year biology major, said he hopes to promote as many safe spaces on campus for the LGBTQ community as possible. Concerning the university’s role during Deltopia, Kaayal said he hopes to promote the idea of community policing. He said he believes the university should increase the jurisdiction of CSOs instead of bringing police in from other areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Armellini, a second-year history of public policy major, said she wants to “amplify” the voices in the LGBTQ community and “make sure they’re heard and taken care of.” She said the University’s approach to Deltopia should involve providing students with education, events and communication.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Mansur, a third-year statistics major, said he wants to help students get jobs after graduation, and plans to make Career Services more accessible. He also wants to increase alumni connections with current students. If elected, he said he wants to help students know where their student fees are going.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Sir, a first-year political science major, said she wants to represent minority communities and increase visibility of student resources. If elected, Sir said she wants to expand the A.S. Food Bank to Isla Vista so students can have access to it when off campus.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Pimentel, a second-year political major, said he wants to help keep student fees affordable and facilitate student-run businesses. If elected, he said he wants to serve as the liaison between the student body and the university administration and use A.S. to empower students.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Quash, a first-year statistical science and black studies double major, said he wants to increase off-campus students’ representation. If elected, Quash said he plans to achieve his goals as a senator through maintaining an open dialogue between A.S. and the administration to address issues such as college affordability.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Jayasinghe, a second-year philosophy and global studies double major, said he wants to fix the biggest problems in Isla Vista including parking and work alongside the CSD. If elected, Jayasinghe said he hopes to use his experience of working in the External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) office to improve the community and open the dialogue to include all opinions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Campaigning for A.S. Elections began Sunday and will continue for the next two weeks until voting results are announced on the night of April 27.</p>\n<p>Profiles of all 51 A.S. candidates can be found <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2017/\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77079\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/recap-off-campus-senator-candidate-forum/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77079\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/recap-off-campus-senator-candidate-forum/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/recap-off-campus-senator-candidate-forum/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/recap-off-campus-senator-candidate-forum/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/recap-off-campus-senator-candidate-forum/","id":2723,"author":{"id":100,"name":"Anjalie Tandon"},"related":[2722,2721,2720],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":100,"name":"Anjalie Tandon","biography":"Not available","articles":[2723,3589,4488,6307],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Recap: On-Campus and University-Owned Housing Senator Candidate Forum","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-04-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Monday-A.S.-Elections-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Monday-A.S.-Elections-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Soon after A.S. elections week took off, nine candidates for on-campus and university-owned housing senators discussed resident assistant welfare during a public forum in the Hub on Monday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon after A.S. elections week took off, nine candidates for on-campus and university-owned housing senators discussed resident assistant welfare during a public forum in the Hub on Monday.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77044\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77044\" data-attachment-id=\"77044\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/recap-on-campus-and-university-owned-housing-senator-candidate-forum/monday-a-s-elections-by-jenny-luo-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Monday-A.S.-Elections-by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Monday A.S.

The report outlines the monthly removal of manure from community horse arenas, efforts to minimize runoff to the wetlands and that horse stalls be cleaned weekly and communal areas (such as turnouts) be cleaned four times a week.</p>\n<p>Jenny Dugan, UCSB associate research biologist and HBA faculty advisor, works very closely with the CCC and submitted the Manure Management Plan to the CCC on March 25, 2015.</p>\n<p>Holly Nuovo, senior environmental studies major and treasurer of HBA, considers the plan pivotal to UCSB’s sustainability plan. “I know they include our manure tonnage in their sustainability reports, so whenever they’re talking about waste management, part of that is about us,” she said.</p>\n<p>The all natural and organic manure is donated to the Indigenous Gardening Club and other gardening communities in the area, making the reuse of the manure beneficial to UCSB’s sustainability plan.</p>\n<p>The CCC is a state organization that regulates the university’s developments. They aim to protect environmentally sensitive habitats, requiring the university to restore one area in tandem with any new development in the coastal area, like the Sierra Madre housing. The CCC could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>The HBA has been active since the 1970s and has been fighting forced closures by the university since the 1990s. They have halted definitive closures by pressuring the chancellor’s office with an influx of letters intended to emphasize their value to the community.</p>\n<p>“They think that what we offer doesn’t have enough value, and so they can promise the Coastal Commission that they’ll remove our activity and restore the natural habitat in order to get approval for their other development projects,” said Nuovo.</p>\n<p>LRDP regulations prevent the HBA from changing the aerial view of the barn by creating any new permanent structures, repairs or effectively altering the “footprint” of the barn.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75779\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75779\" data-attachment-id=\"75779\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/horse-1-by-min-xie/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Horse 1 by Min Xie\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-75779\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-75779\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The stables, located near West Campus and Devereaux Slough, sit atop environmentally sensitive areas.<br>Because of this, the campus has been tasked with closing the facilities down within the next 10 years. <em>Min Xie / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The LRDP restrictions maintain that repairs cannot result in the demolition or reconstruction of 50 percent or more of any structure. The facility also abides by the CCC’s environmental sustainability regulations.</p>\n<p>Lauren Rudnick, a second-year mechanical engineering major and member of the HBA, is currently making repairs to her horse’s stable and is mainly concerned with the longevity and safety of the stall.</p>\n<p>“These restrictions make it difficult to fully repair anything,” Rudnick said, adding that from a legal standpoint, the restrictions could be at fault if the animals or caretakers are harmed.</p>\n<p>Sitting about 300 to 400 yards away from the edge of the horse facility is a wetland buffer zone that the Coastal Commission closely maintains.</p>\n<p>The HBA has planted blackberries, Bermuda grass and other native bushes around the stalls and the buffer zone. The plants absorb nitrogen and other plant-growing material to filter the runoff from the horse’s manure so no harm comes to the wetlands.</p>\n<p>“It is possible to co-exist with the slough. We are doing it now,” Nuovo said.</p>\n<p>Existing restrictions to build in the area because of native burial sites and environmental concerns make the area convenient to use as “leverage,” Nuovo said. Pressure from UC Regents to make campuses larger put the university in a position to follow through with the closure.</p>\n<p>It would take roughly 20 years or more for the area to be restored as a wetland. The slough does not naturally reach the facility, so major excavations would occur for water to reach the area.</p>\n<p>“They use this land as a tool to return to the environment, but I honestly feel that what we do here helps the students integrate into the environment and the community at whole so much better than just returning it straight to wetland,” Nouvo said, adding that the facility offers affordable horse boarding opportunities to students that could not otherwise afford it.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, February 16, 2017 print edition of

The first question pertained to the use of hate speech on campus, while the second one asked the candidates how they plan to work with the administration to achieve their goals as senators.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates were given 30 seconds for opening and closing remarks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates explained to audience members their plans for improving the lives of UCSB students. Here are some of the highlights:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Al-Anbar, a third-year anthropology major, said she wants to “pioneer” a transfer commission and help marginalized students feel more represented on campus. She said she believes that while there is a constitutional right to free speech, the university should “not entertain” hate speech and help maintain an environment free from violence.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maalizadeh, a third-year biology major, said he wants to improve CLAS access for transfer students and expand transfer orientation, two issues he wants to work on with the university administrators. He said it is an “amazing time” to be a transfer student, and he wants to focus his efforts on increasing support for them. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carey, a second-year global studies and geography double major, said he wants to use his “passion for academics” and “ability to strive as a leader” to serve his community. According to Carey, hate speech should not be tolerated on campus, and he hopes he can “use existing channels” of communication with campus administrators to achieve his goals as a senator.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez, a third-year political science major, said she wants students to know how A.S. can affect change on campus. She also said she wants to “streamline” the dialogue between A.S. and university administrators and work to decrease tuition and increase class enrollment availability. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel, a second-year political science major, said she wants to ensure that student fees are seen through student resources. Kopel said she believes hate speech can make some students “feel alienated” on campus and wants to help facilitate productive dialogue between differing groups. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banicki, a first-year biology major, said he wants to create more outdoor study spaces and hammocks on campus. He also said he wants to emphasize mental health and extend resources to students who may feel overwhelmed. As the president of the Santa Catalina South Residence Hall, he said he already “has a foot in the door” to work with university administrators. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez, a second-year sociology and economics double major, said she wants to increase representation of minority groups on campus. If elected, she said, she hopes to make college life more affordable and accessible to students.      </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uemura, a first-year chemistry major, said she wants to implement a mental health counselor for CCS and ensure an open dialogue with campus administrators. She said she believes there is a “fine line” between hate speech and free speech and said she hopes to maintain CCS as a “very safe space” that is welcome to everyone.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almas, a second-year chemical engineering major, said he wants to work on making college more affordable for students, citing the high costs of tutoring and textbooks.
