If it does apply, the lease would have to be cancelled in its entirety, meaning all residents would have to vacate, not just the ones who wish to move out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Parents and students] aren’t understanding exactly what they’re reading. Some of it depends on state to state because every state has different laws. This isn’t a federal law. In California, if there’s nothing in your contract that supports, ‘Hey, if there is an act of God situation, then you can excuse yourself from your contract,’ then it doesn’t apply,” Unander said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second term Unander said she has seen used is called a breach of habitability, which can be used if the location is unfit for human occupation or affects the safety of the tenants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Unander said this term also does not apply because the decision to cancel classes, as well as the spread of the virus, “doesn’t make the house uninhabitable,” even if an Isla Vistan is diagnosed with the virus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The water works, the electricity works, the heating works, the lighting works — assuming there are no problems with the apartment to begin with. But otherwise, the fact that they might be self-quarantining or being quarantined does not make the unit uninhabitable,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it may be impossible for residents to break their leases, Unander noted that, depending on the specific lease, tenants can find someone to temporarily or permanently take their places, although Unander emphasized that there is a difference between the two. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If someone is temporarily taking the original tenant’s place — for example, if the original tenant goes abroad or spends the summer away from Santa Barbara — the temporary tenant is considered a subleaser. The subleaser reports to the original tenant and the original tenant reports to the landlord, Unander said; the original tenant is responsible for the actions of the subleaser.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a more permanent situation, where a new tenant takes over the lease completely, the original tenant is “assigning” all of their rights and interests to the person taking their place, meaning the security deposit changes hands and the original tenant will no longer have any relationship with the landlord, Unander explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. residents must check their leases to see what their landlords’ policies are on allowing replacements, Unander said, adding that landlords have the “absolute right” to say that tenants cannot sublease, or that tenants cannot have someone take their places unless they have the landlord’s written consent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If tenants leave and refuse to pay their rent, or if they sublease without the landlord’s prior consent, landlords are well within their rights to pursue legal action against the tenant, Unander warned. </span></p>\n<p>She emphasized in the memo that the decision “to not let you out of your lease is not personal or intended to take advantage of the situation.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Please keep in mind that most landlords have mortgages and bills to pay arising from your apartment, regardless of whether you are currently occupying it. Most or all cannot afford to cancel your lease and absorb loss of rents,” Unander wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it may be nearly impossible for I.V. residents to break their leases, UCSB-specific Facebook groups have been flooded with posts from students looking to sublease their rooms for the quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joana Gutierrez, a third-year history of public policy and feminist studies double major, said she couldn’t justify the cost of rent in I.V. when she had the option to move home. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If I’m not gonna be here, why am I gonna pay overpriced rent, you know?” she said, adding that she felt like she needed a break from I.V. culture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everybody’s super excited about not having classes face-to-face, but that leads to a lot of binge drinking, and it’s stuff that I’m really trying to stay away from for my mental health,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While she hasn’t had luck in finding a subleaser yet, Gutierrez said she has mostly been asking her friends who live in university housing, versus looking for someone on social media. Gutierrez added that her roommate also hadn’t found a subleaser but has already gone home and would continue to pay rent through his financial aid refund check.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people are probably gonna be doing that, and that’s probably what I’m gonna end up doing if I don’t find a subleaser, but financially, it would be better to find someone,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other I.V. residents are planning on staying in Santa Barbara for the duration of the quarter, citing harmful home environments, jobs or other responsibilities in the area. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice Dumlao, a fifth-year global studies major and Associated Students (A.S.) senator, said he was staying in I.V. to continue working and to avoid a “toxic” home environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While my job is kind of up in the air, whether it will be completely open or how we can get hours, I just don’t have a job back home and that means I won’t be able to make money to pay my rent,” Dumlao said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Additionally, home is just not super healthy,” he said. “The idea of being there for an extended period of time that’s not just a break sounds pretty bad for my mental health.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tyler Ferguson, a second-year pre-political science major and another A.S. senator, said that in addition to staying because he was “locked into [his] lease,” he wanted to be able to continue carrying out his senatorial duties and supporting other students staying in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ferguson noted that for him, staying in I.V. instead of finding a subleaser — which would require him to pay $500 to his landlord — was the best economic decision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m also wanting to get a job out here,” he said. “Being low-income, I definitely need work, and back home there’s not really many jobs available.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Not Pictured: ON-Campus Senator Ashley Davis. <em>Katherine Swartz / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These vacancies were created during the Spring Quarter 2019 Associated Student (A.S.) elections, after only three candidates ran for five on-campus seats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The appointment of a College of Creative Studies senator marks the first time this seat has been filled in two years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the beginning of the 70th Senate term in Spring Quarter of 2019, Internal Vice President Alli Adam created an ad-hoc committee to find and nominate students to fill the three vacancies. Instead of a general election, the three new senators were chosen through an application and interview process by the ad-hoc committee before being officially appointed this Wednesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a huge accomplishment. Senates in the past have tried to fill seats to no avail, and the fact that you were able to fill the seats in week four </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marisela and I are very proud,” Adam said to senators during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Tianna White led the ad-hoc committee and announced in her report on Wednesday that the three senators have “fully met the standard” of legal code with eligibility. White took a “holistic approach” in the interview process for candidates, reviewing past leadership, involvement, project goals and what they plan to bring to Senate. </span></p>\n<p><b>On-Campus Senator Anvitha Aluri </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anvitha Aluri, a second-year biology major, was appointed for one of two vacant on-campus senator positions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanted to just apply because I feel like there’s so many things on campus that I see my friends are talking about, what they wish could be better. And I feel like if I could kind of help bring some of their concerns forward too, that’s why [I applied].“</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her free time, Aluri volunteered at a local middle school students and at the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center. It was her volunteer experience there that showed Aluri the importance of resources for sexual assault survivors, something she plans to carry into her term by advocating for more resources for </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.R.E.) and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.P.S.). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like if there was a better way of … being easier for someone just to come in or even anonymously talk to someone. I think it would make people feel a lot more safe.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Aluri’s main concerns she finds with the university is the high price of on-campus housing. Aluri expressed that campus housing is more expensive than living off-campus, but for some students with scholarships, that is their only option. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One particular element of Aluri’s on-campus housing initiative is changing the meal plan requirement for students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They shouldn’t make you get a meal plan. I guess I kind of understand how they need to make people have meal plans, but they can also change the system to Gaucho bucks or something like that where I feel like it would just be as easy to use it rather than [being] forced to get a meal plan.”</span></p>\n<p><b>On-Campus Senator Ashley Davis </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashley Davis was first approached about running for senate by current off-campus senator Eric Moon during last year’s spring elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Davis, a second-year sociology major, felt her other commitments during her freshman year kept her from “doing a full election and campaigning.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis previously served as a desk attendant for San Nicolas residence hall, was a Real Talk facilitator for her residence hall last year, currently serves as a house manager for the Department of Theater and Dance, serves as the administrative vice president of the Residential Housing Association and is the external coordinator for the Queer Commission. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I always had in the back of my mind as something that I’d be doing like my junior or senior year and not something that would happen this quickly,” Davis said. “But I really like the idea of being influential on campus, representing students that weren’t typically represented on this kind of scale.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis said she is still “getting [her] bearings and doing research” about what issues senators are already addressing, but she is “excited to get more information firsthand.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some issues she expressed an interest in are environmental justice and LGBTQ visibility and rights by working with the Trans Task Force and Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Personally, I hope that I can be an active member of the communities that I already participate in and an ally for those that I don’t.”</span></p>\n<p><b>College of Creative Studies Senator Daniel Mitchell</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniel Mitchell first considered running for an off-campus senate seat for the 2020-2021 term, until he heard from current on-campus senator Emma Swanson that a seat was currently open to represent the College of Creative Studies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Representing CCS seems like a lot cooler opportunity personally for me, especially to incorporate the artsy part of CCS into my A.S. work.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell, a second-year CCS music composition major, hopes to blend his passions for the arts and public policy to help CCS and Letters and Science artists collaborate on new projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell says he has a “passion” for public service and told senators that he grew up volunteering for political campaigns with his family. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s this same element of teamwork that drew him towards being an A.S. Senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think this is a good place to start because [UCSB] is a small community, but if I’m serious about running for other elected offices, I think this is a good way to start to get a sense of what legislating is like.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell hopes to run for Isla Vista Community Services District after he graduates and eventually State Assembly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was involved with Campus Democrats and Chamber Choir last year and currently serves with Lobby Corps. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell’s two main goals for the year are expanding arts programming and environmental justice work. Some ideas he mentioned for arts events are creating a Isla Vista student band concert at Storke Plaza and bringing local artists to campus to hold workshops for students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through spearheading initiatives for environmental justice, Mitchell wants to continue UCSB’s reputation of spearheading green initiatives. Mitchell hopes to work with the Coastal Fund to start beach cleanups after Deltopia, as well as planting more local trees around campus. </span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [10/25 11:06 a.m.]: A previous version said it had been three years since the CCS Senator seat had been filled.
