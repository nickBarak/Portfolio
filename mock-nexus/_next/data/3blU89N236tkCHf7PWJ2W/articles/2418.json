As news began spreading throughout the affected countries, Rasekh learned firsthand that she was one of three UCSB students barred from reentering the U.S.</p>\n<p>For one month following the executive order, Rasekh remained at her home in Iran, unable to return to her studies at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The worst thing about it was the rollercoaster,” she told the <em>Nexus</em> in an interview Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Her first instinct was to wait. She said she had heard “horror stories” of immigrants waiting in limbo at U.S. airports as Customs and Border Protection agents denied visas that many of them had waited months — or even years — to attain.</p>\n<p>All she did was write an email to the embassy asking what had happened.</p>\n<p>Over a week later, a federal appeals court lifted the travel ban. The U.S. embassy responded to her email saying she would receive a visa once again.</p>\n<p>When she obtained her first visa to the United States in 2013, Rasekh had traveled on plane to Ankara, Turkey, the nearest U.S. embassy to Iran. Because Rasekh did not want to make the trip again in early February, she paid a visit to an Iranian travel agency to request they go on her behalf.</p>\n<p>When she returned home from the agency, Rasekh looked on her computer and found another response from the U.S. embassy. The officials told her to “hold off, disregard the previous email and just wait.”</p>\n<p>“I was still scared, [thinking] ‘will they mark it as rejected? What will they do?’” she said.</p>\n<p>Almost another week passed by until the embassy had updated her visa status again. On Feb. 16, the U.S. embassy once again assured her the valid visa that Trump’s travel ban had denied.</p>\n<p>Rasekh returned to UCSB last Monday, Feb. 27, just days before Trump issued a modified executive order on March 6, lifting some restrictions and cementing others.</p>\n<p>The new travel ban allows entry for current U.S. visa holders and refugees who have already been granted asylum and removes travel restrictions from Iraq. Students with J visas, such as Rasekh, will be allowed entry. The ban will go into effect March 16.</p>\n<p>“I scraped past,” she said, adding that many of her family and friends may remain unable to enter the U.S. in the months to come.</p>\n<p>Rasekh’s return last Monday marks the third time she has made the trip to the U.S. She first came to UCSB in February 2013 to join as a researcher in the electrical engineering department.</p>\n<p>It was during her time as a researcher that she met her boyfriend Hassan Arbabi, a fellow Iranian and researcher in the mechanical engineering department. Arbabi acted as a correspondent to the <em>Nexus</em> on Rasekh’s behalf when she was barred in early February.</p>\n<p>“He was actually more stressed out than me. Even when the ban was lifted, he was like, ‘Don’t come on Monday; come on Sunday because you don’t know, maybe he’ll sign a new one,’” she said. “He was really trying to shield me from all his stress and anxiety.”</p>\n<p>Rasekh said her sister, who studies at Boston University, was also worried for Rasekh during Trump’s travel ban. She even tried to put Rasekh in touch with Joe Kennedy, the U.S. Congressman out of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>“Everybody here was more stressed out than I think myself,” Rasekh said.</p>\n<p>For the two weeks since her return, Rasekh has been continuing her research in the engineering labs. Because of her prolonged stay in Iran, Rasekh missed a conference on Feb. 21, where she was supposed to present her research, and she was unable to enroll for courses in the Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p>“I arrived too late,” she said.</p>\n<p>Rasekh still expects to receive her Ph.D. in April, although she is unsure whether she will stay in the U.S. after that point.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if U.S. still looks like a good prospect for living,” she said. “I think it’s in the back of all Iranians’ minds that maybe we should plan long-term on somewhere else.”</p>\n<p>She said Trump’s latest actions lead her to believe that, for Iranian immigrants, “it’s never going to be safe” to live in the United States.</p>\n<p>“And it’s not just laws. Just the general atmosphere; if it’s going to keep going toward all this tension, then it’s bad for everybody,” she said. “There’s a reason people choose the U.S. to work and live in, and this could be hurting that.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, March 9, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76341\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-grad-student-returns-to-u-s-after-rollercoaster-travel-ban/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76341\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-grad-student-returns-to-u-s-after-rollercoaster-travel-ban/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-grad-student-returns-to-u-s-after-rollercoaster-travel-ban/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-grad-student-returns-to-u-s-after-rollercoaster-travel-ban/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-grad-student-returns-to-u-s-after-rollercoaster-travel-ban/","id":2418,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2417,2416,2415],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz","biography":"Not available","articles":[2355,2371,2376,2377,2406,2411,2412,2418,2420,2422,2427,2435,2450,2451,2459,2498,2505,2509,2556,2577,2605,2624,2691,2696,2713,2716,2717,2742,2771,2848,2858,2874,2907,2941,2951,3440,3458,3600,3602,3629,3742,3743,3747,3864,3904,3953,3956,4139,4421,4428,4447,4459,4480,4484,4490,4500,4507,4508,4509,4575,4587,4589,4598,4603,4618,4621,4627,4628,4632,4641,4646,4648,4651,4653,4661,4663,4675,4705,4745,4765,4773,4778,4815],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"George Thurlow Joins CSD on First Day of Business","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-4.jpg?resize=768%2C512&ssl=1","description":"The CSD held its first public meeting on Tuesday in which the Board elected officers, established three new committees and addressed an open forum of community members.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Decades of self-governance movements culminated in a six-hour gathering at the Isla Vista Community Room this Tuesday evening when the I.V.

And these would all be paid interns,” Thurlow said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76284\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76284\" data-attachment-id=\"76284\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-08/george-thurlow-joins-csd-on-first-day-of-business/csd-first-day-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-2.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"768,512\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CSD First Day-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-2.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76284\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-2.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76284\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jay Freeman, Bob Geis, Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, Natalie Jordan and George Thurlow are sworn in by Supervisor Das Williams (from left to right). <em>Jose Ochoa/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Among the items discussed on the meeting’s agenda were the creation of three committees – the formation, internships and policy committees – which will work on getting the government organization started, hiring additional staff and writing policy.</p>\n<p>Members of the CSD also prepared a 90-day action plan outlining potential solutions to I.V. problems. The plan is an unofficial 25-page document prepared by Bertrand and Brandt detailing plans to establish a municipal advisory council, a graffiti abatement program and to develop a solution to the parking problem in I.V., among several other ideas for the unincorporated area.</p>\n<p>The CSD will meet every first and third Tuesday of every month at 6 p.m. at the I.V.

href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/documents-show-6-ucsb-employees-violated-title-ix-policy/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> in March that 124 UC staff and faculty members were accused of violating Title IX between January 2013 and April 2016. Of the six UCSB staff and faculty accused, all investigations were conducted under old Title IX policy from 2013, according to UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada.</p>\n<p>UC sexual harassment policy underwent its latest change in January 2016, after UC President Janet Napolitano organized the Task Force in 2014 on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Assault. The Task Force was comprised of committees dedicated to revising multiple aspects of the policy.</p>\n<p>Title IX is a federal state law ensuring that all students have the opportunity to participate in federally funded educational programs without discrimination based on sex. The law can apply to cases of sexual misconduct and assault and any university-affiliated organization, including sports groups and admissions.</p>\n<p>Of the six UCSB investigations, one faculty member received a salary reduction, and the university required another to attend sexual harassment training and personal counseling. Two cases ended with the termination of an employee.</p>\n<p>In other cases, the Title IX office substantiated the claims, but the university took no further disciplinary action as far as documents show.</p>\n<p>Estrada said in an email that it is “too speculative” to conclude if these case investigations would have resulted differently under the 2016 policy revisions.</p>\n<p>Kathleen Salvaty, the UC Title IX coordinator, also said she could not know if an outcome of a case would have been different under the revised policy, but she said the new policy changes would improve Title IX for future cases.</p>\n<p>“I can say that the current policy, and the recommended changes the campuses are implementing, have strengthened the University’s processes and procedures,” Salvaty said in an email.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76141\" style=\"width: 908px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76141\" data-attachment-id=\"76141\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/documents-show-6-ucsb-employees-violated-title-ix-policy/title-ix-graphic-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?fit=898%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"898,426\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"title ix graphic 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?fit=250%2C119&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?fit=888%2C421&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76141\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?resize=888%2C421\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?w=898&amp;ssl=1 898w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?resize=250%2C119&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?resize=768%2C364&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76141\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Adjustments made to the policy did, however, alter the way the UC investigates student and employee cases.</p>\n<p>According to Salvaty, under the new policy, Title IX officers review student-on-student sexual violence claims under the same procedures across all UC campuses.</p>\n<p>Employee-related cases also underwent “important provisions,” including the requirements that investigations must be concluded within 60 days, both the complainant and the respondent must be notified of the investigation’s outcome and the complainant must be informed of the repercussions imposed on the respondent.</p>\n<p>“Those are some big changes that come to mind,” Salvaty said in an email.</p>\n<p>While Salvaty could not speak about specific cases, she said cases reviewed under the older policy could not be reconsidered a second time, even though policies have changed.</p>\n<p>“I assume that if a matter was investigated and adjudicated under a then existing process, it could not be investigated again under a new process,” Salvaty said in an email.</p>\n<p>Salvaty said, however, that consequences for violators may differ depending on each university because decisions on penalties are decided upon by the supervisors of each case at the university, not the Title IX officers and investigators.</p>\n<p>This can result in varied forms of punishment for UC staff and faculty members.</p>\n<p>The UCOP Task Force recommended that each UC campus increase sexual harassment and assault training amongst staff and faculty and create a Campus, Advocacy, Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) Advocate on each campus to help survivors of sexual violence and sexual harassment, which UCSB has instated. They also recommend the development of a campus Peer Review Committee to review final investigation reports and advise the chancellor on disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>The UC campuses are currently in the process of implementing all the Task Force’s recommendations.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, March 9, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76340\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76340\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/","id":2415,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2414,2413,2412],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: Local Freebies and Activities This Week","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vistapoint-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This week, catch the 'zine scene with The Catalyst, desserts with the elderly and more.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>STATE OF THE UNION</strong><br>\nThe next Isla Vista Community Network meeting will be held Thursday at the I.V.
