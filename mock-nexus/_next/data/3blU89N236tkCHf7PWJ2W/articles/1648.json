Senior midfielder Luis Silva had a goal and an assist during the loss, adding to his league-leading 16-goals, but the Gauchos weren’t able to close out the game.</p>\n<p>“We got the two-goal lead that we needed to win that game,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We did what we had to do to try and win the game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB and UCI entered the second period of extra time deadlocked at 2-2. Irvine was able to attack the Gaucho defense and convert on a rebounded ball that bounced off the goalpost before being tapped in by forward Miguel Ibarra.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With the win, Irvine will likely be seeded among the top 16 teams before beginning the NCAA tournament, guaranteeing the Anteaters a first-round bye and home field advantage. UCSB is also likely to gain a high seeding in the NCAA tournament brackets, in large part due to a preseason schedule that yielded victories against Duke (Sept. 2) and Akron (Oct. 5).</p>\n<p>The poor field conditions only worsened as the minutes progressed throughout the game, transforming the once-green pitch into a muddy landscape of potholes and divots.</p>\n<p>“The quality of the surface on the field was not great,” Vom Steeg said. “We played Garza and on his first touch [the ball] bounced up and took away a scoring opportunity for us.”</p>\n<p>UCI was able to get off eight shots during the first half, compared to just four for UCSB, and took a 1-0 lead going into the break. UCSB responded in the 64th minute when physical play inside the goal box led to a penalty kick by Silva, who has scored on two of his three attempts this year.</p>\n<p>“Silva is the best player in the conference,” Vom Steeg said. “He played that way in the biggest game of the year. In my opinion, he’s the offensive MVP of the conference.”</p>\n<p>Silva added to his offensive attack less than five minutes later on a free kick from 23 yards outside of the box. A streaking sophomore forward Dom Sarle was able to corral the ball and touch it into the goal, giving UCSB a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Irvine had multiple opportunities in the second half to tie the score that were interrupted by the play of junior goalkeeper André Grandt. A breakaway by the UC Irvine offense forced Grandt into a one-on-one situation, where he was able to make the save.</p>\n<p>With less than 10 minutes remaining in the game, Grandt again made an influential play for the UCSB defense during a UCI free kick.</p>\n<p>“The shot was right on me and I got both hands on the ball,” Grandt said. “Next thing I know, 3-4 [Irvine] players were all sliding into me. I had both my hands on the ball so it was called a foul.”</p>\n<p>An Irvine throw-in with just two minutes remaining in regulation made its way to the front of the UCSB goal box, where it was successfully headed in by the Anteater offense. The 2-2 tie pushed the game into double overtime where UCI was able to score off of a rebounded shot and win the tournament championship.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

later, UCSB’s season culminates this week as a title match is on the line.

Along with the championship, much will be at stake as a spot in the NCAA Tournament will also be up for grabs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the season, UCSB holds a 12-3-4 overall record and are 4-1-2 in conference play. Currently on a two-game unbeaten streak, the Gauchos have slowly started to pick up their form now in the postseason. Considering that Friday’s title match will be away at UC Davis, it’s also worth noting that UCSB continues to be undefeated when on the road. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heading into this one, the Gauchos will be coming off a dominant 2-0 home victory over CSUN in the Big West Tournament Semifinals. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for UC Davis, their season stands at an overall record of 12-4-2 and 5-1-1 in the Big West. After a slow start to their season, the team has truly turned it around and will give the Gauchos their toughest challenge yet as they are also undefeated in playing at home. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Aggies also earned a 2-0 home victory of their own in the semifinals against Cal State Fullerton, and there will be no rested advantage for either the Aggies or the Gauchos as both teams finished the conference regular season as the top-two seeded teams, thus granting them each first-round byes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historically, UCSB is favored in this matchup, as the Gauchos lead in the all-time record versus the Aggies by a record of 23-10-6. However, these two sides have met only once before this season, back in late October, and that encounter resulted in a 1-1 draw after double overtime. In addition, the Gauchos were also missing a few key players that day due to several sustained injuries. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the announcement of the yearly Big West honors, a total of eight Gauchos were named for the all-conference team, including Noah Billingsley for Defensive Player of the Year, Thibault Candia for Co-Midfielder of the Year and Finn Ballard McBride for Freshman of the Year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in terms of whom to watch for among the Gauchos at Friday’s championship game, junior forward Rodney Michael and senior forward Will Baynham are the players in form. As it stands, both members of the dynamic duo lead their team in playmaking with 8 assists apiece. They’ve also managed to get their names on the scoresheet quite frequently as Bayham has the second-most goals for the Gauchos with 7, and Michael comes in fourth with 5 goals to his name. Of the striking duo, each notched a goal for UCSB in their semifinal bout versus CSUN, and each will surely play a pivotal role in the final title match as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the Aggies, they have a star striker of their own in senior forward Adam Mickelson. After scoring the second goal for his side’s semifinal match against Cal State Fullerton, Mickelson now has 4 goals on the season to go along with his team-leading 5 assists. As Mickelson is also leading his team in total shots, it’ll be vital for the Gauchos to keep UC Davis’ main offensive target from getting hot. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With plenty of storylines in the mix and plenty of star players to compete this week, the Big West Tournament Final is shaping up to be yet another great day for soccer fans.

The Friars beat Dartmouth University 1-0 in order to advance to the second round.

The New York native has seen action in all 21 of UCSB’s games this year, and his eight assists on the season ranks No. 2 overall on the team.</p>\n<p>UCSB had a rocky start to Big West conference play with just a 2-4 record to open the season. A five-game winning streak to close out the regular season allowed the Gauchos to compete in the Big West tournament for the fourth consecutive year. A win against UC Davis in the semifinal match of the tournament allowed the Gauchos to face UC Irvine in the championship, where they were defeated on the road 3-2 in double overtime.</p>\n<p>Senior midfielder Luis Silva, who had a goal and an assist in the losing effort against UCI, currently leads the league in goals scored with 16 and goals per game with .80. Silva was named the Big West conference midfielder of the year, adding to a growing list of awards that includes numerous player of the week honors, as well as all-Big West honors for the third straight season. Silva is joined on the All-Big West list by junior forward Sam Garza, senior defender Tim Pontius and senior midfielder James Kiffe, who was also recognized as Big West conference defender of the year.</p>\n<p>“We always had players that could score goals for us,” Sarle said. “It helps getting recognize but we knew that all along so hopefully we can keep it up.”</p>\n<p>Providence College saw success during the early part of its season with a five-game winning streak, and was able to clinch a berth in the Big East tournament by finishing among the top six teams in the conference. The Friars lost in the first round of the conference tournament by a score of 5-0 to a Louisville team that had lost last year’s NCAA championship match against Akron University.</p>\n<p>Providence ranks No. 15 out of 16 in the conference in shots (193) and No. 9 in the conference in goals per game with 1.39, similar in number to the amount of goals per game allowed by UCSB, which stands at 1.38. Sophomore forward Greg Davis and freshman midfielder Marcos Ugarte each lead the Friars in goals with six apiece. Ugarte, along with junior midfielder Marc Cintron, received all-Big East honors this season.</p>\n<p>There are stark contrasts in each team’s offensive capabilities. While UCSB has taken a total of 340 shots on the season, Providence has tallied just 193 attempts. However both teams are fairly even in shooting percentage; Providence holds a .130 success rate and the Gauchos manage to score on .138 of their shots.</p>\n<p>The teams are almost as equally matched in the shots-on-goal category. Providence scores on .461 of its shots on frame, while UCSB is able to score at a .435 rate of shots on goal. Gaucho junior goalkeeper André Grandt has amassed 60 saves thus far this season, rivaled by 56 total saves by Providence goalie Jhojan Obando.</p>\n<p>Should Sunday’s match be stretched to overtime, both teams will compete with experience in extra minutes. Providence is undefeated in overtime matches this season, with a 1-0 win coming against Rhode Island and a 1-1 double OT tie against USF, while UCSB is 4-1-1 in overtime matches this year.</p>\n<p>“When we get chances we have to finish them early, Sarle said. “We know what we have to do when we get tight games [because] we’ve learned from this year, NCAA games are going to [be decided by] one or two goals … There will be close games.”</p>\n<p>The winner of Sunday’s game will move on to the third round to face the winner of Northern Illinois vs. No. 2 Creighton. Kickoff is set for 5 p.m. on Sunday at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43112\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-18/gauchos-face-friars-ncaa-tourney/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43112\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-18/gauchos-face-friars-ncaa-tourney/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-18/gauchos-face-friars-ncaa-tourney/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-18/gauchos-face-friars-ncaa-tourney/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-18/gauchos-face-friars-ncaa-tourney/","id":1646,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1645,1644,1643],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Second Seeded Gauchos Set to Kick Off 2010 Postseason","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The No. 10 UCSB men’s soccer team, currently ranked No. 2 in the league, will find itself in a familiar postseason position tonight when it hosts UC Davis in a Big West tournament semifinal match.

During that game, UCSB out-shot the Aggies 21-12, including a 6-4 advantage in shots on goal.</p>\n<p>“We have a high-powered offense,” junior forward Michael Nonni said. “We generate so many chances, it’s ridiculous. If we can put some away in the first half we can play more defensive [in the second half].”</p>\n<p>Davis countered with a goal during the second half, forcing the game to enter extra minutes. Junior forward Sam Garza was able to connect on the game-winning goal in overtime.</p>\n<p>“In overtime what we’ve done all season long is have certain players on our team that are playmakers do something special to win the game,” Vom Steeg said. “We made sure one of those players had the ball.”</p>\n<p>Eleven of UCD’s 18 games this season have gone into extra time. UCSB holds an undefeated 4-0-1 record in overtime this year, while UC Davis has compiled a 4-3-4 mark during extra minutes, including the loss to UCSB.</p>\n<p>Three weeks after the OT win, UCD traveled to Harder Stadium to play the second league match against UCSB. The game ended with a 3-1 Gaucho victory in which Vom Steeg’s offense again held the advantage in shots taken (12-6) and shots on goal (4-2). Two of UCSB’s three goals were scored by senior defender Tim Pontius, including a 61-yard shot from behind the midfield line.</p>\n<p>“We moved the ball well,” Nonni said. “Most of our goals are gonna come off passing, moving and getting behind the defense.”</p>\n<p>UC Davis ended its final two games of the regular season in double overtime 1-1 ties against Cal State Fullerton and UC Riverside. The Aggies have had a strong showing on the road during conference play, with wins coming against Cal Poly, Cal State Northridge and UC Irvine during the regular season.</p>\n<p>“They are dangerous on set pieces and counter-attacks,” Vom Steeg said. “If we can transition well and make sure we win the battle of the 18-yard box, I think we can keep them from scoring.”</p>\n<p>UCSB is currently 8-2-1 at home this season, and has compiled a 16-4-4 overall record against UC Davis. UCD last beat the Gauchos during a regular season game in 2008.</p>\n<p>The winner of tonight’s game will move on to the Big West championship. A match between league-ranked No. 1 UC Irvine and league-ranked No. 4 UC Riverside will determine the opponent for tonight’s victor.</p>\n<p>A two-day break over the weekend was a much needed period of rest for a team that has been subject to injury throughout the season and has played four games through the past 10 days.</p>\n<p>“We were able to gives guys Saturday and Sunday off,” Vom Steeg said. “We got some of our legs back. We should be a fresh team come Wednesday night.”</p>\n<p>Senior midfielder Luis Silva will start tonight’s game as the league leader in goals scored with 15 total on the season. Silva and junior forward Dom Sarle are each tied for first in the Big West in assists with eight apiece.</p>\n<p>Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium. Unlike regular season games, students will be charged a $5 admission at the entrance gates.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42722\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-09/seeded-gauchos-set-kick-2010-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42722\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-09/seeded-gauchos-set-kick-2010-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-09/seeded-gauchos-set-kick-2010-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-09/seeded-gauchos-set-kick-2010-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-09/seeded-gauchos-set-kick-2010-postseason/","id":1647,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1646,1645,1644],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
