This isn’t because student fees are too low, it’s because California refuses to invest in public education.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement was released a couple of hours before voting officially opened on G.O.L.D. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Kopel said she wanted to be as transparent as possible with students and she believes that students pay the most attention right before voting starts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s why I wanted to release it at that point, not to get any last minute votes or as a way to put myself up in the elections, but rather to reach as many students as possible when they’re paying attention,” Kopel said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CU executive candidates Sophia Dycaico, the candidate for Executive Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA), Madeline Loudon, the candidate for Executive Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) and Anthony Pimentel, the candidate for Internal Vice President (IVP), all confirmed they agree with Kopel’s statement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dycaico said she had always denounced the raising of student fees to renovate the UCen. Both Dycaico and Kopel told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Monday they believed an official statement was necessary to dispel rumours that Campus United supported the “NewCen” measure as a party.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many candidates support the renovation of the UCen; however, they disagree with raising student fees to complete the renovation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that funding should be coming from the state and the UC system and should definitely not be placed as a burden on students,” Loudon said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeike Meijer, the candidate for EVPLA with the Isla Vista Party, said that making students pay for the UCen sets a precedent for students paying for all on-campus renovations.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All four candidates running for executive positions with the Isla Vista Party also confirmed they do not support the raising of student fees to renovate the UCen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of them denounced the project before election season began, including Justice Dumlao, the IVP candidate for A.S. president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While I’m very glad that she finally is coming out in being against the NewCen project, I think it was just a little late,” Dumlao said. “I’m a little sad that it was late, but better late than never.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said he thought Kopel could have been more open about the fact that she was questioning her position on the NewCen project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao added that he believes Kopel might have felt she could not express her opinions on the ballot measure, as Hieu Le, the current A.S. President and main proponent of the “NewCen” project, ran with Campus United and is affiliated with the same party as Kopel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t want to pin it all on Brooke… I imagine it’s very difficult to denounce something that your current elected president is doing,” Dumlao said. “‘Better late than never’ is how I feel. There’s so many other circumstances that Brooke could have been under or pressured under.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked why she took a stance on the ballot so late in the election season, Kopel said she wanted to gather as much information as possible before making a decision and said she felt as though new facts were coming out about the UCen proposal everyday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I actually wanted to wait as long as I could to hear the most opinions I could,” Kopel added. “That is my job, to understand everybody’s ultimate sentiments toward this project.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mayela Morales, the candidate for External Vice President for Statewide Affairs with the Isla Vista Party, also commented on the timing of Kopel’s statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was a little disheartened to see Brooke coming out with the statement not because I don’t believe that she’s against it, but because students have been so vocal about it for a really long time,” Morales said. “I thought it was very strategic to post that right before voting started.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is always ‘better late than never,’ but I honestly think it was a little too late for her to say that,” Morales added. “I think it was a little too strategic; she could have said that a long time ago.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Between 20 to 25 rapes were reported from 2015 to 2017, according to the report.</p>\n<p>The most frequent location of sexual offense — which the report defined differently from sexual assault — is the UC Santa Barbara Library. Eight reports of sexual offenses occured at the UCSB Library, followed by six reports in the Santa Catalina residence hall.</p>\n<p>According to the report, the UCSB Police Department (UCPD) defines rape as any type of vaginal, anal or oral penetration without consent of the survivor. Sexual offense includes fondling, incest, statutory rape, indecent exposure, peeping and more.</p>\n<p>The report includes UCPD data recorded between 2015 to 2017 and a compilation of articles referring to sexual assault, “hookup culture” and attitudes concerning sexual encounters within Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara and the greater UC system from 2013 to 2017.</p>\n<p>UCSB students had included a sexual assault report card among a list of demands they presented last May to school administrators. In March, the CSD officially began preparing the report.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Community Services District (CSD) made several records requests to UCPD and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) for detailed information regarding sexual assault and misconduct cases. The information includes the specific location of the incidents that took place.</p>\n<p>IVFP denied the CSD’s request on the grounds that the information requested is confidential.</p>\n<p>However, the CSD’s legal counsel confirmed that sexual assault reports in the area are public information and the IVFP does not have proper grounds to withhold the information, according to CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud.</p>\n<p>The information, however, lacks critical details, such as the time the incidents occurred, more specific locations and more detailed classifications of the type of sexual violence.</p>\n<p>The board also voted to send a letter to the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office outlining the goals of the report and requesting more information.</p>\n<p>Matan Bostick, CSD public policy intern and author of the report, coded over 30 news articles into categories that best represent the phrases mentioned within each article.</p>\n<p>The category with the highest frequency among articles was “Issue[s] with UC process,” which refers to any problems survivors might have with the UC’s process of reporting sexual assault.</p>\n<p>The next most frequently cited categories were “Bad Results” and “Delays in Response Procedure.” These categories refer to any perceived injustice on the survivor’s behalf and a lack of appropriate and timely responses by police departments or university systems, respectively.</p>\n<p>Bostick used the data from UCPD to organize the information into graphs comparing variables such as location, type of sexual crime, frequency per month and the number of cases forwarded to the District Attorney’s (DA) office.</p>\n<p>UCPD distinguishes data relating to sexual violence between two categories: “sexual assault” and “sexual offense.”</p>\n<p>The data in the report shows that the number of reported sexual assaults increased by over 50 percent from 2015 to 2017. In each year, however, the majority of cases reported to UCPD were not forwarded to the DA’s office.</p>\n<p>Bostick said the shortage of cases forwarded to the DA’s office could be caused by a number of reasons, including a survivor’s choice to not press charges.</p>\n<p>The events “are just the tip of the iceberg, especially in regards to sexual offenses which were reported less frequently than sexual assaults,” Bostick said.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.5 of the May 10 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

I’m eating dinner with my girlfriend in Goleta while the Blackhawks play the Flyers in Game 3 of the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals. I check the score on my phone. It’s 2-2. There are two big screen TVs in the restaurant: one tuned to SportsCenter, the other to ESPNews. I ask the bartender if he can turn on the hockey game. “Sure, chief. No problem.”</p>\n<p>Ten minutes later I’m still watching ESPNews. Again, I go up to ask him to change it. He’s annoyed. He’s annoyed? I do the best I can to keep my cool, but it’s the Stanley Cup fucking Finals. He begrudgingly grabs the remote.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The championship series of one of the world’s major sports can’t get play over early-season baseball highlights. That’s Santa Barbara’s relationship with hockey in a nutshell. The bartender changed the channel to the NHL network — a repeat of a Bruins game from two years ago. But he can’t tell the difference.</p>\n<p>Hockey’s not a sport that translates well to a small screen. The camera follows the puck so your eyes follow the puck, but the overall picture is much more crucial. Hockey’s about momentum: It’s easier to understand if you can see the entire ice surface at once.</p>\n<p>Make your way across the border to Canada and you’ll notice that hockey’s prominence in the media equals America’s big three sports. If you live in Toronto and you’re not a Maple Leafs fan, people question why. If you live in Toronto and root for the Senators, you have thousands of enemies.</p>\n<p>Forsaking the sport completely in Canada is akin to living in Hollywood and not enjoying film. It just doesn’t make sense.</p>\n<p>Even in American hockey “hotbeds” like Boston and Minnesota, the hockey teams take a backseat to the Red Sox, the Patriots and the Celtics, the Twins and the Vikings.  The state of hockey is even more dire in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>If you want to understand hockey and keep up with the happenings of the sport in America (particularly on the West Coast) you really have to dig.</p>\n<p>The sport is a chain of ebbs and flows that demands sustained effort. Success is built step by step and requires intense precision. A team can’t score without getting the puck into the zone, which can’t happen without an individual effort to get the puck up the ice or to place an accurate pass through bodies and skates, which can’t happen without first getting the puck out of their zone and so on.</p>\n<p>All of these actions take place at high speed, on ice, on skates, with players the size of linebackers interrupting the puck carrier with body checks.</p>\n<p>Think of scoring a goal like climbing a ladder while getting attacked by bees. Then you’ll see that poise in the face of pressure is prized above all else.</p>\n<p>These are the kinds of things I wish someone would have explained to that bartender in Goleta. Rather than having to go back to the bar a third time, the game would have been on from the moment I walked in the door. I’d be discussing the Blackhawks’ breakout patterns and the Flyers’ goalie Michael Leighton and his poor positioning, with other hockey fans at the bar.</p>\n<p>Yet, when I write that faux-retrospective fantasy in a Santa Barbara state of mind, it seems ridiculous. I can count on both hands the people I know from around here with whom I would be able to have that kind of conversation.</p>\n<p>I love hockey. I want everyone to love hockey. Goddamn it, if I have to explain the sport on a fundamental level and build it from the ground up to get people interested, then that’s what I’ll do. It’s not just that I want more friends to talk hockey with, I think everyone deserves to at least have an understanding of the sport and give it a fair shake.</p>\n<p>People never give hockey a chance. The next time you’re flipping through channels and you come across a hockey game, stop, and even if you don’t completely understand what’s going on. If you find yourself confused, that’s OK. But if you find yourself intrigued, pursue that interest. It’s a beautiful sport, the greatest there is: I’m still impressed every day by the unpredictability and the endless possibilities of what 12 players on ice with sticks and a puck can do. Learn it and enjoy it. I promise you won’t regret it.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27813\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/deity-ice-case-hockey-america/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27813\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/deity-ice-case-hockey-america/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/deity-ice-case-hockey-america/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/deity-ice-case-hockey-america/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/deity-ice-case-hockey-america/","id":2271,"author":{"id":327,"name":"Josh Deitell"},"related":[2270,2269,2268],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Suspect Arrested for Stalking at On-Campus Residence Hall","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-05-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Facts-UCSB-Campus-by-Olivia-Consterdine-PRINT-2-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Facts-UCSB-Campus-by-Olivia-Consterdine-PRINT-2-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UC Santa Barbara Police Department arrested Minh Nguyen at San Rafael Residence Hall on Wednesday night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A 19-year-old UC Santa Barbara student was arrested Wednesday night on charges of stalking, according to the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>The UC Santa Barbara Police Department arrested Minh Nguyen at San Rafael Residence Hall at approximately 11:48 p.m. Wednesday night, according to Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) arrest records.</p>\n<p>Nguyen was booked in the Santa Barbara County Jail on charges of stalking and for “annoying repeated calls to residence,” according to SBSO.
