But with a fastball that consistently clocked in around the high 90s and a freakish breaking ball that made even the best professional hitters look like minor league washouts, Tim Lincecum was the best pitcher in baseball during a six-year run that saw him earn three world series championships, two Cy Young awards, two no-hitters, three strikeout titles and four All-Star appearances with the San Francisco Giants.</p>\n<p>The slightly built Lincecum, who grew up playing baseball in the neighborhood parks of Bellevue, Washington, was the centerpiece of a dominating Giants pitching staff from 2008-2014.</p>\n<p>His quirky delivery that produced a 98 mph fastball combined with pinpoint control and an uncanny ability to change speeds and locations, gained him a reputation as the best pitcher in baseball and ultimately garnered the nickname “The Freak.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Gregory Bull / Associated Press</p></div>\n<p>As dominating as The Freak was during his six-year reign, the last year of his career was anything but. He struggled with his control in 2015, and his once vaunted high 90s fastball had lost its punch.</p>\n<p>He was giving up runs in bunches, and the losses began to pile up as a result. He eventually lost his job in the starting rotation and questions swirled about whether he had reached the end of his career.</p>\n<p>Lincecum soon found himself out of professional baseball after not resigning with the Giants at the end of the 2015 season.</p>\n<p>In the offseason, doctors discovered a problem with the former two-time Cy Young winner’s hip. After a successful procedure, baseball writers quickly started presuming maybe the hip was the problem all along. Hopes began to rise that maybe Lincecum could dominate the big leagues once again.</p>\n<p>While recovering, Lincecum only thought about his comeback. He spent countless hours rehabbing his injury, attacking his regimen with the fearlessness that marked his professional baseball career.</p>\n<p>He worked hard, trying to find The Freak within his game yet again and fighting to bring himself to the level at which he expected himself to be. Slowly, he was able to take the mound once again. The velocity on his fastball improved, his control became more consistent and he soon began looking like a major league pitcher once again.</p>\n<p>In May of this year, he held a showcase for all major league teams, asking only that they give him a chance to prove his talents yet again. The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim liked what they saw and took a chance, signing him to a one-year contract later that month.</p>\n<p>On June 18, Tim Lincecum completed his comeback and took the mound in Oakland against the Athletics. All the previous years’ hard rehabilitation process had led to this moment, and the Washington native did not disappoint.</p>\n<p>In a six-inning effort, Lincecum picked up his first major league win since June 27 of 2015 after allowing only four hits and one earned run while striking out two batters. The six innings were the most he had pitched in a single outing since June 5 of last year as well.</p>\n<p>His hip showed no signs of lasting damage and he attacked major league hitters in a manner reminiscent of his glory days with the Giants. In his first major league game since being cut by the Giants, Lincecum proved he is well on his way to becoming a quality major league pitcher again.</p>\n<p>It looks like The Freak is here to stay.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71778\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-23/the-freak-is-back/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71778\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-23/the-freak-is-back/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-23/the-freak-is-back/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-23/the-freak-is-back/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-23/the-freak-is-back/","id":1927,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1926,1925,1924],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird","biography":"Not available","articles":[48,49,50,51,59,60,62,63,1118,1120,1123,1137,1138,1139,1140,1141,1142,1143,1144,1145,1148,1150,1176,1177,1178,1179,1183,1403,1406,1407,1410,1419,1421,1425,1426,1434,1436,1437,1444,1445,1447,1448,1449,1450,1451,1452,1455,1490,1494,1927,1928],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

It calls on the UC to end the use of all Proposition 65 herbicide on the campus, and asks the university to “notify students, faculty, and staff before any synthetic herbicides are sprayed at UCSB and in surrounding areas, including location and time details.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the resolution many of the synthetic herbicides used by the UC </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">such as glyphosate, oryzalin and 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are considered by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer to be probable carcinogens, meaning long-term exposure to such chemicals could be detrimental to human health.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the resolution states there have been a considerable number of court cases in California ruled that glyphosate-based herbicides had caused cancer, referencing one where, in August 2018, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">San Francisco Superior Court jury in the Dewayne Johnson v. Monsanto case found that glyphosate-based herbicide exposure was responsible for the plaintiff’s terminal cancer. Johnson was awarded $79 million. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The San Francisco Federal Court also ruled exposure to these same synthetic chemicals were the probable cause of cancer in another plaintiff, Hardeman, awarding him $80 million, according to the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This short-sighted outlook, on minimizing acute toxicity for maximum weed control, leaves our groundskeepers, communities and environments vulnerable to the long term impacts,” Sheina Crystal, student sponsor of the resolution, said in an interview.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The UC system should prioritize the health and safety of land managers, students, faculty and community members over campus aesthetics and band aid treatments.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A similar resolution was previously brought to the table at last year’s 69th Senate and also passed, but ultimately expired after the 70th senate took office.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Regents did temporarily suspend the use of glyphosate on all UC campuses, which came into effect in June 2019, with several exceptions, citing “concerns about possible human health and ecological hazards, as well as potential legal and reputational risks associated with this category of herbicides,” according to the </span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/july19/c4.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office of the President</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Various universities across the nation have already taken steps toward reducing and eliminating harmful herbicides on their campuses. The list stated in the resolution includes</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Colorado at Boulder, University of Arizona, Yale and the University of Michigan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concerns of the effects from these types of synthetic herbicides were first introduced to the UC in 2017 through the movement </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Herbicide-Free Cal, which effectively ended herbicide use on a number of spaces on the UC Berkeley campus, including its two largest green areas, according to the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A timeline for the proposed ban of these herbicides has not yet been established, but the resolution “asks that all responsible parties work diligently to ensure that the severity of the issue is addressed.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

will soon rule on the legality of the program. </span><em>Jessica Ko / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the direction of UC President Janet Napolitano, the UC Regents filed a lawsuit in September 2017 challenging President Trump’s announcement that he would end the program and took its stance as a defender of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a UC-wide service to help undocumented students: the UC Immigrant Legal Services Center. Based out of UC Davis, the program places an attorney at each UC campus who is available for legal assistance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the legal assistance, each UC has set aside resources for undocumented students, each with a program tailored to the needs of their respective campus. At UC Santa Barbara, this support comes from the Undocumented Student Services (USS). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program, located on the second floor of the Student Resource Building,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was officially established in 2014 through funding from the Office of the President set aside specifically for undocumented student services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diana Valdivia, coordinator for Undocumented Student Services, works with seven student interns to help undocumented students on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been working around undocumented students for five years, and prior to that I was organizing DACA legal clinics,” Valdivia said. “The passion of working with immigrant communities and having a masters in student affairs when these positions opened up were part of the reason for my interest.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valdivia has seen exponential growth in undocumented student services over the past three years in particular — both from overall growth of the new program as well as from heightened concerns from immigrant students when it was announced in 2017 that DACA would be rescinded, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When DACA was rescinded… we were seeing students [come in and] worry about, ‘What does that look like?’” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valdivia’s goal with Undocumented Student Services is to provide a “different narrative” for the greater campus about what it means to be undocumented. Last year, USS hosted seven separate trainings for people to learn about laws and policies impacting immigrant communities, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, each year during the third week of winter quarter, the center puts on an annual Immigration Awareness Week on campus, where it hosts a series of events to provide outreach about how to support the UCSB immigrant community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The services also offer a faculty mentorship program, which connects undocumented students to other students and faculty members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have socials for students, and then faculty also come to the socials, and then students get a chance to interact with them more in an informal mentor role,” Valdivia explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valdivia sees the connection between undocumented students and the greater UCSB population as beneficial to everyone, particularly as the Supreme Court goes through the DACA hearings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the times media might be focusing on the trauma, what it means to be undocumented and that’s totally valid,” Valvidia said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[It’s important] for us to be able to provide a different narrative.”</span></p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

contracted employees was passed by the UC Regents (pictured at an earlier meeting).</span> <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The policy comes on the heels of intense backlash from unions in response to the UC’s outsourcing practices. On Wednesday, workers represented by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME 3299) held their sixth strike in two years after the union filed <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-06/afscme-files-six-new-unfair-labor-practice-complaints-against-uc-plans-to-strike-nov-13/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573718186508000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE0IXQTx92iJhsPGSRrVXxo8SDUoQ\">six unfair labor practice complaints</a> against the UC in early November. A majority of the complaints addressed the UC’s alleged use of “secretive” contracts to outsource labor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the news of a policy aimed to internalize a majority of the UC’s workforce, AFSCME is not yet convinced this policy will clear the air on the alleged workforce offenses the UC has committed in the past. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over the last several years, thousands of UC service and patient care workers have stood together to expose the university’s unfair, unsafe and often illegal outsourcing of UC jobs. Now, after years of dismissing the problem and the racialized inequality it creates, the Board of Regents is finally acknowledging the need to change course,” the union said in a statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A “policy” isn’t worth the paper its [sic] printed on unless it is actually enforced… UC’s abysmal track record makes clear that only state legislation or binding contract language can deliver the accountability that’s needed to uplift UC’s most vulnerable low wage workers and to stop the university from outsourcing more jobs,” the union continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/nov19/g2attach.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573719471565000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFKJ1q3jBL_aDWK9Uf3jxQEf96lZw\">policy</a> would cover all campuses and affect a substantial amount of contractible services, such as custodial, food, healthcare and transportation services. No official date for the policy’s implementation has been set, but guidelines to roll out the policy would be established “no later” than Jan. 31, 2020, according to the policy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the umbrella of the new policy, the UC is allotted few instances in which outsourced labor will be permitted: if the services are needed in an emergency, if the UC is unable to provide the required equipment or personnel internally, if the services are related to property transactions, if the services would be more convenient to contract out or if services provided by “registry personnel in clinical operations” are not sufficient enough to respond to “staffing needs,” according to the policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The policy also offers contracted workers, who often work for lower wages and with fewer benefits, an opportunity to be adopted by the UC as university employees if the requirements for their employment are met. In turn, the “in-sourcing” of contracted employees will provide them with the full wages and salaries offered by the UC, according to the policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Individuals employed by service contractors who have provided those services to the University on a continuous basis for 12 months or more may request to be converted to University employment,” the policy continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the intake of contracted workers, employees under “covered services” — contracted services that are qualified to remain outsourced — are mandated by the new policy to be provided with “wages and benefits that are equivalent to the University wages and benefits provided to University employees performing the same work,” the policy read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, according to the policy, should “covered services” displace university employees, the university is required to open another position of a similar nature, which must “be in the same bargaining unit and at the same campus, medical center, or Laboratory” and provide matching wages and benefits corresponding to the displaced position.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, the new policy is expected to incur roughly an additional $108 million in costs for the UC, as stated at the meeting; the number was calculated by factoring in the cost of supplementing contracted work for insourced work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent Richard Leib commented on the policy at Wednesday’s Governance Committee meeting, predicting that the UC, as the third largest employer in California, may encounter difficulty implementing the policy as “there are certain administrative tasks that are going to make it difficult for our campuses who are under a lot of other pressures.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, he maintained that implementing the policy will better reflect the values of the UC and those who work for it.“This is the right thing to do,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the prospect for better employment opportunities, wages and benefits through the policy, Todd Stenhouse, communication director for AFSCME, said the union was still doubtful. Stenhouse said three bills passed through the California Legislature between 2015 and 2017 — SB 574, 959and 376 — all of which attempted to “ensure commensurate pay between contractors and employees who do the same job.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC “very publicly and vocally” lobbied to kill the three bills, all of which were vetoed by Governor Jerry Brown, Stenhouse said. Decisions like these pose a significant threat to employees, he said, especially those where financial insecurity constantly looms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These are not individuals that can afford to say, ‘Hey, you know, I’m good without a day’s pay,’” Stenhouse said. “These are people that don’t make a lot of money as it is. They see the pain and the harm and the insecurity that these practices have allowed to fester.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Stenhouse sees the policy as a sign of “progress” to AFSCME, the new policy “is hardly a finish line.” Stenhouse wants to see the UC keep its word and carry out on procedures that have been long overdue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a matter of concern across the state. We’re talking about communities across California. We’re talking about thousands of very vulnerable workers who are effectively doing the same jobs in many cases, full time, in many cases for years on end,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A first-class university does not have second-class workers. It is certainly high time for the University of California to not only talk the talk but to walk the walk.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Update [Nov. 15, 5:50 p.m.]: This article has been updated to include information about the full Regents’ vote on Thursday. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
