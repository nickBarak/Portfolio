the CDPH reports to the CDC, which then reports to the World Health Organization, Javanbakht said. The chain of command, however, is not a strict hierarchy, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a student exhibits coronavirus symptoms, Javanbakht said the university would notify the SB County Public Health Department about the potential case, which will advise Student Health as to whether or not to test the individual based on “how suspicious” their case is or the likelihood that they may have coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it’s a pretty suspicious [case], then the next step is, ‘Okay, who else could have been exposed?’ And if it’s a student, that [case] comes back to us,” Javanbakht said. “And if that student’s symptoms are in line with the guidelines, that’s someone that we need to test.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But students don’t always go straight to Student Health, Javanbakht said. It’s up to the SB County Public Health Department to notify Student Health if a student exhibits symptoms somewhere else, such as at a local emergency room or urgent care, he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Student Health and the SB County Public Health Department reasonably suspect that a student may have coronavirus, the public health department will work to pin down who they’ve been in contact with in the past two weeks to “expand that circle,” according to Javanbakht.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an example, Javanbakht said the SB County Public Health Department would calculate the risk a potentially infected student posed to their classmates by sending someone to campus to survey the features of classroom spaces, including looking at the room’s dimensions and the space between tables or desks to determine which students may have been exposed if a student had coronavirus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, Javanbakht said Student Health would work with the registrar’s office to find people who were potentially exposed to coronavirus and would let them know that “they might need to be tested.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a student does test positive for coronavirus, Javanbakht said the SB County Public Health Department would contact individuals who were “close enough to be exposed” and instruct them to isolate themselves and “find their own room separate from everyone else.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For people who had a low-risk exposure, Javanbakht said they could still go about their day but said that it was important to report symptoms as soon as possible, because “then we need to intervene.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If UCSB runs out of space to house exposed students, Javanbakht said the SB County Public Health Department will provide the university with additional space. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of that, UCSB and Isla Vista are notorious for their often-cramped living situations, so “if people are in close quarters,” Javanbakht said, “that’s absolutely a factor.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This stuff tends to live on surfaces, and if you have a lot of people close [to each other] touching the common surfaces, yeah, the risk tends to be higher than someone who’s out on a farm by themselves,” he added, stressing the importance of keeping good hygiene.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To keep the campus community informed about the coronavirus, Student Health has sent a number of emails to the student body in the past two months to quell concerns and provide updates on potential cases. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Behind the scenes, Javanbakht said Student Health has reached out to campus entities that deal with a high volume of students, such as the Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises, the Department of Recreation and the University Library, to detail hygiene methods that can decrease the spread of coronavirus on campus, such as using hand sanitizer and reminding students to wash their hands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a Feb. 13 emergency operations meeting, a number of campus representatives met to discuss a potential response to coronavirus cases on campus, with each representative giving feedback on what resources they could provide in case of an outbreak on campus, Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht also noted that all five UC medical centers and all 10 UC campuses participate in a twice-a-week phone call with the UC Office of the President (UCOP) to share information about positive and potential coronavirus cases.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student Health is also in contact with the UCOP medical director, who works with the medical directors at each UC campus to inform them about ongoing cases at universities outside the UC and their efforts to treat and contain them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Javanbakht said Student Health is in the midst of preparing a message for the student body about coronavirus and traveling for spring break, as many students are a couple weeks away from packing their bags and leaving Santa Barbara to go home or on vacation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht said the message will warn students about traveling to countries impacted by coronavirus and the possibility of being quarantined in another country or being isolated when returning to campus, he said. It will also include a reminder to report any possible symptoms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So between now and the end of spring break, as developments come up, if something changes, if there’s a new area of activity that we need to be concerned about, then we send messages again,” Javanbakht added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As coronavirus spreads, so does fear, which Javanbakht stressed as the “biggest threat to our campus.” Social media and rumors can instill fears that aren’t real or rational, and news headlines can trigger “fear mongering” if written poorly, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If all you’re looking at is coronavirus updates, over time, it can give a really distorted view and some people can take on what’s called a catastrophic view — that this is a catastrophe,” he said. “Realistically speaking, right now, the risk to 24,000 students on this campus [is] still relatively low.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Again, things might change but overall, right now, go about your day [and] practice good hand hygiene,” Javanbakht said. “We’re doing everything we can.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

But ESPN’s presentation of the 2018 NBA draft stood out from their previous blunders in ways that left me wondering how anyone else was taking in the barrel of chum that was this year’s coverage. A few looks at social media confirmed that I’m not crazy (take that, my therapist), and also not the only one to cringe at every forced player comparison made and blatantly-misguided interview question asked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s unfortunate that any draft day should warrant this kind of criticism because, after all, it should be about the players selected, a majority of whom are younger than half of UCSB’s undergrads. In fact, 11 of 14 players selected in this year’s lottery are 19 or younger. ESPN should not only highlight these newcomers but should provide insightful basketball analysis, instead of reality-TV content. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any analysis, especially insightful, is a stretch for today’s ESPN, but some of last night’s commentary was simply disappointing. The top prospects of this year have been talked about for months now, so there was a real opportunity presented for the network to capture the long-awaited selections with a dialogue pointing to the next step for the draftees and their respective franchises. Instead, the well-known highlights of each player were reiterated with little acknowledgement of where the players were headed. It doesn’t take the notion of draft night to once again explain Deandre Ayton’s athleticism, or Luka Doncic’s success overseas. On draft night, it should be about what’s next for them in the league. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the immediate moments following the announced destination of each prospect, the chance to talk NBA basketball was missed. In the case of Ayton, a player expected to go No. 1 in the draft for quite a while, his destination was only touched upon. The Suns have exceptional young talent to welcome Ayton; however, the brief mention of Ayton’s future teammates was underwhelming and hardly informative. Perhaps the aspect of time between picks hampored any detailed analysis, so maybe the section of the show devoted to player introductions should’ve been a time for actual NBA commentary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Player introductions, which were done for the first (and hopefully last) time in draft history last night, should’ve been the first sign of botched coverage. Most of the expected lottery picks were featured walking down the stage with family members or friends alongside them, which is great for celebrating the players, except every player already gets plenty of camera time once the actual draft begins. Players are shown, oftentimes with their friends and family, awaiting picks at their tables, on stage with commissioner Adam Silver, being interviewed after they’re picked, and the abundance of media obligations awaiting them after their interviews. Why would the players need even more screen-time? Because the ESPN commentators actually have that little of importance to say. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"766937373\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83582\"><img data-attachment-id=\"83583\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-22/how-espn-ruined-the-2018-nba-draft/2018-nba-draft-logo-640x360/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg?fit=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,360\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640×360\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg?fit=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83583\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg?resize=640%2C360\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-NBA-Draft-logo-640x360.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning with Chauncey Billups, who earned my respect as a player during his Detroit years, Billups’ segment of player comparisons was terrible and frankly a waste of time. It’s understandable why comparing young draft picks to past and present NBA players is helpful in characterizing a players’ potential, but some comparisons appeared forced and few were reasonable. Aside from the weird trend of matching the race of pick and compared player, Billups failed to match playstyles altogether. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jaren Jackson Jr., selected fourth, was compared to Joakim Noah. As Billups made this comparison, Jackson Jr.’s highlights were shown with him spreading the floor and hitting threes. Joakim Noah, as anyone who’s watched him play should know, isn’t a big three point shooter, or shooter in general. Noah has an NBA career three point percentage of 0.00. Billups had to have done some preparation for the top prospects and their comparisons, and obviously it’s uncertain how every draftee will turn out, but some of his choices made it seem like he was drawing names out of segregated hats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the racially-aligned player comparisons weren’t awkward enough, the post-draft interviews for each player picked up the slack. After being picked, shaking the commissioners’ hand and walking across the stage, the players then faced a barrage of poor interview questions. Simply pointless questions regarding “the moment” and “what their team can expect” were repeated for each pick, with equally repetitive answers. How else are they supposed to feel? They just got drafted by an NBA team as a teenager, we’re sure that’s awful. And immediately after being drafted they had to sell themselves as a player again? It was ridiculous and a blatant move by ESPN trying to generate drama.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standing out among the interviews was Colin Sexton’s. Following his selection at 8th overall by Cleveland, Sexton was coaxed by the interviewer to make a pitch for LeBron to stay. Talk about awkward. Anything the Cavs do to retain The King will likely include packaging their newest draft pick in a trade for another star, just like they did with Andrew Wiggins in 2014. As if Sexton was supposed to say, ‘LeBron please stay, I promise I’ll know the score during the final seconds of a playoff game.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of it all, ESPN reporter and columnist Adrian Wojnarowski tweeted out virtually every pick before it happened, which only cheapens the draft coverage itself even further. Maybe my sports expectations are too high for a Disney-owned company, and maybe the point of the show is to be just that, a show. But, the difficulty of finding non-conglomerate, real-time draft news should indicate where the dominating national sports coverage is heading. If the NBA draft is developing into a reality show, how soon until other ESPN/ABC (both Disney) NBA events like All-Star Weekend and End of Year Awards are ruined? Oh wait. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83582\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-22/how-espn-ruined-the-2018-nba-draft/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83582\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-22/how-espn-ruined-the-2018-nba-draft/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-22/how-espn-ruined-the-2018-nba-draft/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-22/how-espn-ruined-the-2018-nba-draft/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-22/how-espn-ruined-the-2018-nba-draft/","id":1849,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[1848,1847,1846],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“We’re monitoring the entire world at this point”: UCEAP Suspends Three Study Abroad Programs Due to Coronavirus","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-03-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/UCEAP-Melody-Wang-Daily-Nexus.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/UCEAP-Melody-Wang-Daily-Nexus.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The China study abroad program was cancelled at the end of January;

At first, there were three confirmed cases in Italy around Feb. 24, Woo said. But in the next four days, the number of confirmed cases skyrocketed to around 400, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With all of this happening, a lot of the students, all the people I talked to about it, they were just kind of talking about it amongst ourselves because the school didn’t really say anything about it,” Woo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Woo said she wasn’t as concerned about the virus itself, particularly because it is more dangerous for the elderly and people with illnesses, she said she was worried that she would have to be quarantined once she returned, which could affect her spring quarter enrollment at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was just afraid that, knowing [President Donald Trump], that he was gonna implement a travel ban and do something drastic that could leave us like stranded [in Italy],” Woo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even if we came back at the same day that we’re supposed to, if we got quarantined for two weeks, that would mean that’d we’d miss the first week of classes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the days leading up to the program’s suspension, Woo said she was frequently checking news sites and getting traveler alerts about the increasing risk in Italy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the university did send emails to students to let them know it was monitoring the situation, Woo and several other students emailed UCEAP coordinators criticizing the minimal communication from UCEAP, particularly as the situation in Italy began to develop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though [UCEAP] said they were monitoring the situation, they didn’t really give updates, they just kind of gave us a link a couple days ago and told us to check on it ourselves,” Woo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students that I was talking to knew a lot more about the situation than the school itself, or at least what the school was telling us, which was really frustrating.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About a day before the Italy program was officially suspended, Woo said students received an email saying that they could choose to withdraw from the program early. But Woo noted that, for many students, buying a last-minute plane ticket isn’t financially feasible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it’s a quote unquote optional thing, it’s not really optional for those students,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the program was officially suspended on Feb. 28, UCEAP told students they could submit claims to be reimbursed for their tickets for up to $2,000. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Woo and other students in the Florence program only received four units per course as opposed to five due to the program suspension. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While no programs beyond Italy, South Korea and China have been suspended so far, Edmond said UCEAP was “monitoring the entire world at this point.” As of Wednesday evening, the New York Times </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that at least 95,400 people across the globe had the virus, and that people in at least 80 countries had been infected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who are preparing to go abroad are being told to continue as if their programs will be held, according to Edmond.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jasmine Khamenian, a third-year communication major, is scheduled to study abroad in Japan for spring quarter through UCEAP, but Japan is currently at a Level Two alert. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In three weeks, I have a plane ticket to go abroad for spring quarter in Japan, and everything’s set, my plan has been to go third-year, spring quarter, but obviously the coronavirus and everything has kind of put me in a limbo,” Khamenian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everything’s prepped for me to go abroad, but I don’t actually know if I’m going abroad.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Japan, elementary through high schools were recently shut down, but there haven’t been any cancellations for universities so far, the New York Times </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/world/asia/japan-schools-coronavirus.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCEAP is telling me, ‘We’ll let you know if CDC says it’s Level 3’ … in that case we don’t go, but that could be when I’m in Japan in three weeks, and it can be the second day there, and they could be like, ‘Oh yeah, actually go back,’” Khamenian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the possibility of her study abroad program being cancelled, Khamenian would have to deal with finding housing and registering for classes, which she doesn’t think would be a possibility so last minute. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know if I should pack for going abroad or for going home for break only,” Khamenian added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s so many things up in the air.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the March 5, 2020 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
