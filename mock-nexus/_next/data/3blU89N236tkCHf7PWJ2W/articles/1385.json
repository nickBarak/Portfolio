The defender knocked in her first goal of the year off of Colby Parker’s corner kick, and the moment was even more special as it was her last game as a Gaucho.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rest of the first half played out evenly for both sides, although UCSB did get off many more shots than Cal Poly a number of quality shots for both squads were pretty equal and the goalkeepers for both squads had to make multiple saves to keep their teams alive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The physical nature of the Blue-Green rivalry also was present in the first half, even if it was the Gauchos who were often the aggressors (they doubled Cal Poly’s foul count in the first half 8-4) both squads had plenty of hard challenges that contributed to the chippy atmosphere.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mustangs must have taken the physicality to heart as they came out guns blazing in the second half, and found the mark in the 47th minute of the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again it was a senior scoring in her last game, except this time it was midfielder Emily Hansen who knocked in the game-tying goal after Brittney Rogers couldn’t corral a Cal Poly freekick.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB dominated the half, however, tallying seven shots to Cal Poly’s one the Gauchos were operating at a high level on the offensive end for the last 40 minutes of the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They weren’t able to put one shot past Mustang goalkeeper Sophie Brown however as the sophomore had a stellar half, stopping four shots in the half itself and totaling nine on the day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The saves didn’t seem to affect the Gauchos who continued to attack the Cal Poly goal until the very last minute of regulation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going into the first overtime not much changed for the Gauchos while Cal Poly brought three pairs of fresh legs in. It was UCSB who looked like they had a boost of energy however as they put three shots on goals in the first overtime period, and if not for the heroics of Brown they almost certainly would have ended up winning the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The keeper made the three saves, however, and neither team took a shot in the second overtime period leading to the 1-1 tie.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this wasn’t the result the Gauchos hoped for coming into their season finale, the game actually provided a lot of positives going into the offseason. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The play of Christine Maurer continues to be a shining spot as the freshman showed countless times this year that she has potential to be a top player in the league in the coming years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The great defense that the team played on Sunday also was emblematic of how good UCSB has been defensively to end the year. Although the result wasn’t everything the Gauchos wanted it to be, they played hard and played great soccer, which fittingly is a good analogy for how the 2017-18 season went.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

The midfielder scored six goals for UCSB this year, good for second on the team, and earned a starting spot and leading role for years to come. Her goal total was the most tallied by a freshman within the program’s last two seasons.</p>\n<p>Schornstein and Ball were both selected to the All-Big West First Team, the former making it for the first time while the latter ends her career with two first-team selections.</p>\n<p>The two played vastly different roles but were both vital for the success of the team over the last four years. Schornstein was a defensive stalwart during her time at UCSB and had both the tasks of maintaining the defense and creating the attack. Her ability to do both so well was what led to her starting 75 of 77 possible games in her career.</p>\n<p>Ball, on the other hand, was one of the greatest attacking threats UCSB has ever had, and this year she became the first UCSB player in a decade to score 10 goals or more in consecutive seasons. She led the Big West in goals (10) and points (22) and consistently carried the Gauchos to victory when the team wasn’t playing well as a whole. The impact that these three players had this year was immense; however, the team as a whole still had some setbacks that they will certainly look to address in the offseason.</p>\n<p>One focus for the Gauchos going into next season will be tightening things up on the defensive side of the field. UCSB gave up more goals than all but two other teams in the league this year, tying Cal Poly at 25, which is a statistic that Head Coach Paul Stumpf will surely want to correct going into his 20th season.</p>\n<p>Still, that stat is partially deceiving, as the Gauchos did not give up more than two goals in a game in their last month of play, which shows that they have the potential to become one of the stingiest defenses in the Big West.</p>\n<p>However, two glaring questions remain going into next year: Can UCSB maintain consistency on the defensive end for the length of an entire season? And how is it going to fare with two of its best defensive presences in Schornstein and senior defender Kate Shoemaker having already played their last games as Gauchos this past Sunday?</p>\n<p>Another big question is going to be how the Gauchos will replace the offensive production of Ball, who was a huge reason that UCSB ended the season as one of the top offensive teams in the conference.</p>\n<p>UCSB finished fourth in the league in goals (24) and third in the league in assists (23), which is a good indicator moving forward that the majority of its goals were a byproduct of good ball movement and passing and not just the result of amazing skill by Ball, who deserves acclaim for her production.</p>\n<p>As mentioned before, one answer to this question of offensive production that the Gauchos will surely be hoping for is the continued improvement of Maurer, following the newcomer’s standout season. Although Ball is leaving some huge shoes to fill, Maurer seems more than capable of taking on a bigger role as she transitions into her second year.</p>\n<p>This last season was rough at times. The Gauchos lost to teams they should have beat and couldn’t put together enough wins to qualify for the postseason.</p>\n<p>Yet, the determination of the players to continue to improve, to play their best defense at the end of the season and ultimately to give it their all every time they were out on the field made it so that even with the losses this season, it could be considered nothing less than a success and a learning experience.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

The Gauchos have one more home game against Sacramento State and will play their final game of the regular season at Cal Poly on Saturday night.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Davis managed to put up its first point on the board in the eighth minute when senior Greg Salazar serviced a well-placed pass to a waiting Adam Mickelson, who sent a shot off his left foot past the Gauchos freshman goalie Alan Carrillo.</p>\n<p>Mickelson’s goal was just the beginning to the Aggies’ barrage of goals as they continued to create scoring chances. In the 33rd minute, redshirt junior forward Matt Baringer found himself on the receiving end of a deflection, which he fired into the net for his fifth goal of the season. The unassisted effort added on to the team’s early lead, increasing the Aggies’ lead to 2-0, landing the Gauchos in an even deeper ditch.</p>\n<p>Right before the end of the first half, in the 41st minute, senior defender Kyle Higgins found himself on the breakaway while dribbling a pass from teammate Onah Power, managing to get past a Davis defender to find the back of the net.</p>\n<p>The first half was brought to an end with the Aggies on top 3-0, bringing back deja vu of the two teams’ previous match which ended with a 3-0 shutout victory.</p>\n<p>By halftime, the Gauchos defense had given up five shots to the Aggies and Carrillo did not manage to make a single save. The defense was shaky in the first half and was able to constantly create chances on the offensive end. The Davis defense was able to hold the Gauchos to no shots at halftime, as the home team just could not get too many good looks at the net.</p>\n<p>The second half kicked off and it was much of the same from the Davis offense. The rhythm the team had found in the first half had clearly continued into the second, with the team being able to notch another point on the board when Power was able to find senior Noah Wilson to make the game 4-0, in the 57th minute. Power notched his first two assists of the season to tie him for third best on the team.</p>\n<p>It was only five minutes later that the Aggies were able to score again with Mickelson striking yet again for his fourth goal on the season. The game ended 5-0 in favor of Davis.</p>\n<p>The multi-point nights from multiple Aggies in Saturday’s matchup were an indicator of the Gauchos’ collapse on defense. Excluding the first goal, each half had the scores occur within ten minutes of each other.</p>\n<p>The Aggies’ various quick bursts on offense were able to cut through the Gauchos’ defense, who left too many open looks, too many times on the pitch. Davis finished with 12 shots, of which half were shots on goal.</p>\n<p>Carrillo ended the match with just one save. It was a tough night for the keeper who was outstanding in play last week. The UCSB offense was able to take four shots in the second half, but forced the Davis keepers to only make one save. Senior midfielder Seo-in Kim was responsible for both of the Gauchos’ two shots on goal.</p>\n<p>The five goals allowed and no goals scored performance by the Gauchos is a sign that the team and Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg have some corrections to make upon the postseason’s arrival in the first week of November.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79234\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-23/gauchos-endure-worst-home-loss-in-more-than-25-years/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79234\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-23/gauchos-endure-worst-home-loss-in-more-than-25-years/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-23/gauchos-endure-worst-home-loss-in-more-than-25-years/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-23/gauchos-endure-worst-home-loss-in-more-than-25-years/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-23/gauchos-endure-worst-home-loss-in-more-than-25-years/","id":1383,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1382,1381,1380],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Attempts Season Sweep Over Sac St. in Final Home Match","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsUCR-170930-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsUCR-170930-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos are hoping to shake a devastating 5-0 loss to UC Davis over the weekend in its home finale versus Sac St Wednesday night.

Entering Wednesday, two matches remain on the Gauchos’ schedule. Now, much more is on the line as UCSB is not only trying to defend its home turf, but is also fighting for the No. 1 seed in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Coming off a 5-0 loss to current first place UC Davis, Santa Barbara currently sits in second place with 14 points in the Big West Northern division standings. Following closely behind with 13 points is third place Sacramento State, who recently routed Cal Poly last weekend by a score of 5-1.</p>\n<p>Wednesday will be the second meeting between the Gauchos and Hornets this season. Both teams initially faced each other last Wednesday at Hornet Field, which resulted in a 2-1 OT win for UCSB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For the majority of the first match, both teams were knotted at one goal apiece. In the end, the Gauchos came out on top and handed the Hornets their third loss of their conference schedule.</p>\n<p>Following their collapse against the Aggies over the weekend, the Gauchos’ defensive line will need to clean up its play to put themselves in the best position to possibly win. UCSB will be forced to keep its head on a swivel against a Hornets’ offense that is potent on the offensive end. Sac State currently boasts 11 different scorers on the year, who have combined for a total of 26 goals. In comparison, the Gauchos only have seven different scorers on the team and a combined total of 17 goals.</p>\n<p>More specifically, UCSB’s defensive agenda should have the names of Sac State’s two most productive players – Christian Webb and Justin Bedig – circled on its radar. Midfielder/forward Christian Webb currently still stands as his team’s leading goal scorer with six goals.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bedig found himself doing both scoring and playmaking last week with a goal and assist for his team. Both players will enter Wednesday still with a hot hand approach, as the UCSB defense, led by freshman goalkeeper Alan Carillo, will hope to prevent the two from having many scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>As much as a defensive battle, UCSB’s offense will look for a repeat performance from its last time out against Sac State. In the 2-1 OT victory, it was freshman forward Rodney Michael’s moment as he notched both goals, including the golden goal, to lead the Gauchos to their victory.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it’ll be up to the playmaking abilities of sophomore Ignacio Tellechea and senior defender Randy Mendoza, in addition to the hopeful return of sophomore forward Noah Billingsley who was absent in the Gauchos’ lopsided loss, that will be influential factors upon UCSB’s chance of winning in its final bout at Harder Stadium. All three players have contributed to a combined total of seven team assists on the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will host the visiting Sac State Hornets this Wednesday, Oct. 25 at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79281\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-25/ucsb-attempts-season-sweep-over-sac-st-in-final-home-match/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79281\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-25/ucsb-attempts-season-sweep-over-sac-st-in-final-home-match/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-25/ucsb-attempts-season-sweep-over-sac-st-in-final-home-match/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-25/ucsb-attempts-season-sweep-over-sac-st-in-final-home-match/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-25/ucsb-attempts-season-sweep-over-sac-st-in-final-home-match/","id":1384,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1383,1382,1381],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
