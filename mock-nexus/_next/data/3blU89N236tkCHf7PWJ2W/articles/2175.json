Senate members and Boards, Committees and Units (BCUs) with environmental mission statements — including the Environmental Affairs Board, Human Rights Board and Coastal Fund — to write letters to the Board of Supervisors declaring their opposition.</p>\n<p>The resolution also asks Chancellor Henry T. Yang to “reaffirm his previous commitments against fossil fuels” by issuing a statement against the project.</p>\n<p>“[The resolution] will both pressure our elected officials on a bigger scale and give environmental lobbyists more weight when they’re talking to the Board of Directors making this decision,” Solomon stated in an email to the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday’s meeting, the resolution’s student sponsors — fourth-year environmental studies and Chicana and Chicano studies major Amanda Pantoja and second-year computer science major Dylan Kupsh — both emphasized the importance of students speaking out and signing petitions against the proposals.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the supervisors got in because of student efforts, so we want them to hear what we have to say,” Pantoja said. “UCSB itself is one of the greenest campuses. I want to ensure we reflect our green values in the community.”</p>\n<p>Pantoja pointed out during the meeting that the Cat Canyon Proposals contradict California State Senate bill <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB100\">100</a>, which puts California on the path for 100 percent fossil fuel-free electricity by 2045.</p>\n<p>“Going with these projects would go against what Santa Barbara and Goleta have voted for,” she added.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors will vote on these measures in early 2019, according to Kupsh. Currently, the supervisors are editing proposed Final Environmental Impact Reports.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Yang and Lisa Przekop, director of the Office of Admissions at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Chuck Haines, assistant chancellor of the Office of Budget and Planning at UCSB, addressed the assembly with concerns about the current state of the school’s physics program.</p>\n<p>There has not been a “permanent increase” in facility space for the physics department since 1994, according to Haines.</p>\n<p>He cited a shortage of space for students majoring in physics despite a 300 percent increase in the number of physics students since 2006.</p>\n<p>Haines proposed UCSB construct a new physics building, which would encompass 125,000 square feet of space and cost $165 million. According to the meeting agenda, a source of funding has not been verified.</p>\n<p>Across campus, the most recent classroom building was constructed in 1967, but the school has recently received preliminary project approval from the UC Regents to construct a new building, according to Haines.</p>\n<p>In addition to core funding, campus revenue will also be used to develop the building, which will hold 2,300 new classroom seats, he said.</p>\n<p>Housing has also become a primary concern for the campus as the increase in residents exceeded the school’s intended capacity by about 1,200 students, according to the meeting agenda.</p>\n<p>The university plans to make space for 5,000 more beds by 2025 as part of their Long Range Development Plan (LRDP), according to the meeting agenda.</p>\n<p>Currently, 1,500 of the 5,000 beds have already been constructed through the development of the San Joaquin and Sierra Madre living spaces, Haines said.</p>\n<p>To fulfill the remainder of the LRDP plan, Haines proposed renovating existing housing sites such as Storke Apartments and the Channel Islands residence halls “to increase density and build additional housing.”</p>\n<p>For the development of faculty housing, UCSB has taken a different route.</p>\n<p>The college plans to narrow Ocean Road, leaving more room for the development of roughly 540 residential faculty units, Haines said.</p>\n<p>Not only will this bring faculty housing closer to campus, but Haines hopes that it will also bring a faculty presence to Isla Vista, attracting different businesses to the area and bringing steady activity to businesses during the summer and holiday seasons.</p>\n<p>The school plans to carry out this project through a third-party developer, which Haines believes they will begin to look for sometime in 2019.</p>\n<p>Campus buildings — many of which are “at the end of their useful life” — are requiring more money and maintenance over time, Haines said.</p>\n<p>The effects of old equipment spill over to laboratories as well, forcing faculty members to work with old equipment that does not always support their research. This is known to stifle UCSB’s faculty recruitment process, according to Haines.</p>\n<p>Haines noted that the school has used one-time state funds to fix critical building system problems in the past, but options are running out as “the backlogs are significant and the problems are growing larger.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85196\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85196\" data-attachment-id=\"85196\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-02/assembly-budget-subcommittee-discusses-current-needs-and-future-changes/sanya-kamidi_budget-meeting_online-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1488&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1488\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Sanya Kamidi_Budget Meeting_ONLINE (2)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=888%2C661&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85196\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=888%2C661\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"661\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=768%2C571&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C762&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85196\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>As the discussion turned to funding, local assemblymember Monique Limón asked the panel how they plan to prepare for the next recession.</p>\n<p>Martin Shumaker, executive director of the Office of Budget and Planning at UCSB, explained that he and Haines are cautious about putting money into “permanent obligations.”</p>\n<p>Shumaker added that UCSB has been “frugal” about its staffing in an attempt to do “more with less.” UCSB’s concern with the success of its programs and which programs will receive funding in the future is an example of this practice, Shumaker said.</p>\n<p>Non-academic services, also known as auxiliaries, have been noted to provide the university with sizable additional revenue, he said.</p>\n<p>Shumaker also recommended the university “look at philanthropy and grow that side of the campus to create revenue,” as this can help fill the holes caused by previous recessions in 2008 and 2012.</p>\n<p>Limón explained that as a higher education facility, UC and CSU campuses do not receive funding from Proposition 98, which provides funding for California Community Colleges. This lack of annual funding poses further challenges in the way of sourcing revenue.</p>\n<p>Another concern regarding enrollment is attracting out-of-state and international students. Haines said he believes the price of tuition is not competitively priced, comparable to that of Ivy League universities.</p>\n<p>Out-of-state tuition practices, such as the school’s refusal to give financial aid to residents outside California, diminishes its demand from an out-of-state perspective, Haines said.</p>\n<p>Przekop added that many schools aiming to recruit California residents offer scholarships that UCSB cannot match.</p>\n<p>Concerns are different for in-state students, according to California Assemblymember Kevin McCarty, who serves as the chair of the committee. The average yearly rate for room and board at UC Santa Barbara is $15,273.</p>\n<p>But room and board, unlike tuition, is not covered with money from traditional Pell Grants or UC Blue and Gold Opportunity Plans, forcing roughly 40 percent of the student body living in residence halls to either find applicable scholarships or take out loans.</p>\n<p>These loans incur an average of $20,000 to $30,000 of debt following graduation, according to McCarty.</p>\n<p>Recently, UCSB has ramped up efforts to support its students during economic hardships and times of distress, according to the meeting agenda.</p>\n<p>For example, UCSB has developed meal, grocery store and housing voucher programs; a financial crisis response team; a food boarding program to help students cook communally; and a CalFresh campaign, which registered roughly 3,000 students and brought $5 million worth of resources to UCSB students.</p>\n<p>With many projects and policies set for implementation in the coming years, the potential effects on the campus and its community are still unknown, Jackson said.</p>\n<p>However, Chancellor Yang remains optimistic.</p>\n<p>“We must not compromise the qualities of education and diversity,” Yang said during the meeting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

response to a lot of questions that people had [regarding the union strikes],” Isabella Liu, vice director and head of publicity USAS, said.</p>\n<p>“We just wanted to educate people and give them a space to communicate and open up dialogue where dialogue hasn’t been opened.”</p>\n<p>In October, several hundred UC workers went on their <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-23/afscme-begins-second-strike-of-the-year/\">second strike of the year</a>. The workers, represented by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), protested low wages and job outsourcing, among other issues.</p>\n<p>AFSCME is the the largest union of UC employees in California.</p>\n<p>Juan Donato, a lead groundskeeper who has worked at UCSB for 35 years, spoke during the panel about the strikes and working at UCSB.</p>\n<p>He said he found the AFSCME union to be a channel through which his voice could be heard.</p>\n<p>“Fortunately, UCSB is a public school, so we get to ask questions,” Donato said. “Unfortunately, when I ask questions myself, it doesn’t work. I get muted. But together with the union, we are strong. With the union, I have a voice.”</p>\n<p>Anna Fabian, a fourth-year AFSCME intern, spoke of learning about the labor movement as she went through her four years at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Coming to UCSB, I didn’t know much about the labor movement and I didn’t know about the hypocrisy that happens here,” Fabian said. “We learn so much in our classes about the mistreatment of workers, but it’s happening right outside our classrooms.”</p>\n<p>“After you learn so much about what is happening, you can’t just turn around and not do anything about it.”</p>\n<p>One-fifth of UC workers have faced discrimination in the workplace based on their cultural background, one-third reported not being paid overtime and one-half reported being overworked, according to a survey conducted by USAS.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the majority of workers reported not being paid a living wage.</p>\n<p>AFSCME members said during the panel they will continue to push for change, despite the fact that no changes came out of the October strikes.</p>\n<p>“We may not be able to see the results in our time, but it’s the legacy that I want to leave,” Donato said.</p>\n<p>“For my children, for the children of my grandchildren — in the long term, it is going to be worth it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

id=\"caption-attachment-85022\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Patrisse Cullors spoke at UCSB on Nov. 15. <em>Katelyn Zamudio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The event, put on by the UCSB MultiCultural Center (MCC), has been in the making for nearly nine months, according to MCC Director Zaveeni Khan-Marcus.</p>\n<p>“[Cullors’] voice and the message she gives is so powerful. We felt that it was important for her to come to campus and talk about her experience,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>Cullors, an activist and artist, spoke prominently about the origins of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>\n<p>She discussed how the acquittal of Neighborhood Watch Coordinator George Zimmerman after his killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin caused outrage among those in the black community and beyond.</p>\n<p>“It was a response, it was a guttural response to one of our tragedies of our generation,” Cullors said.</p>\n<p>She condemned Zimmerman’s trial and subsequent acquittal, stating Zimmerman’s defense “[tried] to build a defense that Trayvon Martin deserved to die.”</p>\n<p>Cullors, a native of San Fernando Valley, also spoke about growing up in a community which resented the police and intimately felt the effects of mass incarceration. She highlighted the paradoxes in the American justice system, exemplified by Zimmerman’s not-guilty verdict.</p>\n<p>“I sat with a contradiction of living in a country that has two million people in prison, one million of them black and George Zimmerman, a white-passing Latino, gets to kill a human being and go home free.”</p>\n<p>Fellow activist Alicia Garza’s subsequent coinage of the term “Black Lives Matter” in a Facebook post, and Cullors’ decision to attach a hashtag to it in a post expressing her frustration, led to #BlackLivesMatter becoming a viral phenomenon – and later, a tangible social movement.</p>\n<p>However, Cullors emphasized the continuity of the Black Lives Matter movement with regards to the past.</p>\n<p>“This concept of Black Lives Matter has lineage. It’s a part of the Black Power Movement,” she said. “We stand on the shoulders of giants.”</p>\n<p>Cullors emphasized the importance of becoming involved with issues beyond the confines of social media and fostering relationships with other organizations, such as the Women’s March and the #MeToo movement.</p>\n<p>“Contrary to the media, a hashtag doesn’t start an actual movement. It takes skills, it takes organizing, it takes commitment and it takes sacrifice,” she said.</p>\n<p>For those within the MCC, Cullors’ talk surpassed already-high expectations.</p>\n<p>MCC Program Coordinator Abire Sabbagh expressed relief that Cullors didn’t avoid sensitive topics and instead tackled touchy subjects with grace and eloquence.</p>\n<p>“We’re not going to sugarcoat anything. We’re going to talk about the struggles and we’re going to talk about how hard it is, but we’re also going to talk about what we do and how we build the movement that we need to liberate ourselves,” Sabbagh said.</p>\n<p>Khan-Marcus also admired Cullors’ ability to bring light to the issues by talking about her own personal experiences and how a sense of community and family gave Cullors a refuge from suffering.</p>\n<p>“She talked about all the hardship she went through as a child, but there’s also a sense of love,” Khan-Marcus said. “I’m absolutely thrilled. Her presence itself was incredible.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
