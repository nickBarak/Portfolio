Senate. It seems Solomon has a resolution on the table nearly every week, if not every other week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir drafted three resolutions during her entire term as a senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon cited their primary reason for running is because they genuinely wanted to help students, and because, having been engaged in so many spaces on campus, they understand what students need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon firmly believes in the term “trickle-up social justice,” which they explained as helping the most marginalized, vulnerable people on campus: “the people who have their voices silenced the most.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Solomon’s resume sprawls all over campus – they have worked in Ortega Dining Commons, the Davidson Library, the UCen Bookstore, the A.S. Cashiers and Ticket Office and beyond. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, their most prominent role came in being the A.S. Finance and Business Chair, during which they kept track of nearly $15 million dollars in student fees while also holding an unwavering commitment to transparency through weekly graphics that showed students exactly where student fees go. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon has also reached outside of the senatorial role to organize the Trans Joy Take Over, a survivor solidarity event, and worked hard to promote the A.S. Book Bank in order to help students who may otherwise not be able to afford textbooks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve seen so many aspects of student life, I feel like that makes me very equipped and qualified,” they said in their interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I kept telling students this year, this is your money. A.S. needs to be less of an elitist thing, it takes work from people within it to share with people out of it and people who don’t know very much about it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their proudest moment as senator came when they drafted a resolution supporting the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/chancellor-yang-promises-fulfillment-of-multiple-bsu-demands/\">Black Student Union Demands</a> and were able to see the tangible change being made for Black students on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a senatorial candidate in Spring Quarter 2018, Solomon centered their platform on mental health education, pushing for decreased wait times at Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this goal was not nearly unique at the time, Solomon won the most “first” votes out of any other on-campus senator during the Spring Quarter 2018 elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They have further solidified relationships with UCSB administration, working with Vice Chancellor for Students Affairs Margaret Klawunn to lower the fee waiver for students who have been charged in the College Alcohol and Substance Education (C.A.S.E.) program, as well as supporting former A.S. Advisor LaDonte King’s legacy by creating the “King’s A+ For Excellence”  scholarship in his name. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon said they had to work hard to get that fee lowered. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really had to show them that I’m not just a student who enjoys drinking and wants people to not get charged for that. It’s a serious issue… students were put in really bad financial situations because of the C.A.S.E. fee and sometimes it was just because they were caught with alcohol in a dorm or just very minor things when the real issue is actually binge drinking.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon also has a self-described “working relationship” with the Office of Financial Aid, putting on workshops with them and becoming familiar with the department’s director.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They further spoke to their attendance of conferences, noting they have a “really good network” at UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz. They have learned from those campuses and their student governments with the aim of making UC Santa Barbara’s A.S. better. </span></p>\n<p><b>GOALS IF ELECTED: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It appears Solomon has not forgotten the C.A.P.S. goal that they ran on as a senatorial candidate, as Solomon noted in their interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that, if elected, they want to continue to push for more funding for C.A.P.S., along with a dozen other agenda items, which include: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supporting the Black Student Union Demands;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working to make textbooks more affordable; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating UC-wide coalitions between student activists and student leaders; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pushing the UC President, Janet Napolitano, to make sure students’ voices are heard; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a peer mentor program with the Office of the President, in which students would be more informed about their financial aid and advising options;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing to put out surveys to gauge students’ needs;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expanding the A.S. Book Bank; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a “legitimate” test bank so students can share notes, which Solomon believes will help with retention rates; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating an academic excellence initiative to create part-time jobs through the expansion of the book bank;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a program called Gaucho Career, which is a career development program that would help students get a headstart on a future career;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Redesigning the A.S. website so it is more interactive; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expanding the A.S. fellowship;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working with the Alumni Association to develop a mentorship program that would connect successful alumni and students;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving beyond just the A.S. Senate’s live stream and live streaming meetings with all administration officials to make them more accessible;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a lock-in fee that would support the cost of gender reassignment surgery, creating a grant similar to the ones given out by the Educational Opportunity Program; </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir is running on a platform of making college more affordable by lobbying legislators, introducing an app that would contain a list of all A.S. resources, purchasing a subscription to Headspace – a guided meditation app – for every student using A.S. monies and putting a vending machine in I.V. that would provide free meals to students with financial need and undocumented students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir has been working on the latter project during her “gap year” between senate and her candidacy. </span></p>\n<p><b>OUR CONCERNS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">acknowledges Solomon has a tendency to lean away from impartiality: a few weeks ago, they went as far as to call the other party “Colonizers United” in a tweet on their Twitter page, which was public at the time. We were disappointed when Solomon did not fully respond to our question about the tweet and a question about a judicial council case they were involved in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They did, however, admit that the tweet was a “momentary lapse” in judgement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, Solomon said they would not use their private social media accounts for A.S. and political business. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second point of concern with Solomon’s candidacy – and one that gave the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> pause when discussing endorsements – was the fact that they deceived the student body during Fall Quarter 2018 by not living amongst their constituents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During their interview with the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Solomon admitted to living off campus during Fall Quarter 2018, a possible violation of their term as an on-campus senator – an offense that fellow On-Campus Senator Yasamin Salari was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-26/judicial-council-unanimously-votes-to-remove-a-s-senator-salari/\">removed from her position for</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They spoke candidly about their situation, citing financial struggles as the reason. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the beginning of the year and throughout the summer, I could not afford to live anywhere. So I didn’t have a lease… anywhere fall quarter,” Solomon said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon added that they did tell Internal Vice President Steven Ho about the situation; however, the fact remains that their constituents did not know. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was living with a friend until I could afford to pay for winter and spring [quarters]. And I’m in a pretty bad place financially. I was trying to save up money.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon said the reason they didn’t speak about the issue publicly at the time is because they did not want “the additional burden” that came with the publicity that Salari had experienced. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> acknowledges that Solomon’s deception was troubling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, given Solomon’s ability to be candid and open with us now, combined with the financial hardships that they had faced, we do not believe this should affect the student body’s decision on who to choose as the president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus’ </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">specific concerns, we fully recognize Solomon’s cracks as a candidate are far and few compared to their successes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon has created change in every corner of this campus. Even those not involved in A.S. circles – which are admittedly rather insulated – know Solomon as someone who has accomplished a lot in their short time at UCSB, a fact the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found as we were deciding who to endorse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon is a current second year, and while we realize that having a third-year A.S. president is a bit unorthodox, they appear to be naturally suited for the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are open about their struggles and their qualifications, and aren’t afraid to take on the realities of the job – they noted that their identity as a queer, Black person helps them to understand the struggle of all students, particularly marginalized ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their interview, Solomon put it aptly: “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most marginalized people [on campus] experience all the bugs in a system, like all the things going wrong with the association or the university… We’re able to feel it the most and then we’re able to advocate for them and make this university better in a way that benefits every single student on this campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As echoed before, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">believes that either Solomon or Sir would serve the school well; no matter who takes home a victory on the night of April 25, our school will be in good hands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the fact remains: our choice is Solomon – we have faith in them to not only do the job required if elected, but to also go above and beyond to advocate for UCSB students at every possible level. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Daily Nexus Editorial Board is comprised of the editor in chief and the news team.</span></i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the April 18, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Although Ho did make an effort to keep his Senate under tabs, multiple instances of disorder showcased in Senate meetings were ultimately left unmediated by Ho, who is responsible for being both diplomatic and bipartisan in the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> believes Alli Adam will better equipped to handle unruly situations and facilitate Senate meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, Adam served as a Letters and Sciences senator where she learned that the common goal of A.S. – to help the student body as a whole – often gets lost in “pettiness on the Senate floor.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to run for internal vice president to access the full potential and legitimacy that the Senate could have,” Adam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam plans to crack down on the use of technology during public forum, which is an area that she believes Ho did not spend enough effort to enforce. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam finds the current penalty for technology use, docking honoraria, to be ineffective, noting that most senators breach the policy and use technology anyways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To remediate this problem, Adam plans to have senators “put their phone next to their name tags,” where they will be much more visible to the public, other senators and the IVP. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam proposed this idea because she finds that senators “aren’t as attentive” as they should be, despite the importance of public forum, when “members of our community and our campus come to talk to who they believe is to be representing them and responsive to their needs and responsive to their concerns.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To further uphold a healthy environment at Senate meetings, Adam said she will have “no problem kicking people out of public forum if they are inappropriate… I can’t have my senators feeling like they’re unsafe when somebody’s coming in for public forums.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When questioned about her qualifications for the position, Adam cited her experience in mock trial, public speaking, her work in the office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs, an internship at the Alumni Association  and her work in Senate this past year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Adam’s public forum resolution didn’t “pan out” the way she wanted it to, she stands behind it because it provides students a concrete and guaranteed time to speak at public forum. The resolution was created in order to hold public forum at a set time, before the “new business” section of the Senate agenda. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of her resolution, Adam also provided students with a “campus-wide school supply drive,” where she was “able to save the time and money of over 500 students during Week One.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of personal qualities, Adam said she will take advantage of her assertiveness and confidence to help keep order and set precedent at Senate meetings.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m confident and unafraid to have order in the Senate room because I think the lack of order and the lack of control has let us senators think we can do whatever we want,” Adam said. “We all need to be on the same page and we all need to have a consistent behavior so that we’re cohesive and we’re productive.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, when asked about an instance where she was able to display her assertiveness, Adam was not able to list any tangible examples, citing the “toxic” and “disheartening” atmosphere at Senate meetings where she felt “honest opinions aren’t valued.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a larger scale, the role of IVP requires whoever is filling the seat to remain neutral, unbiased and bipartisan. Adam has run with Campus United, one of the two A.S parties, for both her Senate and executive campaigns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When questioned about her bipartisanship, Adam pledged that, even in the event all other executives are members of the Isla Vista Party, “I am 100% committed to being a neutral and unbiased IVP.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam believes that “drive” and “determination” are much stronger metrics of qualification than party affiliation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam believes working with other executives is “about setting clear goals and clear standards so that we can refer back to them when things do get tricky.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked to critique the current IVP, Adam cited multiple grievances with Ho throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam is chiefly concerned with the timeliness of training, which educates incoming senators on the various parts of A.S. According to Adam, no formal training occurred until Winter Quarter, two quarters after elections concluded. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I kind of felt like our first half of Senate was whether or not you had an in with Steven and you could be his friend enough to get the information,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honoraria, another aspect that Adam holds frustration with, failed to be distributed in a timely manner this year. Honoraria is sometimes used for “basic needs,” according to Adam, when students rely on its timeliness to make payments. To combat this, Adam pledges to ensure that honoraria will be paid on time at the end of each quarter, as well as to post honoraria links so necessary BCUs (Boards, Committees and Units) can receive their funding as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam’s final grievance with Ho’s tenure rests in his oversight of the Senate as a whole. Adam said Ho let senators “run amok” during Senate meetings, which hindered the Senate’s ability to have productive meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho’s poor control of Senate resulted in “a lack of change being made for students,” Adam said, as well as “a lack of legislation because certain senators feel like if they introduce something, it’s going to be like verbally scoffed at.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, Adam is working with another senator, Melissa Perez, to create an alternative method for members of A.S. to interact with students, as she finds that the default settings of Senate meetings are often “toxic” and “intense,” which can deter students from sharing their ideas. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Whether it’s on FaceTime, whether it’s an anonymous email or an anonymous comment, we’re going to have a list that we want to get back out to the students so that they know how they can still contact us if they don’t feel comfortable in the room,” Adam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is also room for improvement in how senators manage BCUs. Adam feels that senators need to do a better job listening to BCUs needs, as it is a senator’s job to be a liaison between their respective BCU and the Senate itself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, Adam suggested that she will ask future senators to “personalize” relationships with their respective BCU, so they can better tune in to each BCU’s specific need.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For me, it comes down to personalizing and, as a senator, how you’re going to work with your BCU,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To maintain transparency within the Senate, Adam proposed the idea of holding one-on-one meetings with each senator every quarter. By doing so, the meetings will allow her to maintain “a clear line of communication” among the entire Senate and help answer any questions senators have by pointing them in the right direction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At every Senate meeting, there is an allocated spot on the agenda for specific on-campus organizations to deliver an update. However, there is almost never a physical presence. Adam plans to “hunt down” these representatives because hearing from them “really helps senators know what those spaces are up to,” as well as “build trust in senators so they can go and collaborate with those people on certain issues.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next year, if elected, Adam would like to have more oversight of Finance and Business, the IVP’s administrative committee and have a Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.)  counselor present at every Senate meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam also expressed her frustration in the lack of resources for students to store their belongings at the end of Spring Quarter. Currently, students can take their belongings home, pay a fee to keep it in a storage locker or move into their new residence two weeks after finals end. Adam would like to create an interim storage solution to allow students to store their belongings as they shift between leases. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Adam would also like to incorporate more funding to “prioritize mental health” without raising student fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Adam has not demonstrated as much tangible change in Senate as the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">would like to see. But we do believe that, coupled with her ideas to improve the role of IVP, her work outside of Senate and her drive to make A.S. a better entity, Adam is an effective, bipartisan and diplomatic candidate for the role of internal vice president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, we believe she has the maturity and confidence to facilitate Wednesday night A.S. Senate meetings effectively. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Daily Nexus Editorial Board is comprised of the editor in chief and the news team. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87552\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alli-adam-for-internal-vice-president/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87552\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alli-adam-for-internal-vice-president/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alli-adam-for-internal-vice-president/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alli-adam-for-internal-vice-president/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alli-adam-for-internal-vice-president/","id":2089,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2088,2087,2086],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Student Advocate General: No Endorsement","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-04-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/andrewn_Max-Abrams_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/andrewn_Max-Abrams_ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Nexus decided not to endorse a candidate for the S.A.G. position.

It has been shortened and lightly edited for clarity:</p>\n<p><strong>What is your name, year and major?</strong><br>\nI am a second year English major and history minor.</p>\n<p><strong>Why are you running for S.A.G.?</strong><br>\nI didn’t anticipate running for an exec position…. I thought that because I served as a senator as an off-campus Senator this year, I would retire after this year, but I figured I still had some gas in the tank and there was still a lot of work left to be done in our community. I figured it would almost be like a sell out move to just retire a little bit earlier than ahead of time.</p>\n<p><strong>What party did you run with as senator? Do you think parties should exist?</strong><br>\nIf you asked me a couple of months ago, I would say [parties] would be completely unnecessary. Now, looking back [on this] year as a whole, I think parties offer some value. I think it’s kept other senators accountable because there is this sense of competitiveness. But as a whole, I think [it has caused] a lot more friction in the organization then it needs to be.</p>\n<p><strong>Because you were involved in Campus United, are you worried that people might not think that you’re independent if you do get the position?</strong><br>\nI’m going to try to brand myself as completely unaffiliated as much as I can. But of course, no matter what you say or how much you do, there’s still people who will cast you one way or another…</p>\n<p>I thrive best in one-on-one situations, on individual scenarios, right. So even in the Senate room, I’ve tried throughout the entire year to cross the aisle per se. I love working with IVP senators. I try to cooperate and collaborate them as much as I can.</p>\n<p><strong>What are you involved with on campus that you believe makes you qualified for S.A.G.?</strong><br>\nI worked for the annual fund and as student ambassadors. So even working with a bunch of those people, you’re talking to all different parts of the campus. Other than that I’m also in the Zeta Psi fraternity. So I’m involved in the Greek community, which constitutes about 10% of our campus. [I am also in] mock trial. I did [mock trial] my freshman year and I still serve as a student coach. And so all of those organizations I think touches on these different corners of our campus. Honestly, I’m just one person and I’d love to be involved as much as I can, but I can’t [be involved in everything].</p>\n<p><strong>You are involved in Greek Life. You will most likely be dealing with a lot of cases and maybe even some against members of Greek Life. Do you feel there’s any sort of conflict of interest here, and what can you do to ease the concerns of the students on campus who don’t feel safe around Greek Life?</strong><br>\nI think my involvement in the Greek Life community actually offered me a really unique perspective. I think I could actually approach those sort of cases with less prejudice because it’s well known that there’s a stigma around a Greek life. Right? And I think that’s where a lot of biases against people that comes about. But having been in Greek life myself, I can see that there are really awesome people in Greek life. I met some of the best people I’ve ever met in my life [in Greek life]. I think [being in Greek life] allows me to approach these sort of cases, along with other communities I’m involved in, in a way that is a more compassionate than someone that isn’t.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most important aspect of being S.A.G.?</strong><br>\nI think making the resources [that are] more accessible. I know a large part of the job is to represent the students interests in terms of disciplinary action. That was definitely a large part of the job. But for me and going into this election season, I really want to emphasize my passion for making a lot of the resources on campus more accessible, [because] at least from my experience, a large part of these resources exist in the first place is because it became clear that a lot of students need things like the Food Bank, but [some students] don’t know that these resources exist.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any specific projects that you’re interested in working on while S.A.G.?</strong><br>\nI was talking to Jack Tannenbaum [Editor’s Note: Tannenbaum was the 2017-2018 S.A.G.] who was working on [a poll project] throughout the entire year. It was to collect data from the student body, especially from people who aren’t involved in A.S. through the outreach.</p>\n<p>I would love to take on that project, but to build upon it. Tabling, going door to door and through basic face interactions to get students actually really thinking about this thing critically. So [I want to] collect that data and then bring it to the Senate and then say, ‘That this is what the student prioritize.’ I think that is the best way to first determine what the students want. And then from there working with my team to figure out how to make those resources more visible. I can’t do this [alone] obviously. But to work with the cabinet, along with the 24 senators that are about to get elected, I think we do some real damage.</p>\n<p><strong>What would you look for in hiring caseworkers, in members of your office? What are some qualities you’d look for?</strong><br>\nThis is arguably thing I thought about most… I’m really looking forward [to working with a team] and my team will have eagerness and a passion for [the office]. I’m looking for people who will approach these cases with a sense of humanity and compassion that I think the OSA requires a level of empathy that I think students deserve. So that’s the thing I’m really looking for, goodhearted people who care, but [also] have this really special level of compassion for others.</p>\n<p><strong>Example: Say there is an incident where someone says that you are not doing your job correctly. How would you respond to that?</strong><br>\nListen to them, for starters. I think from my experience as a senator and [from] my leadership experience in high school, it’s much harder to sit down and listen to what someone has to say to you, especially when it’s not convenient. So that’s the first thing I’d do. I would listen and see where they’re coming from and then work with them to see how we can better.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have experience working with people in the administration? People like Katya Armistead, Margaret Klawunn, etc.?</strong><br>\nNo, I don’t actually. So a lot of this will be new and a lot of it is very daunting. But the team that I’m hoping to create, I am looking for people who were experienced in working with those sorts of figures. So, I mean, a lot of what you just said seemed daunting.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think you’re prepared for this position?</strong><br>\nI mean, I’m here right now. I think so. I’m hopeful more than I am [prepared]. I am frightened, but I am a human being, so a lot of nights I do stay up thinking about it to see if I’m ready. But I think a large part of me, like I said, is really excited, but [there is] that part that is scared. I think I even find value in that.</p>\n<p>I think it means I’m not stupid. I am trying to be really delicate and really critical about the things I say. I understand the gravity of this position.</p>\n<p><strong>How would you uphold that confidentiality?</strong><br>\nI think the major thing is to emphasize [confidentiality] with my case workers because they’re the ones that are also seeing the case. And for me personally, I’ve dealt with confidentiality. Just being a senator, we have to uphold confidentiality with, especially with Title IX reports.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think can be most improved around campus?</strong><br>\nI think the major thing I’m focused on is the visibility and access to resources. [Hearing] from my friends and my constituents as the senator right now, people just don’t know they exist. That would be the thing that would be most improved. Like I said, just highlighting those sort of resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Legal Code states that the S.A.G. is expected to “Educate the student body about student’s rights, University and Associated Students policies, laws, regulations, procedures, and promote awareness of the availability of support and assistance services offered both by the OSA, Associated Students, and the University at large.” How would you go about doing that?</strong><br>\nYeah, so I know workshops are also very good way to go about that. I think a lot of students are interested in the rights that they have. I think once I have been making myself visible and I have a good amount of influence on the community at large, I think pushing these workshops that educate people on their student rights [would] be really helpful.</p>\n<p><strong>Where do you think your personal identity intersects with your professional duty to represent students, especially those of historically underrepresented communities? How do you think your identity will play a role in your position as S.A.G. if elected?</strong><br>\nWell, I’m a second generation American. My parents migrated over to America in 1979 and so growing up, I have definitely been somebody who has experienced and been exposed to a lot of <em>microaggressions.</em> Absolutely. But to say that I have been largely marginalized and I think would be to invalidate the narratives of so many other people. I don’t plan on casting myself as someone by a marginalized narrative, but I do have a sense of what that feels to be a second generation American.</p>\n<p><strong>How would you go about choosing your team?</strong><br>\nSo I would send out an application. An online application that asks what organizations they’re part of. That’s major, that very basic stuff. Right. And then once they come to interview, I kind of have to ask them, um, [a lot of] sorts of questions. Quite honestly, [I want] just to see different personalities in work.</p>\n<p><em>The </em>Daily Nexus<em> Editorial Board is comprised of the editor in chief and the news team</em>.</p>\n<p><i>Correction [11:10 p.m.]: Nguyen said he originally thought A.S. political parties were “unnecessary,” not “necessary.” This article has been updated to reflect that. </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87562\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/student-advocate-general-no-endorsement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87562\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/student-advocate-general-no-endorsement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/student-advocate-general-no-endorsement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/student-advocate-general-no-endorsement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/student-advocate-general-no-endorsement/","id":2088,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2087,2086,2085],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Alexandra Leal Silva for External Vice President for Statewide Affairs","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-04-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/alexandral_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/alexandral_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Nexus endorses Alexandra Leal Silva for the position of EVPSA.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Isla Vista Party candidate Alexandra Leal Silva and Campus United candidate Daevionne Beasley are both confident, charismatic and genuine leaders.

She started off as a fellow her first year, went on to work as the community organizing director and is currently the legislative director in the office.</p>\n<p>She knows the EVPSA office inside out — she knows how to get things done and exactly who to work with to make things happen.</p>\n<p>Leal Silva has spent the last three years working behind the scenes, and it’s time for her to be in the spotlight.</p>\n<p>“I think the EVPSA is a very unique position in which it’s not something that you can just come into and know what you’re doing,” Leal Silva said. “There are so many institutions that you’re navigating, so many relationships that have to be formed. Frankly, they get the work done and I think I’ve really put in the groundwork to allow myself to do that work.”</p>\n<p>“I know what a successful office looks like versus one that needs more work. I have worked in every single office that has existed on this campus for the past three years.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva has ample experience working with Associated Students (A.S.) Lobby Corps; this past year, she has been working on Senate Bill 24, a bill which would ensure abortion by medication access on college campuses.</p>\n<p>Last year, Leal Silva helped create Coffee and Calls, which provided students with the opportunity to call their senators about certain legislation while having a free cup of coffee in the Arbor.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> asked Leal Silva why she decided to stay working behind the scenes for so long, and her answer further confirmed that she is now ready to take on the position.</p>\n<p>“I am a big believer in taking space and leaving space and knowing when to step up and knowing when to take a step back and just do the work,” Leal Silva said. “I’m not ashamed to admit that I wouldn’t have been able to serve our students as well last year.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva made it clear that she will not be affected by any of the drama or toxicity that comes with party politics in A.S.</p>\n<p>“The EVPSA office is such a unique space. It’s one space that, personally, I’ve never seen become enthralled with the drama that sometimes can enthrall A.S.,” she said. “It’s not the sense of superiority or like ‘we’re above it,’ but it’s this sense of knowing… we’re working for something so big, we’re working for ideas that seem so unattainable.”</p>\n<p>“There isn’t time to get caught up in all of it.”</p>\n<p>For the first two years of Leal Silva working in the EVPSA office, the office was “CU-controlled.”</p>\n<p>“For me, it comes down to: Are you down to do the work?” Leal Silva said.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, the boy living on Picasso, the girl living on Sabado… they don’t care about your business. They don’t care about your drama, they just care about how you’re doing work that helps them.”</p>\n<p>If elected, Leal Silva hopes to focus on expanding financial aid and focus specifically on advocating for the Middle Class Scholarship.</p>\n<p>Leal Silva also wants to focus on deferred maintenance funding.</p>\n<p>“We need to talk about how Girvetz is in shambles, but we have brand new bioengineering buildings,” Leal Silva said. “Our students should feel like they all have access to this equal level of education and that they’re not being left behind because of their major.”</p>\n<p>“Newsom asks that we add a thousand more students to the UC system. How could we possibly accommodate for those students if we can’t accommodate for the ones we already have?”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva’s maturity and sense of responsibility are two qualities necessary for the EVPSA position, but more than anything, Leal Silva sold the <em>Nexus</em> on her pure passion for the work she does and the goals she has for UCSB if elected into the position.</p>\n<p>“I want UCSB to be a leader of force when it comes to these issues. I want them to think of our campus as an indispensable area of innovation and of creativity and community. I think that we already have it and I think we can do more of it, and I would love to help lead us to that next step.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva also referenced the Finance and Business Committee budget reports that On-Campus Senator Zion Solomon has been creating, stating she wants to take similar steps in order to be transparent with the amount of money spent on lobbying trips.</p>\n<p>“I’m very aware that the EVPSA has one of the biggest budgets in A.S. because they do work that needs, frankly, more money,” Leal Silva said. “But being intentional and being like ‘just so you know, this is what we’re doing with the [money]’… can really, I think, strengthen that bond of trust between the student body and the office.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“That’s what allyship is… It’s using your privilege to say, ‘I’m going to step aside and give you my stage for however long you need it to get your point across.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In terms of what the EVPSA office has done to increase transparency during the time Leal Silva has worked in it, Leal Silva said she believes the social media presence of the office has grown over the last three years in order to keep students in the loop, and she hopes the office’s social media presence will continue to grow.</p>\n<p>Leal Silva also showed that she knows exactly who to work with within A.S. for the projects she wants to take on.</p>\n<p>She talked about funding to address food insecurity in I.V., and said she would work with the Executive Vice President for Local Affairs and the A.S. Food Bank. She discussed addressing the holes in Title IX policy, and said she would work with C.A.R.E. and Take Back the Night. Leal Silva also mentioned working with the Human Rights Board to advocate for gun violence legislation.</p>\n<p>Leal Silva is also knowledgeable about UCSB’s role in the United States Students Association (USSA) and the University of California Student Association (UCSA).</p>\n<p>“UCSB pays the most dues to the UCSA, which means that when we’re talking about issues, they need to listen to our campus because we’re paying the most money.”</p>\n<p>“I think the money that we do put forth is doing tangible good. It is doing really great things in terms of supporting the undocumented community, in terms of supporting sustainable programs, and in terms of funding the UC,” she added. “As EVPSA, I want to make sure that those benefits are being felt on our campus.”</p>\n<p>This past year, Leal Silva has been serving on the Government Relations Committee of UCSA, which includes the legislative directors of other UCs; Leal Silva has effectively built connections with other UC EVPSA offices already.</p>\n<p>“I’ve learned a lot from listening to how Berkeley runs their office, to San Diego, to Santa Cruz, and they all have such critical ways of approaching these issues,” Leal Silva said. “I almost don’t want to compare them because I don’t want the space to feel like a race or like a competition.</p>\n<p>“It very much so should exist as a collaborative space where you’re learning from each other.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva also seems committed to doing whatever it takes to help marginalized students on campus and added that she wants to continue to advocate for UCSA’s Undocumented Student’s Lobby Day.</p>\n<p>“That’s what allyship is… It’s using your privilege to say, ‘I’m going to step aside and give you my stage for however long you need it to get your point across.’”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva also believes that it wouldn’t be her constituents’ jobs to come to her, but instead, it would be her job to go to them.</p>\n<p>“If you want to know what’s affecting students in the [Muslim Student Association], you have to go to an MSA meeting and sit down and listen. You want to understand what’s affecting students in Indus or MEChA or even CLAS.… go to CLAS and ask the tutors ‘what are you witnessing?’”</p>\n<p>“Go to a C.A.P.S. psychologist [and ask] ‘What services would help you do your job better?’ It’s all very worth it if you want to understand where students are at.”</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> does believe that Beasley is a capable leader. He is the director of internal affairs for the Coalition for a Better UC (CBUC), and he spoke to the work he has done on one of the CBUC’s goals to expand the Cal Grant.</p>\n<p>Beasley has refreshing ideas. He wants to help stop the UC from doing business with corporations that profit off of prison labor and support formerly incarcerated young adults who apply to UCSB, along with his more common platform point of decreasing the burden of tuition for UC students.</p>\n<p>When asked why he decided to run this year, Beasley said, “I figured it was, you know, prime time because I’ll be going into my third year. I don’t want to do it while I’d be studying abroad my senior year.”</p>\n<p>“I figured if I were to run this quarter, then my term would start while we were still doing the hearings for the bill, so I’d be able to use the resources from the office to be able to try to push this bill and push student issues as a whole.”</p>\n<p>While the <em>Nexus</em> admires Beasley’s work on the Summer Cal Grant bill, we are concerned that this one bill will end up being his primary focus.</p>\n<p>“I know that he has done a lot of work regarding Cal Grants and financial aid,” Leal Silva said when asked about her opponent.</p>\n<p>“There is a lot to be considered and it can’t be just that.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva added that she’s had the “privilege of working with him and working with his group on the Cal Grant,” and that she believes he is doing “incredible work.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva said that Beasley is “an example of what student leadership is and of what boots-on-the-ground work is,” and she wants to continue to collaborate with Beasley.</p>\n<p>Leal Silva has the broad knowledge of issues that are required of the EVPSA to know about, and we do not believe that Beasley has the insight or experience that Leal Silva has.</p>\n<p>When Leal Silva was a first year at UCSB, she applied to a lobbying trip and did not get in. Leal Silva spoke to how disappointed she felt, and she mentioned how the legislative director in the EVPSA office at the time told her that she had to make herself “indispensable” on this campus.</p>\n<p>“[He said] ‘you need to be one of the people that if we’re talking about Title IX, or if we’re talking about financial aid, we think of you automatically as someone we need to have on our team.’”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva has done just that — she has become indispensable on this campus.</p>\n<p>“We have so much potential,” Leal Silva said toward the end of her interview. “If chosen to serve, I would give it everything I had and more.”</p>\n<p>We believe her.</p>\n<p><em>The </em>Daily Nexus<em> Editorial Board is comprised of the editor in chief and the news team.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87560\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87560\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/","id":2090,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2089,2088,2087],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
