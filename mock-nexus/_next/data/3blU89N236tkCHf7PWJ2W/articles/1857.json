With Jake Peavy at the front of our rotation and newly-minted hall-of-famer Trevor Hoffman at the back end, our dependable pitching always kept us in games. But despite all of their success, there was never a feeling we were truly competing for a title.</p>\n<p>In reality, we were lucky when we didn’t get swept in the first round of the playoffs – a yearly occurrence for a team that lacked any semblance of a threatening lineup.</p>\n<p>But when I got that notification on my phone in bold letters, “Hosmer decides to sign with Padres,” everything changed.</p>\n<p>San Diego has never, in my entire lifetime, signed an all-star in the midst of his prime – that is, until now. Hosmer is only 28 and is coming off a career season in which he hit .318 with 25 homers at the plate.</p>\n<p>Two seasons ago, this man was named the All-Star Game MVP at Petco Park, proving that perhaps he can overcome the mental mistakes of hitters in the past and actually have success hitting at Petco. As a lefty, those odds are even more likely.</p>\n<p>The city needed this. It was about a year ago that Dean Spanos screwed over an entire city of loyal fans by moving the Chargers.</p>\n<p>San Diego State Basketball hasn’t been up to par since Steve Fisher retired – even before that, if we’re being honest.</p>\n<p>We need a team to get behind, to energize the fan base, to get “America’s Finest City” excited about something again.</p>\n<p>I’m not quixotic enough to really believe that signing Hosmer will automatically catapult us into the title conversation; in fact, I’m not even sure it makes us a playoff team this year. Putting Hosmer at first pushes Wil Myers to the outfield, a position that he once said he “gets bored playing.” Myers gladly signed on to the move, but by no means is he a Gold Glover out there.<br>\nIn addition, our rotation is still a mess, to put it mildly.</p>\n<p>Half of our rotation is probably closer to being in a retirement home than an adequate major league starter. I mean, Chris Young was a good starter for the Padres … in 2006. If Kemp was the old iPhone model, then Young is an iPod Touch Generation Two. With that being said, it supports my notion that the Padres lack an ideal major league rotation.</p>\n<p>Pundits have been all too kind in pointing this out, questioning the fit and the Padres decision to dole out over $140 million to a player who has been inconsistent at times throughout his career.</p>\n<p>But Hosmer has two things that his stats can’t account for: leadership and experience.</p>\n<p>He’s been to the World Series with the Royals. According to Ken Rosenthal, reviews have been “glowing” on Hosmer’s clubhouse presence. He can provide invaluable insight for a young rebuilding roster that boasts one of the best farm systems in the majors.</p>\n<p>And because of his age, he still fits in the Padres’ long-term plans. The goal the entire time was to “compete” in 2019; at that point, Hosmer will still only be 29.</p>\n<p>Plus, the deal is front-loaded to allow the Padres to get rid of him after five years with a much lesser salary hit.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, we have a reason to celebrate, to see the clear vision of the front office and to applaud them for finally being willing to spend money. We have a reason to cheer again.</p>\n<p>Just like every year in the recent past, I’ll be attending opening day with my dad. This time, however, I will do so with renewed hope. This time, I will do so with the belief that we are on the cusp of finally bringing a title back to the city I hold so dear.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Feb. 22</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

while she was asleep. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They hear about everything before I do, and they’re freaking out for me, and I’m trying to calm them down from another continent,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For some students and their families, the stress of not knowing when — not if, when — the program would be canceled was too much to bear. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of my friends, her dad was freaking out and she’s going home tomorrow morning,” she said. “He called her yesterday and was like ‘I can’t handle this anymore, I don’t even know if your program’s gonna get cancelled but I’m buying you a ticket to come home.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that the programs have officially been canceled, UCEAP has been working with both the host universities abroad and the students’ home UC campuses to coordinate course credit, financial aid and all the other lingering questions that remain for these students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel said she was told by her study abroad advisor that UCEAP was attempting to convert the study abroad courses to online courses, so students could finish their semesters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But that sounds so impossible to me,” she said, while acknowledging that it would be her best option.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once she received the official cancelation email from UCEAP, Pimentel said she would probably book her flight home for late next week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t imagine having to crash courses if we can’t even be on campus until the end of April,” she said. “I don’t know how I would go about getting myself into classes. I also don’t know how I would handle housing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, Pimentel is focusing on enjoying her last few days abroad. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know, I just don’t want to come home. It’s two months early, and it’s really disappointing and really sad, but I just keep trying to remind myself that it could be worse,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><em>Updated: [3/19/20 3:45 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated: [3/17/20 3:02 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated: [3/16/20 11:30 a.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated: [3/14/20 2:12 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The I.V.

CSD is currently in communication with UCSB, Santa Barbara City College, the County of Santa Barbara and public health officials to determine the new date for the community festival.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The now-defunct festival would have shared similar features to a carnival; the event would have included a rock wall, a water balloon toss, face-painting, local bands and free food provided by various I.V. businesses, according to Armistead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been directed on our campus not to host any events. In fact, most of everything’s canceled in April,” Armistead said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is unknown how UCSB’s decision will affect the annual Deltopia, an unsanctioned street party planned for April 4.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The thing is about Deltopia proper, the unsanctioned events, it’s really up to those who live in Isla Vista to decide when they want to do with [Deltopia]. So we’re going to keep eyes on it in terms of making sure our community is safe,” Armistead added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said that despite the delays, the planning for the festival did serve to lay the foundation for a festival in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is a silver lining here,” Brandt explained. “We’ve done, essentially, all the legwork that we needed to get to a point where the community festival will become a reality and where we will be able to transition folks into an alternative event that is fun, that is safe and changes the vibe of what’s going on during Deltopia weekend in a significant way for the better.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
