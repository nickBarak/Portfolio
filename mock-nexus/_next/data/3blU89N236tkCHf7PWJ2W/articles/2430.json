While the two DJs often play music from foreign countries, this Tuesday’s show focused on Muslim rappers in particular.</p>\n<p>KCSB FM is the “perfect platform” for a show dedicated to resistance through the arts, Horne said.</p>\n<p>“Our whole ethos as a station is community radio representing sounds, music, opinions and values that you are not going to hear on commercial radio or in any other forms of media today,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Horne, hip-hop has been a symbol of dissent, revolution and change, as well as subverting what is expected from communities that have been brutalized by the dominant cultures.</p>\n<p>The two KCSB DJs chose music that tackles political unrest.</p>\n<p>The “Fire + Ice” hosts featured Libyan rapper Volcano’s single “Sawt Al Shaab,” and said his music video depicts the rapper singing in front of firing tanks while wearing golden chains and camouflage-patterned, oversized hoodies.</p>\n<p>Horne and Bernick, who goes by “DJ LenaBanga,” said “gangster imagery” is co-opted in the music video, modeled after the Western hip-hop scene.</p>\n<p>The DJs said the use of camouflage in the music video takes on a new meaning when placed in the context of a Middle East war zone.</p>\n<p>“The video, he shot it in a war zone in Benghazi. What’s really interesting going on in this video is a co-opting of gangster rap imagery. So, Volcano, he’s decked out in oversized hoodies, baggy camo pants, got the guns blaring, chain heavy,” Horne said.</p>\n<p>“The camo and the guns take on another meaning, but … we can apply that back to the origins of gangster rap here in the U.S. in the war zones that exist within our own cities,” he said.</p>\n<p>“He’s in a war zone, and these things are also very real,” Bernick said.</p>\n<p>Tuesday’s radio show primarily played songs in foreign languages, such as Arabic and Farsi.</p>\n<p>The DJs chose Tuesday night’s artists because they have considerable followings in the countries they come from, though they recognize that certain regions lack large hip-hop fan bases.</p>\n<p>“Iran has a pretty large hip-hop scene compared to some places like Yemen or Libya,” Horne said.</p>\n<p>Bernick and Horne also said the artists’ skepticism toward government was similar to the duo’s own.</p>\n<p>“We think a healthy dose of criticism and skepticism towards the state is really, really necessary for us to keep going with a sense of freedom that resembles what we know it to be,” Horne said.</p>\n<p>DJ Frank Discussion and DJ LenaBanga’s show can be heard on KCSB FM 91.9, or streamed live on <em>live.kcsb.org</em>, on Tuesday nights from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, February 2, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75408\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/kcsb-djs-spin-music-from-banned-countries/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75408\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/kcsb-djs-spin-music-from-banned-countries/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/kcsb-djs-spin-music-from-banned-countries/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/kcsb-djs-spin-music-from-banned-countries/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/kcsb-djs-spin-music-from-banned-countries/","id":2430,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2429,2428,2427],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[2286,2364,2385,2391,2392,2400,2404,2416,2419,2421,2424,2425,2429,2430,2443,3574,3584,3601,3737,3749,3756,3757,3763,3786,3801,3806,3908,3910,3920,3925,3926,3952,4280,4291,4313,4352,4357,4386,4387,4388,4389,4392,4393,4394,4395,4403,4404,4406,4408,4409,4423,4426,4435,4442,4449,4465,4489,7780],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Travel Ban Bars 3 Students From U.S. Return","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/immigration1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/immigration1.jpg?resize=720%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In a press release Saturday, the UC Office of the President advised students from the seven countries listed in the executive order to not travel outside the United States.

One of these students is an undergraduate from Syria, two are undergraduates from Iran and the remaining 37 are graduate students from Iran.</p>\n<p>According to Janet Afary, a professor of Iranian studies, there is “a great deal of anxiety” among graduate students at UCSB who cannot return to Iran in fear that their visas may not be renewed.</p>\n<p>Leila Zonouzi, an Iranian student pursuing a Ph.D. in global studies, planned to wed her fiance this summer. She said her parents and in-laws are in Iran, but since the executive order halted immigration from that country, they are unable to fly to the U.S. for the wedding.</p>\n<p>“I won’t be able to get married because, well, let’s face it, without our parents, who are we celebrating with?” she said.</p>\n<p>Zonouzi said the travel ban also affects visas for her fiancé’s job and her academic career. Her fiancé, who is also Iranian with a visa expiring in a year, may not apply for an H-1 visa or a green card “if this continues.” Zonouzi has a two-year visa expiring in June 2018 while enrolled in a five- to seven-year program.</p>\n<p>“With this rate of madness, I’m not actually sure I can extend it and be a Ph.D. candidate,” Zonouzi said.</p>\n<p>Another UCSB student affected by the travel ban is Mahdi Golkaram, an Iranian mechanical engineering Ph.D. student who said he won’t be able to see his parents for years. His parents received their visas two weeks ago after applying at the U.S. embassy and undergoing a background check for nine months.</p>\n<p>“Because of the executive order, they can’t come to the United States because anyone from Iran is banned from entering the United States using any passport visa,” Golkaram said.</p>\n<p>The ban has also affected Golkaram’s job opportunities. He said he doesn’t know if he can apply for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) required for his internship placement this fall since the ban limits requests going through to the USCIS for Iranian people.</p>\n<p>“A lot of companies that I have job offers for right now are contacting me and asking if I know what my visa and resident situation is going to be,” he said. “Even if the companies are fine with me, they will be anxious about whether or not I can accept the job offer.”</p>\n<p>A Reddit user, posting as an Iranian-Canadian UCSB student on Saturday, said he or she was “sent back in Germany” while trying to reenter the U.S. after a trip to Tehran, Iran.</p>\n<p>The Nexus confirmed that Yousefian Jazi and Rasekh did not post on Reddit. The Nexus has sent the Reddit user a private message each day since Saturday, but the user has not yet replied.</p>\n<p>Kraig Rice, an immigration attorney with Juris Doctor California, said Iranian-Canadians would have been denied entry into the U.S on Friday and Saturday. The Trump administration announced Sunday that it would begin to allow entry to Canadian dual citizens.</p>\n<p>The order originally barred all permanent residents and all visas except foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations and G-1, G-2, G-3 and G-4 visas.</p>\n<p>United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) began allowing entry to green card holders on Sunday. Those with student visas, however, are still prohibited from entering the country, according to Abbe Kingston, an immigration attorney based in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“The craziness is there are already people who have been vetted, have already been interviewed, some on airplanes,” Kingston said. “That’s the hysteria it’s created. No one really thought this plan through.”</p>\n<p>In a press release Saturday, the UC Office of the President advised students from the seven countries listed in the executive order to not travel outside the United States. OISS recommends that all international students avoid travel outside the U.S.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, February 2, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75414\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/travel-ban-bars-3-students-from-u-s-return/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75414\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/travel-ban-bars-3-students-from-u-s-return/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/travel-ban-bars-3-students-from-u-s-return/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/travel-ban-bars-3-students-from-u-s-return/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/travel-ban-bars-3-students-from-u-s-return/","id":2427,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2426,2425,2424],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Muslim Students Push Back Against Immigration Ban","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Muslim-Ban-by-Megan-Mineiro-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Muslim-Ban-by-Megan-Mineiro-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"An executive order barring travel from six countries prompted over 200 people to protest at UC Santa Barbara Monday, echoing voices that spoke out nationally against the new presidency.

presidency.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">signed an order Friday to ban travel from Muslim-majority countries Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia for 90 days. </span></p>\n<p>As reports of detainees began to surface at airports throughout the country, Naia Al-Anbar, a Muslim woman and third-year anthropology student, began organizing a protest
