","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>At first blush, San Diego Christian doesn’t seem like too much of a test for the UCSB men’s basketball team. After all, the Hawks are an NAIA team, with a 2-6 record and a handful of losses to teams much worse than the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>When the Hawks entered the Thunderdome on Tuesday night, however, they found a UCSB team in a potentially dangerous situation. With the Gauchos only two days removed from a tough, streak-snapping loss to a high-profile USC team, Tuesday’s game was a serious test of UCSB’s mental ability to bounce back from defeat.</p>\n<p>Within the first ten minutes, it was clear that the Gauchos were bound to pass with flying colors. UCSB jumped out to a 30-12 lead by the 10:00 mark of the first half, and coasted to an 87-69 win.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Despite playing only 21 minutes, sophomore guard Max Heidegger led all Gaucho scorers with 19 points on 8-for-12 shooting, and knocked down a team-high three three’s. Forwards Jalen Canty (12 points and six rebounds) and Leland King II (11 points and seven rebounds) broke the Hawks down from the inside in similarly limited minutes.</p>\n<p>For about four minutes, it seemed as though UCSB had fallen into the trap of overlooking San Diego Christian. The Hawks stayed level with the Gauchos, even taking a 10-8 lead on a pair of Derek Novsek free throws.</p>\n<p>Two more Novsek free throws got the Hawks to 12 points, but those free throws came four minutes later, at the 12:13 mark. In the interim, UCSB had jetted off on an 18-0 run to claim a lead they would never relinquish.</p>\n<p>Heidegger’s 19 first-half points were key to UCSB’s performance in the first twenty minutes, as the sophomore was twelve points ahead of any other scorer on the floor in the half. Senior guard Gabe Vincent was a strong second option with eight points and three assists in his 13 minutes of first-half action.</p>\n<p>The margin stayed about the same from that point until halftime, which the Gauchos went into holding a 50-33 lead. Immediately upon returning from the intermission, however, UCSB broke the game well and truly open.</p>\n<p>Playing with primarily second-unit players, the Gauchos extended their lead to 77-44 by about the ten-minute mark. Forward Ami Lakoju was particularly instrumental in UCSB’s second-half dominance, as the junior chipped in 12 points, tied for his career-high, and five rebounds in just 14 minutes of action.</p>\n<p>Freshman guard Brandon Davis saw an extra-heavy dose of playing time thanks to the blowout as well as a night off for point guard Marcus Jackson, and Davis responded with a career-high nine points on 4-for-6 shooting.</p>\n<p>A 33-point lead with less than ten minutes to go is more or less an unbridgeable chasm of a lead, but the Hawks did their absolute best to string that bridge together. San Diego Christian closed the game on a 23-6 run to bring the deficit back under 20, but was ultimately unable to truly threaten UCSB’s cushion.</p>\n<p>San Diego’s Novsek and Frederick Hayden led all scorers with 21 and 22 points, respectively. Both players scored ten points in the second half alone, providing the dual scoring threats the Hawks needed to claw back within 20 points of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UCSB travels north to take on Sacramento State on Saturday in Sacramento at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Jumping out to an early lead, redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter and freshman guard Denae Miller each scored a basket from downtown.</p>\n<p>Junior combo guard/forward Cheyanne Wallace scored a strong 5 points in the first for the home team.</p>\n<p>After the initial five-point blast, UCSB’s scoring began to falter, being held to just six points for the remainder of the period.</p>\n<p>The quarter then began to get away from the visitors, when the Lions ended the quarter on a 5-0 run, ending the period with a 16-11 lead.</p>\n<p>Trailing by five for the majority of the second quarter, the LMU started to forcefully pull away. With no three-point efforts in the first period, the Lions ignited in the second going 4-for-4 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>One triple was scored by junior guard Andee Velasco, with the other three being secured by senior guard Makenzie Cast.</p>\n<p>With the home team pulling away, Porter hit a three-pointer just before the half ended, bringing UCSB’s deficit to a more manageable 34-26, going into halftime.</p>\n<p>Going bucket-for-bucket with the Lions in the third period, prevented the visitors from gaining any headway against their opponents.</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman for UCSB and Cheyanne Wallace for the home-team, were each heavily engaged in the third.</p>\n<p>Edelman had another stellar double-digit performance, notching eight of her game-high 21 points in the third quarter. While Wallace contributed nine of her team-high 16 points in the third period for LMU.</p>\n<p>The fourth quarter got interesting, as Santa Barbara began to close the gap, bringing the score within four.</p>\n<p>However, after the visiting team’s spark in the fourth, things suddenly changed with just under four minutes to play.</p>\n<p>The score was 62-58 with 3:58 left in regulation, when both teams began to fall short. Both UCSB and the Lions went a combined 0-for-10 from the field for the remainder of the period.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s defense was lacking, allowing Loyola Marymount to outscore them in 3 of the 4 quarters. However, they had a big fourth period, scoring 17 points over the Lions’ 14.</p>\n<p>UCSB shot 36 percent from the field on 23-for-64 shooting, which lacked in comparison to LMU who shot 43 percent on 21-for-49 shooting.</p>\n<p>Edelman’s game-high 21 points gave Santa Barbara a much-needed offensive spike, along with Porter’s 17 points which consisted of four downtown baskets.</p>\n<p>The Lions had an astonishing four players who scored double digits; Makenzie Cast and redshirt junior Bree Alford gave the team 11, Andee Velasco drained 15, and Cheyanne Wallace had a dominant double-double, recording 16 points and 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>The home team conquered the battle of the boards, out rebounding the Gauchos 43-31.</p>\n<p>Beyond the arc was another defeat for UCSB, as they shot a total of 33 three-pointers, and only capitalized on eight of them, ending the night on 24.2 percent three-point shooting. Whereas LMU was more selective about their three-point shots, going for 12, and scoring on 5 of them – to complete 41 percent three-point shooting on the night.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will have another shot to end their losing skid, as they welcome the Aztecs at home this week.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face San Diego State (6-4) on Friday, December 22<sup>nd</sup> at the Thunderdome at 7pm.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80295\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-19/ucsb-drops-9th-straight-match-loses-67-61-at-lmu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80295\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-19/ucsb-drops-9th-straight-match-loses-67-61-at-lmu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-19/ucsb-drops-9th-straight-match-loses-67-61-at-lmu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-19/ucsb-drops-9th-straight-match-loses-67-61-at-lmu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-19/ucsb-drops-9th-straight-match-loses-67-61-at-lmu/","id":204,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[203,202,201],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Amidst 7-Game Slide, Gauchos Look to Get Back on Track vs. LMU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-12-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web-e1580359314548.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web-e1580359314548.jpg?resize=900%2C596&ssl=1","description":"The non-conference portion of its schedule has been a rocky start thus far as the UCSB women's basketball team is 1-7 and will look to earn its first home win of the season when it host Loyola Marymou...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_80012\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"494238659\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80073\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80012\" data-attachment-id=\"80012\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/amidst-7-game-slide-gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-vs-lmu/danae-miller-moves-the-ball-up-the-court-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web-e1580359314548.jpg?fit=900%2C596&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"900,596\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Danae Miller moves the ball up the court.

With their loss to USC, the Lions are polar opposite to the Gauchos, sitting at 7-1.</p>\n<p>Despite their 1-7 start, the Gauchos have found success when they run their offense as envisioned by Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson.</p>\n<p>Henrickson has aimed to orchestrate her team’s offense so that the ball moves through their star in the post, senior forward Drew Edelman. Edelman, while battling a few instances of injuries this year, is averaging team-highs in both points (14.4) and rebounds (8.3) per game.</p>\n<p>However, it seems Edelman is hoping to work her way back to the form she displayed last season when she led the Big West in field-goal percentage (61.4).</p>\n<p>Recently emerging to help Edelman in the scoring department has been redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter. Porter is averaging 10 points, 4.1 rebounds and two assists per game on the season.</p>\n<p>She has been living and dying by the three-ball this season, making 10 shots from beyond the arc in the team’s last three contests.</p>\n<p>However, she started the season only making threes in the first six games.</p>\n<p>Overall, Porter is shooting 30 percent from downtown and will hopefully start finding the net on a more consistent basis.</p>\n<p>In fact in her last three games, she has already shown to be more consistent, knocking down 10 of 25 deep balls.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos have also shown glimpses of hot shooting, they should perhaps avoid getting into a high-scoring contest with LMU.</p>\n<p>UCSB this season is averaging 62.8 ppg, about 14 points less a game than the Lions who average nearly 76 points per contest.</p>\n<p>Contributing to its strong offensive presence were valuable performances made by a few talented players.</p>\n<p>Standing out for the Lions is junior Cheyanne Wallace, who is averaging a team-high 19.5 points along with grabbing 7.8 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Wallace was named the West Coast Conference Player of the Week on Nov. 27.</p>\n<p>Standing at 6’0” in a guard/forward position, Wallace posted 26 ppg and a little over eight boards per game during the week in which she earned the WCC honor.<br>\nShe will certainly be on the Santa Barbara coaching staff’s radar this week, as it will attempt to slow down one of LMU’s best offensive weapons.</p>\n<p>The difficulty for the Gauchos is that LMU has accompanying scoring options to supplement Wallace.</p>\n<p>The Lions have also been getting strong contributions from guard Gabby Green. The 6’2” redshirt junior is in the midst of her debut season at LMU, as she transferred from Berkeley after playing for the Golden Bears for two years.</p>\n<p>In her first year as a Lion, Green has been putting up well-rounded stat lines.</p>\n<p>Green is averaging 15.9 points to go with 6.4 boards and nearly four assists per game.</p>\n<p>Also, Green has so far blocked 10 shots and recorded 21 steals.</p>\n<p>The closest other Lion to these kinds of numbers is none other than Wallace, who has six blocks and 11 steals on the year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will surely have their hands full Thursday night trying to contain LMU’s stars, but UCSB knows it has players who can find the net too such as Edelman and Porter.</p>\n<p>In last year’s meeting between Santa Barbara and the Lions, LMU took the close victory over the Gauchos by just two points, 57-55.</p>\n<p>The year before that loss, the Gauchos also came up short against LMU, so it is likely they will look to redeem themselves.</p>\n<p>Thursday night’s action will tip off at 7 p.m. against Loyola Marymount at the Thunderdome where the Gauchos will look to end their seven-game losing streak and earn their first home win.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Dec. 7, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80073\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/amidst-7-game-slide-gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-vs-lmu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80073\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/amidst-7-game-slide-gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-vs-lmu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/amidst-7-game-slide-gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-vs-lmu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/amidst-7-game-slide-gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-vs-lmu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/amidst-7-game-slide-gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-vs-lmu/","id":203,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[202,201,200],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Struggles Continue Following Blowout Loss at No. 17 Oregon State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-12-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017.11.04_StephenManga_WBasketball-12-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In the second game of a three-match road trip, the Gauchos struggles continue as they have now dropped eight straight after 74-49 loss against the Beavers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As the Thomas Fire continues to rear its ugly head in the Santa Barbara area, the woes of regular season play are all too familiar for the UCSB Women’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>With their 74-49 Saturday night loss to Oregon State at the Moda Center, the Gauchos extend their losing streak to eight games.

The Beavers are ranked 17th in the nation and will look to continue their strong regular season before starting competitive Pac-12 conference play.</p>\n<p>Saturday night’s game was held at the Moda Center in Portland, the home to the NBA’s Portland Trailblazers, for the Dam City Classic in which both the Men’s and Women’s OSU basketball teams compete.</p>\n<p>The game between UCSB and OSU started with a three-pointer made by freshman guard Danae Miller, giving Santa Barbara the early 3-0 lead. The Beavers responded with a trio of unanswered layups to take the 6-3 lead with 7:18 remaining in the first quarter of play.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the Gauchos, their early 3-0 lead would be their sole lead of the night. The low-scoring quarter was rounded out by a pair of buckets by Miller and senior forward Drew Edelman, while the Beavers used a well-rounded scoring effort to lead 14-7 heading into the second quarter.</p>\n<p>UCSB struggled shooting the ball to start the game, notching a sub-par shooting percentage of 15 percent from the floor and an even worse 12 percent from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>In the second quarter, Santa Barbara managed to score 11 points, all from Edelman and redshirt sophomore Tal Sahar.</p>\n<p>Edelman finished the game with 10 points and 4 rebounds, while Sahar led the Gauchos with a season-high 11 points and 7 boards despite shooting 5-17 from the field and going 1-9 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Edelman and Sahar were the lone Gauchos to score in double figures. Oregon State heated up in the second, exploding for 27 points to build a 41-18 lead at the half. Another diversified scoring effort for OSU saw seven Beavers score, led by an 8-point quarter for Kat Tudor.</p>\n<p>Tudor was one of four Beavers to score in double figures on the night, posting 14 points for her team. Center Marie Gulich added 6 in the quarter as part of her 10-point night to go along with 6 boards.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara regrouped during halftime and was able to put together a 19-point third quarter effort. Sarah Porter, a redshirt junior, scored all of her 6 points in the third.</p>\n<p>Two made jumpers by Sahar and then a Sarah Porter three-ball got things rolling for the Gauchos and cut the Beaver lead to 18; however, OSU maintained its composure to keep Santa Barbara at bay.</p>\n<p>OSU guard Aleah Goodman scored 8 of her game-high 17 points in the quarter and the Beavers shot 60 percent from three to subdue Santa Barbara’s brief attempts at making runs. The quarter ended with the Beavers up 62-37 and hopes of a UCSB comeback minimal.</p>\n<p>The fourth quarter saw both teams score 12 points, despite much of those baskets falling during garbage time. With the sound of the final buzzer, OSU held on to beat Santa Barbara 74-49.</p>\n<p>On the night, UCSB held its own in the paint, tying the Beavers for 26 points in the paint and only being outrebounded 34-33.</p>\n<p>An issue for the Gauchos was perhaps their poor shooting effort, going only 22-66 from the field, but also the fact that they failed to reach the free throw line.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara committed 19 personal fouls, OSU was only called for 3 fouls. The Beavers shot 52.9 percent overall and 56.3 percent from three-point territory in an efficient night finding the net.</p>\n<p>Despite the loss to the Beavers, the Gauchos will turn around to face Loyola Marymount at LMU on Monday.</p>\n<p>The game, which was rescheduled from its original date of December 7th due to conditions created by the Thomas Fire, will tip off at 7:00pm.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will look to get their second win of the season against a talented LMU team and use their experiences against top-25 teams in moving forward.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80296\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-17/gauchos-struggles-continue-following-blowout-loss-at-no-17-oregon-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80296\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-17/gauchos-struggles-continue-following-blowout-loss-at-no-17-oregon-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-17/gauchos-struggles-continue-following-blowout-loss-at-no-17-oregon-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-17/gauchos-struggles-continue-following-blowout-loss-at-no-17-oregon-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-17/gauchos-struggles-continue-following-blowout-loss-at-no-17-oregon-state/","id":202,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[201,200,199],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
