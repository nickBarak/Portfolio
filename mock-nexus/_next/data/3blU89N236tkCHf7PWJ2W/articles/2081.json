The line 28 adjustments were drafted by Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (SBMTD) and UC Santa Barbara and are scheduled to come into effect on Aug. 19.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding another bus to line 28 will allow buses to pass by every 10 minutes instead of the current 15-minute intervals, according to Hillary Blackerby, interim planning and marketing manager for SBMTD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Line 28 was established in August 2016 as part of <a href=\"https://www.facilities.ucsb.edu/departments/campus-planning-design/2010-long-range-development-plan-lrdp\">UCSB’s Long Range Development Plan (LRDP)</a>. The plan details campus development up to 2025 through changes in programs, transportation and housing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB funds the operation of the shuttle. The quarterly lock-in student fee of $13.13 is based on enrollment in UCSB and allows students to ride the bus for free.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackerby approached the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) at its April 23 meeting as part of SBMTD’s annual April outreach to inform the board of the proposed bus route changes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackerby noted buses are often filled to capacity along El Colegio Road due to the high amount of students headed toward campus. Many of these students are what she describes as “line-neutral.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You don’t care which [bus] you get on because you know whichever one you get on, it’s going to wind up at campus,” Blackerby said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When people are really just trying to get to campus, they’re filling up lines that have destinations past campus, like downtown.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buses headed toward campus are filled to capacity and exclude people farther down El Colegio as a consequence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 60-foot segmented buses with a standing load of 110 people were originally purchased for line 15x, but instead became used for line 28 due to higher demand. Even now, these buses are still reaching capacity and leaving people behind, according to Blackerby.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She hopes the additional line 28 bus will relieve the overcrowding problems on other El Colegio buses, such as lines 7, 11 and 24x.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Following his first year, he said he  “began to continue to fall in love with our community and work closely with the I.V. CRC, the Teen Center and Community Services District.” Furthermore, Griffin also worked to help students who were displaced by </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cliff collapses on Del Playa Drive</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin also owns his own aerial photography company where he takes pictures for “landlords and property management services.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas, a current off-campus senator, stated he is already working closely with the EVPLA office and is close friends with the current EVPLA, Jeike Meijer. Through his connections with the EVPLA and the office, Ornelas said “[Meijer is] constantly helping me learn more about her office and just the kind of work [that the] EVPLA should be doing, and how the EVPLA can be responsive to community needs.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas placed a heavy emphasis on representing the diversity of the I.V. community, as “we are representing a diverse amount of people, both students and non-students… so it’s really important that you’re able to connect with different communities because we all share Isla Vista and it’s really pertinent to make sure that their voices are uplifted.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One question posed by Elections Board referenced Wi-Fi in I.V. Parks; despite previous efforts, the implementation of free Wi-Fi in the parks has yet to see any tangible progress. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas provided two possible solutions: build routers into park benches or take advantage of “innovative companies that utilize satellites to ping Wi-Fi to certain areas.” However, Ornelas does not guarantee he will be able to make either of these undertakings happen, noting that the term length is not favorable to larger projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin, on the other hand, believes this may be a better job for the I.V. CSD, where he has already established “creative relationships” with some of the directors, such as Father Jon Hedges. Griffin finds that the I.V. CSD would be a more appropriate place to take on the project because they have the “space for transition projects” which can be implemented over the “course of a few years,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both candidates are familiar with the I.V. CSD, the local government representing I.V. But Griffin has worked closely with current I.V. CSD directors Ethan Bertrand and Spencer Brandt in the past; Ornelas admitted that he hasn’t “been super involved in their [I.V. CSD] meetings,” but plans to be more involved in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As brought up by the Elections Board, community outreach is a cornerstone of the EVPLA position, as it is imperative to take into account the diversity of I.V. while also acting as a liaison between the community and the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas, who speaks fluent Spanish, stressed the importance of having a diverse office and proposed the idea of creating a community outreach team to better connect with the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community outreach has a different meaning to Griffin, who has spent the past two years curating a series of interviews with long-term residents of I.V. called “The People of Isla Vista.” Griffin plans to continue this work, if elected, so he can devise a way to produce more inclusive programs that stretch out to those not necessarily affiliated with the school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Street lighting, a contentious issue that seems to never be completely remediated, is seen as a problem by both Ornelas and Griffin, although their solutions are not the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having had worked with the EVPLA office in the past, Griffin sees street lighting as a project for the I.V. CSD – one in which the EVPLA can help supplement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My plan would be to work with them [I.V. CSD]… to go out and find where more lights need to be implemented. And then working with the county and other organizations come up with a concrete plan to install lights in areas that are not fairly lit,” Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas, on the other hand, is a fan of the ongoing efforts of the EVPLA office and its recent release of a street lighting expansion </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/evpla-publishes-proposal-for-lighting-expansion-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Ornelas believes the work should remain in the office to avoid “reinventing the wheel” and restarting the project somewhere else. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas also plans to collaborate with county supervisor Joan Hartmann to “represent our voices at the county level.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an increase in attendance but a decrease in arrests, the elections board asked if it may be possible to remove Deltopia’s festival ordinance in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both candidates agree that instead of abandoning the ordinance entirely, it should be adjusted and scaled down accordingly. Furthermore, Ornelas is weary that if Deltopia becomes a sanctioned, “actual event,” there is the possible repercussion that visitors from other colleges might see the change as a potential advertisement to draw attendance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin is opposed to advertising Deltopia as a real event as well, fearing that it will draw crowds from other schools who see it as an “exclusive event.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elections Board also asked if the candidates believe the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/alcohol-drug-program-evpla-and-gauchos-for-recovery-host-naloxone-trainings/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">community naloxone trainings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> implemented in I.V. have been successful in helping residents learn how to use naloxone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both candidates are in favor of seeing the program expand more. Ornelas, who has attended a training, plans to push for Community Service Officers (CSOs) to also have naloxone on hand, as they currently do not. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about their plans to fight against sexual assault, Griffin and Ornelas proposed different approaches to the situation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas believes the best approach is to listen to the needs of the community. He also cited “really close relationships with folks in students against sexual assault” and the fact that Standing Together To End Sexual Assault (STESA), a college advocate program for sexual assault survivors, recently approached the I.V CSD for funding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin plans to work directly with the I.V. CSD to implement more Green Dot trainings, which help educate students on sexual assault and violence. On top of that, Griffin also hopes to bring the Blue Light system to I.V., which he believes will make the community feel safer at night and speed up police response times by having numerous emergency alarms around I.V. that will alert police if activated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last on the list of questions was the subject of food insecurity and its disproportionate effect on marginalized students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas placed a heavy emphasis on strengthening the services of the A.S. Food Bank and CalFresh. As a vice chair on A.S. Finance and Business, Orneals stated that “there’s honestly a lot of room for improvement in how money can be used more efficiently. So really making sure that we’re reevaluating the budget and allocating that to programs that people really need.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin is in favor of expanding the services of the A.S. Food Bank because he feels “not everybody can access it or not everybody knows about it, who is food insecure.” He would also like to work with local grocery stores to create a food bank that gives nearly-expired food for free to students.</span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.

Graduate Student Association (APIGSA) and the Asian American Studies Department spoke about their experiences at the university and grievances they hold with the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several speakers talked about the lack of resources allocated for Asian and Asian American students on campus, with some noting that almost one third of UCSB’s student population identifies as Asian. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smita Narasimhan, social media coordinator for Pan Asian Network, talked about the failure of the university to recognize the many identities within the label of Asian or Asian American. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We come from so many diverse cultures, languages, religions and we need to embrace all of that, but by designating all of us under one umbrella with one word, that’s taking all those differences away,” Narasimhan said during the rally. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Narasimhan said she hopes the fulfillment of the demands will create a campus where her Asian identity will be acknowledged. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Maybe at the end of this, I can feel comfortable calling myself Asian again.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diane Fujino, a professor of Asian American studies, also spoke at the rally, urging students to “mobilize and organize” to create the changes needed for the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fujino said that not only do the 2019 demands build upon the Asian and Asian-American community demands in 2017 and the Black Student Union demands from </span><a

marched into Cheadle Hall and chanted in protest while ascending the stairs to the fifth floor, where Vice Chancellor Margaret Klawunn and Executive Assistant in the Office of the Chancellor Diane O’Brien received the list of demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pan Asian Network members then listed the staff they required to be present at the meeting and requested that a meeting to discuss the demands with the Chancellor Henry T. Yang be held on Friday, May 3.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn said the demands and the request for the meeting would be passed on to Chancellor Yang. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the meeting date is not fulfilled, Pan Asian Network and other groups plan to take stronger action to compel the university to meet their demands, according to Donna Anderson, member of APIGSA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If that doesn’t happen, if Chancellor Yang is unable to make that possible, then it turns into direct action. It’s gonna be more rallies, more advocacy, greater activism on campus and we won’t be silent. We’re not gonna let this go,” Anderson said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Anderson, the demands come down to an essential problem with how the Asian and Asian-American communities are seen on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are invisible. Our needs aren’t being met and people just assume that we’re gonna be okay because it is a reinforcement of the model minority idea that Asian and Asian-American students are gonna make do.

interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart began research on Locke in 1977 while in graduate school at Yale University. He dropped the project for a long period of time but resumed writing the biography in 1992.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I went away from it because it was so challenging … It was a very complex project. I didn’t feel like early on, coming out of graduate school, I could write the book. I had to grow as a writer,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart made use of Howard University’s exhaustive collection of Locke’s personal correspondences to paint a picture of Locke’s philosophy, life experiences, conflicts and interpersonal relationships. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A professor at Howard University, Locke left the bulk of his letters with the institution, where they were compiled in the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart pored over thousands of documents in the process of writing </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New Negro: The Life of Alain Locke.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He has voluminous letters. He had probably 5000 letters to his mother alone… He would report on what he did and where he went almost like a diary.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike historical counterparts such as Booker T. Washington or W. E. B. Du Bois, who focused on social advancement through economic efficacy and protest respectively, Locke looked at the arts and saw an opportunity to connect white audiences with Black creators, Stewart said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He’s like a facilitator. He’s like a producer of these things. He did it out of a belief that art was a way to advance the situation of race relations more positively than through other avenues,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke popularized the works of Black artists and authors such as Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston and others who “started doing poems and short stories and novels about the Black experience,” Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke believed that “art was a way to advance the situation of race relations more positively than through other avenues.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Almost like a Trojan Horse, [art] could be rode into the citadel of American culture and there would be poetry and art and all about Black people which would humanize how people thought about Black people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke faced challenges relating to his disposition, his size, his sexuality and his focus on art over other forms of activism. In the greater Black cultural narrative, Stewart believes Locke was overlooked because of these peculiarities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Take somebody like Frederick Douglass. He’s independent, a leader, a spokesperson. He’s heterosexual, he has a family. It’s like it’s the mirror of the white world, but Black. Locke was small. He was 4’11″. He weighed 99 pounds. He was into art, which is not typically the focus of Black politics. He was a difficult personality.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke’s challenges gave him a unique perspective on life, and his success and resilience in the face of dismissiveness from other activists inspired Stewart.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He never let the opposition from other people stop him, whether it was gendered or sexual, or racial, or even the issue of his size, or those people who thought that art was ridiculous to be concerned about when you’re in the midst of a racial struggle.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87719\" style=\"width: 345px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1536383264\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"87708\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87719\" data-attachment-id=\"87719\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/ucsb-professor-wins-pulitzer-prize/unnamed-1-28/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=335%2C508&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"335,508\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=335%2C508&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-87719\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=335%2C508\" alt=\"\" width=\"335\" height=\"508\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?w=335&amp;ssl=1 335w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1 165w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-87719\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of the UCSB Black studies department</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also significant to Stewart was Locke’s faith in the Black cultural capacity for change and reinvention, away from the ideals and standards imposed by white people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke believed that in altering one’s conception of oneself and embracing one’s innate qualities as a Black person, one could “acquire and gain a sense of self-esteem and agency that [one could] never acquire by trying to get what the other people have,” Stewart said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So there’s a narrative of self-sufficiency and self-determination through art.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Locke also led a life of lonesomeness which intensified after the death of the most prominent figure in Locke’s life: his mother.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Much of his life was after her death in 1922, a search for someone to replace her… and he never found that,” Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was coupled with a desire for a meaningful relationship with a man, which Locke could never fulfill, Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He had relationships but never anything that was really permanent. He felt people would get with him because of what he could do for them, they used him. He was a means, not an end.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Locke was a perpetual optimist deep down, even in his dying moments. In every aspect of his life, whether it be romantic pursuits, academic ambitions or social activism, Locke never let seemingly insurmountable disadvantages discourage him, Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart believes young people can learn from Locke. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That kind of relates to today, I think. A lot of young people come out and look at the situation. There’s a lot of controversy… but [Locke] was always hopeful, always thinking that by contributing you could make a difference.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This signature concept of</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The New Negro</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is that Black people reinvented themselves in the 20th century, away from slavery… There’s this idea that wherever you are in your life, whatever has happened, you still have the capacity for a new version of yourself,” Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“His whole thing is, well, if you believe you can change, then maybe you can.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
