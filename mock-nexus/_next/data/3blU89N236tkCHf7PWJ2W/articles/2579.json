Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p>The Office of the A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) is now asking for feedback from UCSB students on the content of UC Board of Regents’ first “Principles Against Intolerance,” which is currently being developed by a working group within the Board.</p>\n<p>The Principles Against Intolerance is a statement first drafted by the working group July 2015 stating what it considers to be “intolerable” acts, including acts of discrimination and racism. The Office of the EVPSA asks students to share what they consider to be hate speech and to share their experiences with acts of hate via welisten@sa.ucsb.edu by Jan. 30. The feedback will then be sent to the Board, who will not see names of students who participate.</p>\n<p>Mohsin Mirza, EVPSA and fourth-year black studies and sociology double major, said the Principles Against Intolerance aim to address all types of hate students might face on campus.</p>\n<p>“The goal of the statement against intolerance is to better understand the kind of challenges students are facing, not only in regards to anti-Semitism,” Mirza said, “but also in regards to anti-black, homophobia, racism and hate, which is unfortunately much more prevalent than people realize on the UC campuses.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said he encourages students to submit feedback in order to “take advantage of that opportunity” to communicate their experiences to the Regents.</p>\n<p>“I really want to encourage students who are affected by this issue and who are passionate about it to take the time to fill out their feelings and send it in to the email address provided, because it’s not often that the UC Regents takes this much student input in the crafting of policy,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>According to Aaron Jones, Graduate Student Association president, the Board will use feedback they receive to identify the main issues students face that should be addressed in the Principles Against Intolerance.</p>\n<p>“[The Board] will use the information by looking at the issues and challenges to address in the statement,” Jones said. “How to phrase the statement in a way that respects freedom of speech but also acknowledges the problems that people are facing and fully cover the broad scope of the issue.”</p>\n<p>Jones said Student Regent Avi Oved and Student Regent Designate Marcela Ramirez drafted a more “holistic” statement against hate speech despite requests from several Board members to tailor the statement to the issue of anti-Semitism.</p>\n<p>“It put the current student regent, who is Jewish, in a precarious position, because he essentially informed us that although it is important to him to fight anti-Semitism, he didn’t feel as though it was the only form of intolerance that needed to be identified,” Jones said. “We have to include intolerance against people of color, the LGBT community, women; it needed to be more inclusive.”</p>\n<p>Akshaya Natarajan, off-campus senator and second-year Asian American studies and political science double major, said the student regents, Oved and Ramirez, want to improve student representation at the Board through this opportunity to collect feedback.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s not often that the UC Regents takes this much student input in the crafting of policy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>“What the student regents this year wanted to do was to really increase the amount of student input on the statement of principles against intolerance,” Natarajan said. “I think it’s very much towards increasing student input and making sure students feel like they have the ability to give input on policy and official UC stances about free speeches.”</p>\n<p>Natarajan said she attended an open forum on the Principles at UCLA and witnessed many students with “charged” opinions.</p>\n<p>“A lot of it seemed to focus on the issue of divestment and general conversations of anti-Semitism and free speech on campus,” Natarajan said. “I think that’s the larger picture that we should be looking at: Perhaps not so much one conversation that happens, but perhaps the scope of all sorts of controversial discussions that happen on campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Jones, some have expressed concerns that the Principles Against Intolerance will infringe upon the First Amendment right to free speech.</p>\n<p>“I think that whole particular argument needs to be flushed out more because it’s just a way of pigeonholing the conversation to say, ‘I have the ability to say anything I want to’ and not have to face repercussions when that is legally is not the case,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Jones said the statement would not affect classroom discussions between students and faculty.</p>\n<p>“The entity responsible for classroom experience is academic senate, it’s the faculty,” Jones said. “There may be the statement. There may be broader parameters that are put forth as ideals. But in terms of the academic environment, that is the sole responsibility of the faculty.”</p>\n<p>Jones said the discussion of hate speech and intolerance will still continue after the statement is complete.</p>\n<p>“My hope with the ongoing conversation is that something can be agreed upon now,” Jones said. Maybe it’s not the end-all, be-all, but we can continue working on it. So it’s not something that is static.”</p>\n<p>Natarajan said the statement is still very broad and could lead to interpretations that suggest violations of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>“It’s a pretty short statement, it’s not really all inclusive,” Natarajan said. “So it does leave a lot up to interpretation, and as a result of that, there is a lot of perhaps confusion on what these principles could mean.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the Thursday, January 21, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67543\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/evpsa-principles-draft-calls-for-student-input/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67543\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/evpsa-principles-draft-calls-for-student-input/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/evpsa-principles-draft-calls-for-student-input/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/evpsa-principles-draft-calls-for-student-input/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/evpsa-principles-draft-calls-for-student-input/","id":2579,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[2578,2577,2576],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga","biography":"Not available","articles":[2578,2579,2586,2593,2645,2675,3603,3854,4609,4636],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Senate met Wednesday to discuss a bill amending the legal code of an Office of Student Advocacy bill and a resolution asking for “immediate” action in support of those without legal status.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The first proposal, “A Resolution Requesting Immediate Action in Support of the Undocumented Community,” was partially written by Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success (I.D.E.A.S.), a group advocating for the rights of undocumented immigrants at UCSB. The resolution urged A.S. to form a temporary committee to work with I.D.E.A.S. and to increase access to Counseling and Psychological Services for undocumented students. The resolution was written in response to recent Immigration and Custom Enforcement (I.C.E.) raids in California and the expected presence of Customs and Border Patrol recruiters at the Winter Career Fair. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Abby Salazar, a student sponsor of the bill and fourth-year Chican@ studies and black studies double major, said she had opened the door of her home to I.C.E. officers, not knowing “that action would change the rest of my life.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">“They immediately handcuffed my mom and sat me down,” Salazar said. “They took her away and I went into a state of panic. It’s been six years that my mom hasn’t been able to return to her home that my parents have worked for after so many years.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Salazar said many undocumented students are currently living in fear after news of the I.C.E. raids and deportations. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">“A lot of people started celebrating New Years, but we started our year with fear,” Salazar said. “We think coming back to school would be a safe space because back at home, it’s not a safe space because our families and friends are in danger of being deported”. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Mariel Islas, second-year history of public policy major, said recent news of I.C.E. raids coupled with border patrol recruiters attending the career fair may trigger fear and panic in undocumented students. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">“When customs and border patrol comes to the career fair, C.A.P.S. should be on hand with more psychologists and therapists,” Islas said. “That way, students who do feel triggered have the ability and the means to contact someone in C.A.P.S. who are able to help them.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Islas said she collaborated with A.S. senators Alejandra Melgoza and Jose Magana, who proposed that she write a resolution.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Alejandra Melgoza, an off-campus senator and third-year Chican@ studies major, said she supports the resolution because of the stress and pressure undocumented students have to face while pursuing their education. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">“There have been a lot of raids in our community,” Melgoza said. “There are articles that state they are continuing in Santa Barbara county, so this presents a lot of mental health stress not only on these students here in this community, but they also worry about their families back home, friends, community members.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">In the fall of 2013, the 64th A.S Senate voted against passing “A Resolution in Support of Undocumented Student and Immigrant Communities,” which requested A.S. express no confidence toward former Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, who is now president of the University of California.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Salazar said it is important for Senate to repair its relationship with the undocumented student population at UCSB in order to fully represent the student body. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Two years after, A.S. Senate voted down the previous resolution, Salazar said, “Now we’re back in the same place. We’re coming here for the 66th Senate to amend those actions and to really support undocumented students right now because undocumented students are facing really difficult times.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">“A Bill to Amend Lobby Corps Legal Code” and “A Bill to Update CFF By-Laws” were sent to Campus Affairs. “A Bill to Amend the Legal Code of the OSA Bill” and “A Resolution Requesting Immediate Action in Support of the Undocumented Community” were passed unanimously. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\n</p><p class=\"p4\">[Correction: This story originally read  “a resolution asking for ‘immediate’ action in support of those who immigrated to the country illegally.” The wording was changed to “those without legal status” to more accurately describe the purpose of the resolution.]</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67418\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-15/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-to-support-the-undocumented-community-amends-legal-code-bill/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67418\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-15/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-to-support-the-undocumented-community-amends-legal-code-bill/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-15/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-to-support-the-undocumented-community-amends-legal-code-bill/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-15/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-to-support-the-undocumented-community-amends-legal-code-bill/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-15/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-to-support-the-undocumented-community-amends-legal-code-bill/","id":2578,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[2577,2576,2575],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Wells Fargo this week to divest from private prisons.</p>\n<p>Students from the Afrikan Black Coalition (ABC), an alliance of black student groups on nine UC campuses, released a statement Monday demanding Wells Fargo sell its shares in private prisons and end all business relations with the companies by Feb. 20. According to the statement, if Wells Fargo fails to do so by the deadline, ABC will continue to pressure the UC to divest its $425 million invested with Wells Fargo. ABC pressured UC to divest from private prisons in December, prompting UC to sell approximately $25 million in private prison shares.</p>\n<p>Nia Mitchell, UCSB Black Student Union Political Chair and fourth-year environmental studies major, said black students remain upset that the UC invests in Wells Fargo despite selling its shares in private prison corporations. Mitchell said she believes Wells Fargo contributes to private prison funding.</p>\n<p>“We cannot be complacent with the fact that our tuition is being invested, either indirectly or directly, to the incarceration of our people,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>ABC spokesperson Anthony Williams, citing research conducted by Enlace’s Private Prison Divestment Campaign, said Wells Fargo is financially invested in private prison corporations such as Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) and The GEO Group (GEO) in several ways.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, Wells Fargo owns 1.5 million shares in GEO and CCA, acts as an issuing lender on CCA’s $900 million line of credit and serves as bond trustee to GEO’s $300 million corporate debt.</p>\n<p>“They are funding private prisons,” Williams said. “Wells Fargo is completely complicit in private prisons and what they do and how they treat people, which is horrid.”</p>\n<p>According to Wells Fargo spokesperson Ruben Pulido, the bank bears no financial investment in either GEO or CCA. Pulido said Wells Fargo Funds, owned by the funds’ investors and not Wells Fargo, currently holds a small position in the companies through a passive index fund.</p>\n<p>“Wells Fargo holds no investment in either The GEO Group or the Corrections Corporation of America,” Pulido said in an email. “We have no seat on either company’s board of directors, and we do not dictate their policies or business models.”</p>\n<p>UCSB economics professor Henning Bohn said Wells Fargo provides passive index funds for customers to invest in other companies, which is a product that “any random financial firm” would offer to its customers. Bohn said Wells Fargo customers own the shares in private prison corporations, not Wells Fargo.</p>\n<p>“From an economic perspective, I would say [Wells Fargo] doesn’t really hold an economic interest because the interest is held by their customers — those are the beneficiaries,” Bohn said.</p>\n<p>Bohn said if Wells Fargo were to end all investments in private prison corporations through index funds, the bank would first have to withdraw all index fund products, and would only offer funds investing in companies in which the bank wants clients to invest.</p>\n<p>“That’s something that Wells Fargo is probably not going to do,” Bohn said.</p>\n<p>Mitchell said she does not believe the distinction between Well Fargo and Wells Fargo Funds makes a difference.</p>\n<p>“It’s still Wells Fargo,” Mitchell said. “You can separate it however you want bureaucratically, but it is the arm of the same system.”</p>\n<p>According to Mitchell, black student leaders want UC and other “financiers” to divest from for-profit prisons because of how incarceration oppresses black people.</p>\n<p>“Private prisons literally make a profit off of the incarceration of people, who, within a system that’s rooted in white supremacy and capitalism, are for the most part black and brown bodies,” Mitchell said. “Their system of mass incarceration has not helped the black community.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the business model of private prisons requires they lobby for criminal justice and immigration policies to incarcerate as many people as possible. Williams also said these policies generally lead to the disproportionate number of racial minorities in the prison facilities of corporations like GEO and CCA.</p>\n<p>“Their business model is getting as many people incarcerated as possible and having contracts, and if they can’t do that, then how are they going to make money?” Williams said.</p>\n<p>According to CCA Director of Public Affairs Jonathan Burns, CCA does not take an active stance on public policies affecting incarceration.</p>\n<p>“To be clear, CCA does not draft, lobby for or in any way promote policies that determine the basis for or duration of an individual’s incarceration or detention,” Burns said in an email.</p>\n<p>GEO Vice President of Corporate Relations Pablo Paez also said he “vehemently refutes” these charges.</p>\n<p>“The allegation that our company has engaged in lobbying and advocacy for public policies that are detrimental to communities is simply not accurate,” Paez said. “Our company has never taken a position on criminal justice or immigration policies.”</p>\n<p>Paez said GEO helps those who are incarcerated by investing millions of dollars into rehabilitation and re-entry programs for prisoners to transition more smoothly back into society.</p>\n<p>“Groups like this one advance the notion that groups in our industry are somehow unaccountable to the government and to the public,” Paez said. “What we’ve done over the years is counter the rhetoric that is being advanced by groups like that of the University of California.”</p>\n<p>Williams said there is nothing a private prison corporation like GEO can do to be accountable to the public except to close its doors.</p>\n<p>“For private prison organizations to be accountable to the public, they would have to shut down,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Jan. 14 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67385\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/students-demand-private-prison-divestment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67385\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/students-demand-private-prison-divestment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/students-demand-private-prison-divestment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/students-demand-private-prison-divestment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/students-demand-private-prison-divestment/","id":2577,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2576,2575,2574],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
