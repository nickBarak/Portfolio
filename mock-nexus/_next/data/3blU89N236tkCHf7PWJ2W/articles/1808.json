At the Folino Invitational, Santa Barbara finished in second place out of 10 teams and placed higher than UCI, who finished in third, and UCR, who finished in sixth.</p>\n<p>In its last outing, UCSB certainly looked like a really solid team and had many opportunities to defeat Long Beach State and end up getting first in the entire invitational. The squad finished with a final tally of a 10-over par 874 and only a two-point difference in its loss against LBSU, who finished 8-over par 874.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Junior Zach Smith was a key component in the Gauchos’ high finish and will look to continue being a force as an individual golfer as well. At the Folino Invitational, Smith was bested by Long Beach State’s Joe Fryer, putting him in second place; however, the former 2014 Big West Freshman of the Year played a solid outing finishing 2-under par 214.</p>\n<p>“Outstanding tournament, a hard course and finishing two under par is outstanding. But he hit a quadruple-bogey on the 12th hole and missed his opportunity to win the individual,” Head Coach Steve Lass said.</p>\n<p>At the Farms Golf Club, UCSB will expect to play Smith, freshman Brett Bennett, junior Brandon Bauman, junior Willy Moffly and sophomore Tyler See. Bennett, Bauman and Moffly all finished in the top 10 individually, with Bennett finishing the highest tied for seventh.</p>\n<p>Monday’s invitational will be no joke, as the Farms Golf Club located in Rancho Santa Fe is one of the hardest courses to play on. The course begins with easy holes; however, the difficulty definitely varies as players go on. It spans 7211 yards and has a total par of 72.</p>\n<p>“This will be the most difficult course we will play in all year,” Lass said. “But it can definitely help us grow, and I think we will play well.”</p>\n<p>Notching a second-place finish in its first tournament of the new year was definitely a nice way to start 2017, but Coach Lass knows this team still has its kinks to work out if it wants to take home the Big West championship this year.</p>\n<p>“We are one of the top teams in the Big West. On any given day we are as good as anyone and I like our chances, but we do have to minimize our mistakes,” Lass said.</p>\n<p>UCSB golf begins the Pro Compression/Folino Invitational at 8 a.m. on Monday, Feb. 13, at the Farms Golf Club.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

he works into the evening, sometimes staying until 9 p.m., or returns to the lab after having dinner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The routine makes for a long day for Magnuson, but the extra hours in the lab and late nights are worth it, he said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After a long day of work, your body starts to hurt and you’re really tired, but it’s reinvigorating to know that these devices are going straight from our hands to the hospital,” Magnuson said. “I think that that’s really what’s keeping me going right now, just the fact that we can have such an immediate impact.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The urgent production of face shields on campus is just one example of how skilled students, researchers and scientists from UCSB are uniting to help the community through the coronavirus pandemic. When the campus was still open, another group of researchers in the Materials Department made batches of hand sanitizer for community use. And presently, professors across campus are developing a coronavirus test that would be simpler and faster than the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) coronavirus test.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Face Shield Production</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back in the CNSI lab, Magnuson and David Bothman, the organizer behind the face shield production, work opposite shifts to keep the 3D printer running to produce as many parts as possible for the face shields. The shields, which are meant to go over medical goggles and face masks, consist of a transparent shield, headband and strap, all based off a </span><a href=\"https://budmen.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">design created by a 3D printer manufacturer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. By early April, the team had created and delivered 40 face shields to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital and had 40 more ready for delivery. But the hospital’s needs are “tremendous,” said Bothman, who normally lectures on mechanical engineering at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The hospital needs 10,000 shields of the style we’re making. We can make, you know, 20 or 30 a day … but it’s clear that a lot of other people and people with a lot more manufacturing capability are going to need to be involved,” Bothman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other groups on campus have joined in the production of face shields, including Roger Green, manager at the chemistry and biochemistry machine shop. He and Andy Weinberg, the machine shop superintendent, obtained enough materials to make 3,000 face shields. The two had finished cutting the clear plastic covers for 200 shields with a 3D printer in early April and with the help of a couple more people in the production process, Green said his team would likely soon be able to produce about 200 clear plastic covers a day.</span></p>\n<p><b>Hand Sanitizer Production</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over in the Materials Department, Assistant Professor Angela Pitenis had been worrying about the coronavirus pandemic early on. Before </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-10/breaking-ucsb-to-transition-to-remote-instruction-beginning-tomorrow-through-end-of-april/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB canceled in-person classes on March 10</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, she cut the normal lesson plans she had for her graduate class, Colloids and Interfaces,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and instead presented on the colloidal formation and stability properties of hand sanitizer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking notice of the rising anxiety over coronavirus among the students in her class, she decided to dedicate a lecture to demonstrate how to make basic hand sanitizer. Then she had the idea to produce hand sanitizer for the entire campus community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This whole project really began as a truly class exercise to demonstrate basic principles, but it also links back to the work that we do every day in materials science,” Pitenis said. “I think it was a very good lesson for the students to be able to see how lessons in the classroom can translate to practical engineering solutions, especially in response to COVID-19.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joining forces with colleagues Rachel Segalman, Raphaële Clément, Craig Hawker, Christopher Bates and Michael Chabinyc, all professors in the UCSB Materials Department, the group pooled together their reagents to begin manufacturing hand sanitizer in their labs for community usage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Basically, any kinds of solutions we could find, we would put them together,” Pitenis recalled. She said she isn’t sure how much hand sanitizer they made altogether, but she estimates “gallons.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Segalman’s lab members, chemical engineering doctoral student Audra Destefano, came up with the creative idea to design a label and call their hand sanitizer “Universal Corona Sanitizing Balm.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The name], which was very clever … really encapsulated the efforts we were trying to do here, which was to support our community,” Pitenis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The scientists distributed their hand sanitizer around campus, including among their shared facilities, the Materials Research Lab and the CNSI.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the hand sanitizer went directly to those shared facilities to support students and staff at the time who were still having to use those shared facilities to maintain their critical research, and also to support our staff, who might not have time in between experiments to wash their hands,” Pitenis described.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Pitenis emphasized handwashing over hand sanitizer, noting that it is more effective and a practice that the CDC </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/pdf/hand-sanitizer-factsheet.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recommends</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since campus operations, including most research labs, have shut down, Pitenis and her colleagues have ceased their hand sanitizer production, for now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think we’ve made enough to support the needs of our community,” she remarked, adding that if there was a need for more, her team could always produce additional hand sanitizer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think we’re all trying to help out as much as we can; I think this is a total team effort right now. And I’m just incredibly amazed and I’m just humbled by the efforts of my colleagues,” Pitenis said.</span></p>\n<p><b>Coronavirus Test Development </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Across campus, four professors from the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (MCDB) are working tirelessly to develop a coronavirus test that would be faster and easier to use and would not “rely on the common reagents that the rest of the world is scrambling to get,” said Max Wilson, an assistant professor in the MCDB department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilson, Carolina Arias, Diego Acosta-Alvear and Kenneth Kosik all know each other from teaching and working together in the MCDB department, but as the coronavirus pandemic tore through U.S. communities and the lack of available testing became more obvious, the group stepped up to help fill the gap in resources and information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We saw that there was a massive need for testing and we decided that we would use our labs and our skills as molecular biologists to help,” Wilson said. “We were all scientists studying other things before this. We dedicated funds from [other projects] to develop this because we saw how important it was.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the CDC’s test as a benchmark for accuracy, the team created a test for coronavirus that uses an enzyme similar to the family of enzymes used in a CRISPR test, a method that </span><a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/16/coronavirus-test-crispr-mammoth-biosciences/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scientists around the nation have already begun to tap into</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that targets repetitive DNA sequences. This test uses the enzyme to recognize the presence of the coronavirus viral genome and indicates a positive or negative result on a lateral flow dipstick, a testing device similar to those used for pregnancy tests, according to Wilson.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the beginning of April, the group was tinkering with adjustments to the test to make it cheaper and easier to use. The professors also began looking into the process of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, which is currently being fast tracked for coronavirus tests but could still likely take months. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s gonna be a long way, unfortunately,” Arias said. “We are still far. I don’t want to give anybody false expectations or false hope </span>that we’re going to have something that can be deployed tomorrow. It is a process [that requires] approval.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to developing a new coronavirus test, the professors </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also donated enough critical reagents, an essential component in the current CDC coronavirus test, for 600 tests to the Cottage Health laboratory, the Santa Barbara Independent </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2020/04/02/ucsb-molecular-biologists-to-the-rescue/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arias’ role in the project has been to coordinate approval processes and navigate protocols for the research to take place. Besides that, she also teaches general animal virology to a class of 185 students remotely –– a task faced by UCSB’s entire teaching faculty and one they had a mere </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-24/pandemic-pedagogy-faculty-prepares-for-first-quarter-of-remote-instruction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two weeks to prepare for</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> –– and serves on UCSB’s COVID-19 Response Working Group. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And we have families so we don’t stop. If it’s not one thing, it’s another one,” Arias said. “I cannot even tell you at what time [the day] begins or what time it ends.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the researchers are propelled by an extreme sense of urgency to find solutions and provide information to the public, a collective effort they “hope is going to be significant” in the community’s fight against coronavirus, Arias said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking ahead, the team is discussing the possibility of using their coronavirus test in a research project that would focus on the prevalence of coronavirus in asymptomatic patients.

Epstein and Colby ended the tournament in 17th and 41st place, respectively.</p>\n<p>Another notable performance by the Gauchos was delivered by sophomore Amol Mahal who placed 36th overall by shooting 17-over par 233.</p>\n<p>The tournament marks the final competition for the Gauchos this season as they look to build on what they accomplished this year going forward. With only two seniors on the current roster, the team will rely on its core group of returning players for next season.</p>\n<p>“Building on what we did in those last two rounds I think is really going to be one of our goals going into next year,” Ley said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 2nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Photo Courtesy of Tony Mastres</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51147\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/gauchos-take-fourth-at-conference-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51147\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/gauchos-take-fourth-at-conference-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/gauchos-take-fourth-at-conference-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/gauchos-take-fourth-at-conference-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/gauchos-take-fourth-at-conference-championship/","id":1807,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1806,1805,1804],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Finishes Warrior Princeville Makai Invitational","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Golf","publish_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos finish 14th out of 18 teams in Hawaii","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s golf team traveled to the Warrior Princeville Makai Invitational Tournament hosted by the Hawaii Makai Golf Course in Princeville, Hawaii from November 4-6.
