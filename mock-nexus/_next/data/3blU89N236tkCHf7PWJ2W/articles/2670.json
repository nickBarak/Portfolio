Senate passes bills to establish student councils, redefine S.T.A.R.K. funds, and create a digital database. <em>John Clow/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students (A.S) Senate met Wednesday evening in the Flying A Room in the UCen to discuss three bills.</p>\n<p>Senate voted on and passed “A Bill to Establish a Student Council for the College of Creative Studies (CCS) and College of Engineering (CoE)” and “A Bill to Reform the Science, Technology, Aerospace and Research Kapital (S.T.A.R.K.) Fund” and moved “A Bill to Promote Increased Transparency in A.S.” to the Campus Affairs Committee. Public forum included first-year CCS music composition major Jordan Mitchell and Senate Coordinator and Director of Accountability Michelle May. Senators also provided a report of the “Breakfast with Librarians.”</p>\n<p>Mitchell said he supports the creation of the CCS and CoE student council to improve campus representation in A.S.</p>\n<p>“It is within our rights as an underrepresented college to be equally represented in university and student affairs at UCSB,” Mitchell said. “It will provide crucial space for CCS representation, helping [allow us] to do much more things.”</p>\n<p>May said each senator must fulfill their senate responsibilities as outlined in the A.S. legal code.</p>\n<p>“You all must undertake four or five projects this year,” May said.  “And one must be a group project.”</p>\n<p>According to Internal Vice President and fourth-year sociology major Kimia Hashemian, senators had previously discussed the potential features of the new library space during the “Breakfast with Librarians” event.</p>\n<p>“The students wanted more outlets, so we are giving them outlets.” Hashemian said. “Another thing they’re really interested in — Senator [Jerel] Constantino brought this up — is e-books, so e-coursereaders, since textbook affordability is number one in their priority.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and second-year undeclared major Natalie Jordan said she talked with librarians about creating resource centers, such as a space for mental health services in the library.</p>\n<p>“There’s going to be a transfer center in the inside of the library,” Jordan said. “They were super unwilling to have C.A.P.S. [Counseling &amp; Psychological Services] — they wanted it to be strictly a study space.”</p>\n<p>The consent calendar was passed during this meeting, which included “A Bill to Create a Self-Care Portion for the Declaration of Candidacy Meeting,” “A Resolution to Create a Group Project For the Alternative Transportation Project,” “A Resolution to Create an Ad-Hoc Committee to Fill the Vacant On-Campus Senator Positions” and “A Resolution in Support of a Student Advisor Position to the UC Board of Regents and UC Regent Avi Oved’s Shared Governance Proposals.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year history of public policy and political science double-major Jerel Constantino presented Austin Hechler’s bill “A Resolution to Make A.S. More Transparent,” which outlines the plan to improve A.S transparency through creating a digital database for important documents, including reports, minutes, bills, resolutions, projects and other related documents.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 12 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65682\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/a-s-senate-talks-student-councils-s-t-a-r-k-funds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65682\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/a-s-senate-talks-student-councils-s-t-a-r-k-funds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/a-s-senate-talks-student-councils-s-t-a-r-k-funds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/a-s-senate-talks-student-councils-s-t-a-r-k-funds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/a-s-senate-talks-student-councils-s-t-a-r-k-funds/","id":2670,"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez"},"related":[2669,2668,2667],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez","biography":"Not available","articles":[2516,2571,2611,2670,2679,2694,3939,3962,3971,3974,3975,3976,3977],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Love Your Body Week To Spread Positivity and Knowledge","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Contraception_Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Contraception_Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB Women’s Center is hosting the third annual Love Your Body Week Oct. 19 to Oct. 23 both in Isla Vista and on campus to promote the knowledge and love of one’s own body.

A panel of women comprised of two Planned Parenthood representatives, two Student Health representatives and two UCSB Women’s Center representatives discussed a variety of different methods for birth control. The six women dispelled common myths about each type of birth control, answered questions from attendees and demonstrated the usage of certain contraceptives with plastic models.</p>\n<p>Events for Love Your Body Week include pumpkin carving on Wednesday, a Zumba lesson on Thursday and a henna and body art activity taking place on Friday.</p>\n<p>Third-year biology major Marisa Allan said she attended the event to inquire about birth control pills and came away with knowledge on various other forms of birth control such as an Internal Uterine Device (IUD).</p>\n<p>“I like the open discussion because it takes the ‘sex is bad’ stigma away from talking about this,” Allan said. “I’d rather everyone be informed than regret something they might do.”</p>\n<p>Second-year math major Tao Nguyen, who tabled for Love Your Body Week on Monday, said she volunteered to be a part of the event because she wanted to be involved in an organization that provided “outreach for anyone.” According to Nguyen, loving your body includes loving your physical body as well as your sexuality.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65620\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a

Nguyen said. “There’s this standard of heterosexual, feminine females and masculine males, which are the two types that are portrayed, but there is so much diversity that we shouldn’t just be accepting our own but cut others, too.”</p>\n<p>Second-year psychology major Lauren Paiste said she attended the discussion to learn more about basic contraceptive methods.</p>\n<p>“The open

Dordi said Love Your Body Week is about “body positivity” and the discussions surrounding it.</p>\n<p>“We think [body positivity] is really important at the Women’s Center, specifically to women, but also to absolutely everybody; the way that people’s bodies are talked about, and the way they’re controlled,” Dordi said.</p>\n<p>For more information on Love Your Body Week check the Love Your Body

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>With about 24 hours until UC Santa Barbara’s spring concert on Sunday, many non-students are still trying to snag a ticket. But the concert, Extravaganza, is only open to UCSB students, meaning that tickets come in the form of borrowed — or purchased — student ID cards.</p>\n<p>Several students have already been referred to UCSB’s Office of Judicial Affairs for trying to rent or sell their IDs to non-UCSB students, and a Facebook search returned more than 40 posts either seeking or selling a student access card.</p>\n<p>Sarah Yang, who graduated from UCSB after Winter Quarter, wanted to go to the concert but is visiting Las Vegas with friends instead.</p>\n<p>She decided to make some extra cash by posting her ID on Facebook and received about 10 offers ranging from $20 to $50. In the end, though, Yang passed up on the money and gave her ID to a friend who needed one.</p>\n<p>“I understand why they want to close it off — we all pay our tuition,” Yang said. “We’ve had Deltopia and we’ve had crazy riots happening and I understand why they want to keep it within the school.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Program Board (ASPB), the student-funded organization hosting the concert, has hired professional security for the event and instructed them to look for certain things on students’ ID cards.</p>\n<p>“We gave them specific instructions — this is what the card has to look like, you have to make sure the face matches the card, you have to make sure it’s not scratched out to where you can’t see the face,” said Alex Levine, the special events coordinator for ASPB.</p>\n<p>Levine said that while ASPB does have machines to scan the ID cards, she is not sure if they will be used on Sunday, but Program Board has been monitoring social media sites and referring students to Judicial Affairs.</p>\n<p>Katya Armistead, the dean of student life, said students who are flagged as having sold their ID card will, at the very least, have to speak with an administrator.</p>\n<p>“There’s not a set consequence. I would definitely at the very least call the student in to have a conversation,” Armistead said, adding that “it’s not a witch hunt.”</p>\n<p>Armistead said she knows this has been a problem for years, but was surprised, this year, when she saw people pop up on her own Facebook feed selling IDs.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a problem, it’s happened before, but I’d never seen it — me, I see it!” she said.</p>\n<p>One first-year UCSB student, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because selling and buying ID cards is against school policy, said she sees why the students-only policy exists, but wanted to be able to bring her boyfriend.</p>\n<p>“It’s understandable, like I get it, but it sucks, you know?” she said. “I totally understand it, but I’m still trying to get around it.”</p>\n<p>The first-year student posted on Facebook looking to buy an ID for $15. She was contacted by someone renting out their ID for $45, far more than she was willing to pay.</p>\n<p>“It might be worth it if it was a concert ticket, but it’s just an access card, you know,” said the student, who is still looking for a way to bring her boyfriend to Extravaganza on Sunday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"
