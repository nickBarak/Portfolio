Entering the final series of the year at 33-18 overall and 13-5 in the Big West, Santa Barbara is tied for first in the league standings. If the Gauchos win the series, they win their first-ever conference title. If not, they go home with nothing.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s a better feeling that it’s on us to win instead of having to rely on other teams to lose or to beat other teams,” junior pitcher Shelby Wisdom said. “It’s in our hands. It’s our last weekend at home and it’s our last series in conference, so we’re going to play with our hearts and go all out. We just to have to know that we’re better and that we can do it.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach travels to Santa Barbara at 36-16 overall and 13-5 in conference. Third-place Cal Poly also figures into the mix, just one game behind both the Gauchos and 49ers. The Mustangs play last-place UC Riverside this weekend.</p>\n<p>While both Santa Barbara and CSULB stand atop the standings, it is the Gauchos that carry the momentum as winners of 12 of their last 14 games. UCSB will also have the advantage of playing at home for its seniors with Senior Day on Sunday. Long Beach, on the other hand, was swept by Cal Poly last weekend to lose control of its lead in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>“We’re all really excited. Even at practice today, we had a big team talk about how we want to see our name on that selection show on Sunday,” junior third baseman Jenessa Jeppesen said. “We have to take it one game at a time.”</p>\n<p>After sweeping Riverside last weekend, sophomore catcher Meme Moore was named Big West Field Player of the Week. Moore had an incredible series, tallying a slugging percentage of .800 and a batting average of .600. In the series finale, she hit 4-4 with two runs and two RBI. Moore is currently tied for first in the Big West in doubles with 13.</p>\n<p>Last weekend, Wisdom was on her game as well, as she gave up just three earned runs in the circle while hitting 6-10 from the plate with three runs and one RBI on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>At 21-13, Wisdom is approaching an important milestone this weekend. Currently tied with Sandy Ortigies for most career wins at 62, Wisdom could etch her name into the UCSB record books with a win against Long Beach. Ortigies’ record has stood since 1987.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, the record doesn’t really matter to me unless we get those two wins,” Wisdom said. “I’m only a win away and that one win won’t matter. We need [two].”</p>\n<p>One thing these two teams have in common is that offense can come from anyone. Last weekend, the Gauchos’ offensive success was a team effort. In game one, for example, seven of 10 players in the Santa Barbara lineup got a hit and five had at least two hits.</p>\n<p>One of Santa Barbara’s biggest offensive weapons is freshman left fielder Kristen Clark, who leads the league in batting average (.432) and in hits (83). The lead-off hitter leads the league in hits by a large margin with the second-ranked player with 67, 16 less than Clark. Two weekends ago against Hawaii, she broke the single-season UCSB hits record previously owned by Assistant Coach Christine Ramos.</p>\n<p>“It helps a lot when we get our bunts down and move runners around,” Wisdom said. “Hitting is contagious, so once one person gets a hit, the next person can get a hit easier.”</p>\n<p>The 49ers’ success also relies on offensive production from multiple players. Senior second baseman Cya Neal is tied for third in the Big West in runs and ranks fifth in hits, while sophomore left fielder Darian Tautalafua sits in fifth in conference in runs. Furthermore, junior shortstop Shayna Kimbrough ranks fourth in conference in hits and third in batting average. Teammate and senior right fielder Sarah Carrasco is tied for first with Meme Moore in doubles. Senior catcher Karli Sandoval and senior first baseman Ashlynn Booker sit in third and fifth in league in RBI, respectively. Booker also ranks sixth in home runs.</p>\n<p>As a team, Long Beach leads the league in runs, hits, RBI, batting average and on-base percentage.</p>\n<p>“They can read the defense well, so we need to make sure we don’t let them read us,” Wisdom said. “[Long Beach wants] exactly what we want, so they’re going to come out and compete and we need to be ready for it.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, senior Erin Jones-Wesley is LBSU’s top-pitcher. Her ERA of 2.96 ranks third in the Big West. UCSB, meanwhile, will counter with Wisdom, who ranks fifth at 3.17.</p>\n<p>The 49ers also have depth in their bullpen and will look to junior Amanda Hansen as well, who ranks just behind Wisdom in ERA at 3.17.</p>\n<p>“The biggest thing for us is taking it one pitch at a time,” Jeppesen said. “We need to not get too excited and stay composed and play our best.”</p>\n<p>First pitch is set for noon tomorrow. After tomorrow’s double-header, the series will wrap up Saturday with game three beginning at noon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 6 of May 8, 2014’s print

In particular, the Gauchos will need someone to step up in the absence of Drew Edelman, who led the team with 16.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>Despite fielding a relatively inexperienced front court, UCSB boasts an experienced backcourt, with sophomore Danae Miller, last season’s starting point guard, returning to allow some continuity.</p>\n<p>In addition, the team will welcome back junior Coco Miller, who missed all of last season due to injury.</p>\n<p>Two years ago, however, Miller averaged 9.1 per game. Miller also will allow the Gauchos to stretch the defense, as her 111 three pointers made are already the seventh most in program history.</p>\n<p>If the exhibition game against Cal St. San Bernardino was any evidence, the team will likely use a committee approach to filling Edelman’s presence.</p>\n<p>Junior center Natalia Bruning led the team last Monday with 18 points and 15 rebounds, while sophomore guard Bri Anugwom chipped in 15 points on 5-8 shooting from the floor.</p>\n<p>Anugwom, a community college transfer who scored 20 points per game for West Los Angeles CC, should provide a solid scoring spark for the team off the bench.</p>\n<p>With a tough non-conference schedule, Hendrickson will need the seven new faces on the team this season to get acclimated to Division 1 basketball quickly.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ biggest test will come Nov. 15 when they travel to Los Angeles to take on USC. Later in the non-conference slate, Santa Barbara is also scheduled to take on UNLV, St. Mary’s, Cal and San Diego State.</p>\n<p>The team’s schedule won’t get any easier when they open up conference play against CSUN on Jan. 5, with the Matadors picked first in the preseason Big West coaches poll. In that game, the Gauchos will be looking to avenge their tournament loss from last season.</p>\n<p>They weren’t able to avoid a loss in their first game at Utah Valley, falling 63-54 to the Wolverines. The lone bright spot for UCSB on Tuesday night was Natalaia Bruening’s 20 point, 11 rebound performance on 9 of 14 shots.</p>\n<p>Without Edelman in the lineup this season, there’s potential for Bruening to break out as the team’s primary scoring option down low.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will have the chance to get its season back on track when it takes on CSU Bakersfield at home this weekend.</p>\n<p>Last season, the Roadrunners went 18-14 overall, falling just short in the WAC tournament final. The team returns without its leading scorer from last season, senior forward Aja Williams, who averaged nearly 13 points a game off the bench last season.</p>\n<p>Where Bakersfield dominated last season was on the defensive end, giving up only 56 points per game to its opponents while causing nearly 18 turnovers per game. While the Roadrunners scored merely 61 points per game last year, their solid defense enabled them to go 10-4 in the conference.</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams met was in 2015 when Santa Barbara came away with a 61-60 victory.</p>\n<p>Ironically enough, that game was Hendrickson’s first game in charge of the Gauchos. UCSB will look to repeat that success on Friday, eager to avoid the slow start that plagued the team last season.</p>\n<p>For a young and inexperienced Gaucho team, building confidence in non-conference play will be key. In a wide-open Big West conference, anything is possible — all UCSB needs is a couple players to step up in the absence of Edelman. If they can do that, look for Santa Barbara to surpass expectations this season.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 08</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

So now that we’ve swept Riverside, we’re tied with Long Beach in first, so it’s pretty big.”</p>\n<p>After giving up 19 runs last weekend to Hawaii, Wisdom was back on her game. Wisdom gave up just four runs over the weekend, three earned, improving to 21-13 on the season. The win was the 62nd of her career, which ties Sandy Ortigies’ record set in 1987 for the most wins in Gaucho history.</p>\n<p>“Hawaii is a really strong hitting team, so I expected them to score off of me, but this weekend I worked on keeping the ball low,” Wisdom said.</p>\n<p>In yesterday’s 5-3 victory to clinch the series, UCSB jumped out to a 5-1 lead. However, in the closest game of the series, Riverside wasn’t going to allow the Gauchos an easy victory.</p>\n<p>With one out in the seventh inning, junior shortstop Kris DeAnda doubled to score freshman right fielder Sommer Wilson and cut the deficit to two runs. UCR continued to rally, putting two runners in scoring position, but could not come up with the hit to tie the game.</p>\n<p>Sophomore catcher MeShalon “Meme” Moore anchored Santa Barbara offensively, hitting 4-4 with two runs and two RBI. Wisdom also scored two runs on 2-3 hitting.</p>\n<p>“We know we can hit the ball and string in hits and have a strong defense,” Wisdom said. “That helped us having a really good defense this weekend.”</p>\n<p>Game two of Saturday’s double header saw a 3-0 victory for UCSB as the entire team got involved offensively. Wisdom went 3-4 at the plate while senior second baseman Kathryn Pilpil hit 2-3 with one run and one RBI. Senior first baseman Lauren Boser also went 1-2 with 2 RBI, and freshman left fielder Kristen Clark, who broke the single season hits record last weekend, hit 3-4.</p>\n<p>UCSB first got on the board in the third inning when Pilpil singled to score the eventual game-winning run. In the fifth, the Gauchos were able to get numerous runners on base due to Riverside sophomore pitcher Sophie Slagle walking batters. Three of her five walks came in this inning. With the bases loaded once again, Boser singled to center field, scoring two runners and clinching the game.</p>\n<p>Winning the first game 4-1, seven of 10 players in the Gauchos’ rotation got a hit and five had at least two hits as they outhit UCR 13-5.</p>\n<p>“It’s really important that all of us were hitting, moving runners and scoring them,” Wisdom said. “It helps a lot and helps us score more easily.”</p>\n<p>Unlike the final two games, the Highlanders got on the board first. Their best hitter, senior center fielder Dionne Anderson, singled and stole second before junior first baseman Karina Romero singled up the middle to score Anderson.

No one really gets to say they’ve played with their sister at the DI level.”</p>\n<p>The two are nearly inseparable. Not only do they go to school and play together, but they live together as well.</p>\n<p>“There’s only one time we’ve been apart and that’s when I was a senior in high school and she was a freshman in college,” Meme said. “That was actually really hard for me because she’s always been with me. For the first week she was gone, I slept in her bed.”</p>\n<p>As Sacramento natives, DeJanee and Meme have played softball together their entire lives and in 2011, won a Sac-Joaquin Section Division I Championship together at Sheldon High School.</p>\n<p>“I think we batted back-to-back (in high school), so it was the Moore duo,” DeJanee said. “It was cool to share that moment with her. [Playing together isn’t] new to us. Over the years, we’ve gotten closer. I don’t think when we were younger we liked it very much.”</p>\n<p>The sisters even committed to UCSB at the same time, deciding to play softball in Santa Barbara when DeJanee was 15 and Meme was 14.</p>\n<p>“She wanted to go to the same school as me, but I [originally] didn’t, being with her all the time,” Meme said. “Plus, we committed early, so we weren’t as close as we are now. I wanted to go to a different school and branch out and get my space, but it worked out.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, despite their closeness and genetics, the Moore sisters have very different personalities and are extremely different players.</p>\n<p>“Their personalities are so different; that’s what makes it even more fun,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “They live together and to hear them talk with each other, there’s a mutual respect and love, but they also give each other a hard time. It’s fun to see.”</p>\n<p>DeJanee is energetic and the leader of the two sisters while Meme is more calm and laid-back.</p>\n<p>Their personality differences are exhibited through their choice of majors too. DeJanee is a communication major while Meme is pursing art.</p>\n<p>“I can remember back to when they came to one of our camps. They had already committed and this was the first time really working them,” Galicinao said. “I think Dej was at third and Meme was at shortstop and [DeJanee] was on [Meme] about not talking enough. She was like, ‘You need to be talking loud enough. Coach Brie wants someone who’s loud.’ And [Meme] just looked at her and was like, ‘See how mean she is to me?’ It was funny.”</p>\n<p>These differences also translate onto the softball field. Meme will be found behind home plate as Santa Barbara’s catcher while DeJanee is listed as a utility player for UCSB, mostly playing different positions in the infield.</p>\n<p>DeJanee is known as a quicker player offensively, ranking second on the team in on-base percentage. She is often used as a designated hitter for the Gauchos as well.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Meme is more of a power-hitter, ranking second on the team in runs, third on team in hits and leading the team in doubles. This past week, Meme was named Big West Field Player of the Week after posting an .800 slugging percentage, .600 batting average and four runs in UCSB’s sweep over UC Riverside. She also hit 4-4 in Sunday’s game to clinch the series and move into a tie with Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>“Meme is a more relaxed player,” DeJanee said. “She’s super calm and I’m a person that gets really nervous and anxious. We’re totally opposites, especially hitting.”</p>\n<p>While siblings who are on the same team have the potential to create drama, playing different positions has allowed the Moore sisters to avoid any rivalry.</p>\n<p>“I just remember the one time my child ball coach tried to make my sister a catcher,” Meme said. “I was like, ‘No. She can’t play my position.’”</p>\n<p>Playing the same position didn’t last long. DeJanee quickly returned to the infield, allowing the Moore sisters to support each other in a way only a sibling bond can. With such different personalities, DeJanee and Meme play off each other well. They know how to support and complement each other on the field.</p>\n<p>“We know each other the best, so when I tell her something, it’s because I know what she’s doing and I know I can help her,” DeJanee said. “That’s what I like about having my sister on the team. She knows me and she’s that person I can go to no matter what.”</p>\n<p>This weekend, UCSB has the opportunity to win a Big West Championship. Building off the Moore sisters’ energy and belief in each other might just give UCSB the edge it needs to take it all.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 7th’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photos by Dustin Harris and Anna Kodelashvili of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55182\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/same-blood-same-team-opposite-personalities/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55182\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/same-blood-same-team-opposite-personalities/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/same-blood-same-team-opposite-personalities/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/same-blood-same-team-opposite-personalities/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/same-blood-same-team-opposite-personalities/","id":1068,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1067,1066,1065],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
