He said one of the markings on a university building was made using permanent marker, making it “more of a vandalism type incident.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Olson said officers are reviewing surveillance video and asked that any students with information contact the department.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">More than 200 students, faculty and administrators attended a town hall style meeting Thursday at Corwin Pavilion to discuss both the importance of free speech and how that free speech can make students, specifically racial and religious minorities, feel unsafe.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">“This is going to be really tense,” said one student as she walked into the town hall, but the meeting was surprisingly civil after an initial argument over whether recording should be allowed.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69641\" style=\"width: 348px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69641\" data-attachment-id=\"69641\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-10/free-speech-questions-remain-after-chalk-washed-away/town-hall-by-alex-nagase-online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Town-Hall-by-Alex-Nagase-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Town Hall 4-7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Town-Hall-by-Alex-Nagase-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Town-Hall-by-Alex-Nagase-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69641\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Town-Hall-by-Alex-Nagase-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=338%2C224\" alt=\"Alex Nagase / Daily Nexus\" width=\"338\" height=\"224\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Town-Hall-by-Alex-Nagase-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Town-Hall-by-Alex-Nagase-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Town-Hall-by-Alex-Nagase-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Town-Hall-by-Alex-Nagase-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Town-Hall-by-Alex-Nagase-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&amp;ssl=1 980w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Town-Hall-by-Alex-Nagase-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69641\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students responded to questions at a town hall style event Thursday. <em>Alex Nagase / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Members of the UCSB community used markers to respond to questions on posters, such as “How can free speech on this campus create/disrupt our sense of community?” and “When has ‘free speech’ offended you on campus?”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Margaret Klawunn, the vice chancellor for student affairs, organized the event and said the chalk messages had escalated from<b> </b>endorsements of Donald Trump to words that “threaten” UCSB students.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">“We care about finding that line that protects free speech and where it crosses over and begins to threaten and intimidate members of our community,” Klawunn said. “The messages changed from the beginning of the week when they were statements of political belief to the end of the week when they were very purposefully placed to threaten members of our community.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">At the town hall, attendees split into groups of about 30 and responded to questions on the posters, after which one representative of each group shared their discussion.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>“</b>The general consensus in our group is that there is a difference between hate speech and free speech and that we need to be cognizant to it,” said Kathy Swift, host of KCSB’s Radio Occupy.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Chancellor Henry T.

class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">“The acts of vandalism and hate speech … were deeply disturbing and not only violated the rule of our campus but violated the core of our university,” Yang said. “Any actions that undermine our sense of community are unacceptable, unwelcome and will not to be tolerated.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Brandon Morse, fourth-year political science major, said he thought the town hall was “productive,” and that there should be a follow-up meeting that allows students to express themselves through poetry or speeches.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">“I absolutely think that town hall meetings are the correct response — we need dialogue on campus,” Morse said. “It may be able to help, now that we have a general idea, to bring it down to the individual level.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">As of Saturday, 175 current and former faculty members had signed an online <a href=\"http://www.thepetitionsite.com/882/568/757/ucsb-faculty-call-on-chancellor-yant-to-condemn-racist-defacing-of-campus/#sign\" target=\"_blank\">petition</a> calling on Chancellor Yang “to publicly condemn the defacing of our campus in the strongest terms possible.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">“The perpetrators must know that they are condemned, isolated and marginalized by the university as an institution from the highest level,” the petition reads. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Morse called this part of the petition “unfortunate.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">“It’s a sad irony in the fact that [faculty] are creating a marginalized and isolated community, and as opposed to reaching out to them … they were treating the people in the same manner that they were trying to protect the community from,” Morse said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69712\" style=\"width: 278px\" class=\"wp-caption

is organizing its own reaction. A second “Million Student March” is planned for Thursday and organizers have chosen a theme of “reclaiming” UCSB from the anonymous chalk writers.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The event description encourages students to join the march “in an effort to RECLAIM our campus after heinous, racist chalk statements targeted at many marginalized communities at UCSB.” The group says it will address “each specific chalk statement” with new “chalk walls.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b><i>University News Editor Maura Fox contributed

focused on the speakers’ ideas for a movement from a two-state solution to a focus on smaller-scale initiatives for peace. The discussion centered on the notion that for the two countries to reach a definite resolution, they must first create trustworthy relations through the reconciliation and realistic negotiations.</p>\n<p>Makovsky is an adjunct professor at John Hopkins University’s Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies. He is the co-author of Myths, Illusions, and Peace: Finding a New Direction for America in the Middle East and frequently contributes to the New York Times, the Jerusalem Post and Foreign Policy. Makovsky served as a Senior Advisor to U.S Secretary of State John Kerry during the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations of 2013 and 2014.</p>\n<p>Al-Omari formerly served as the executive director at the American Task Force on Palestine. Al-Omari has worked extensively within the Palestinian Authority, with roles including director of the International Relations Department in the Office of the Palestinian President and advisor to former Palestine Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas. He also played a key role in the Palestinian-Israeli peace process as an advisor to the Palestinian negotiation team throughout 1991-2001. He participated in negotiations leading to the Camp David Accords and the Taba Summit.</p>\n<p>According to Makovsky, both countries must wholeheartedly try to negotiate toward peace.</p>\n<p>“[An] all or nothing approach tends to be nothing,” Makovsky said.<br>\nMakovsky said current leaders are facing challenges as they try to work with a generation that “wasn’t even born when the handshake happened,” referring to the Camp David Accords.</p>\n<p>“Objectively difficult leaders that are risk averse are left with the toughest work ahead,” Makovsky said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68606\" style=\"width: 786px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68606\" data-attachment-id=\"68606\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/international-experts-join-to-discuss-palestine/paradigm2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2.jpg?fit=2285%2C3015&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2285,3015\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"paradigm2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2.jpg?fit=189%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2.jpg?fit=776%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-68606\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2-776x1024.jpg?resize=776%2C1024\" alt=\"Ari Plachta / Daily Nexus\" width=\"776\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2.jpg?resize=776%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2.jpg?resize=189%2C250&amp;ssl=1 189w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2.jpg?resize=768%2C1013&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paradigm2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 776px) 100vw, 776px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68606\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Ari Plachta / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Makovsky said a critical part of the issue is the lack of compromise.<br>\n“Instead of sharing opinions, they reflect them,” Makovsky said.</p>\n<p>Al-Omari said in order to believe progress is possible, Palestinians must see progress in their daily lives.</p>\n<p>“From a security point of view, Israel can take more measures in the West Bank that will give the Palestinians breathing room,” al-Omari said.</p>\n<p>He also said he believes a “rehabilitation of the P.A. [Palestinian Authority]” would support a new paradigm that shifts toward progress.</p>\n<p>Makovsky said he hopes it is possible to shift away from the current five negotiation points of water, settlement, Jerusalem, mutual recognition and security because he believes the “five for five” deal is too absolute.</p>\n<p>“I think what you would do is — this new paradigm, when you want to flesh it out — is to say ‘okay, we’re not going to do the five for five. We’re not going to get the grand deal on all five issues,’” Makovsky said. “‘But we’re going to single a direction towards the two states, maintain a viability.”</p>\n<p>According to Makovsky, Israelis need to see less of a military presence in order to feel safe.</p>\n<p>“The army would stay exactly where they are. Of course they’d have less of a footprint because they’d have to protect less people, but I think for the Israelis living in Jaffa, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and other cities — all they want is to be safe,” Makovsky said.</p>\n<p>Makovsky said Israeli citizens want their government to be honest in explaining the country’s situation.</p>\n<p>“All they want is their leaders to tell them, ‘If I make gestures to the Palestinians, am I more secure or am I more vulnerable?’ That’s all they care about,” Makovsky said. “I think they’d care less if some small settlements outside of Nablus stay exactly where they are.”</p>\n<p>According to Makovsky, there needs to be a distinction between ideology of safety and individual safety.</p>\n<p>“So, what you’d be doing is decoupling these two issues and signal a new direction — tell the Palestinians you want them to have their own space, but because the region is a meltdown, you’re not going to pull the army out,” Makovsky said.</p>\n<p>Julie Alexander, fourth-year psychology major who attended the talk, said she heard about the event through Facebook and was interested to hear from individuals who have played key roles in international policy.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the time, all we get is media coverage,” Alexander said. “To hear the reasons why from a source closer to the issue is a really special opportunity.”</p>\n<p>Kimberly Ruiz, fourth-year global studies major, said she believes discussing the Israel-Palestine conflict from a new perspective could lead to a solution.</p>\n<p>“The discussion has the possibility to bring out new ideas,” Ruiz said. “Shifting the way a problem is approached can make some change.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Feb. 25 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
