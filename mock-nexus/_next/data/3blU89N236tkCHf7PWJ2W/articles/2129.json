Legal Code, the governing document of all A.S. entities, requires executives to complete at least six units per quarter — making them at least a half-time student — during the spring quarter in which they are elected and each of the subsequent fall, winter and spring quarters of their term.</p>\n<p>The executives — current S.A.G. Grecia Martinez, former EVPSA Kristin Hsu, former President James Villarreal ‘16 and former EVPSA Melvin Singh ‘15 – either withdrew or canceled their enrollment or took fewer than the required number of units at some point during their terms, according to student enrollment records.</p>\n<p>A.S. Attorney General Zeina Safadi said she is currently investigating Martinez’s withdrawal from Fall Quarter 2018 to determine whether there is cause for a Judicial Council case. Martinez said she believes she did not violate any requirement.</p>\n<p>Martinez withdrew from Fall Quarter 2018, Hsu canceled her Spring Quarter 2018 and Villarreal dropped below half-time during Winter Quarter 2016. Singh canceled Winter Quarter 2015 and there is no record of him attending UCSB in Spring Quarter 2015.</p>\n<p>Last spring, former EVPSA-elect Mayela Morales was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualified</a> before being sworn in after it was discovered she had canceled her classes for the quarter, making her ineligible for her position.</p>\n<p>It is unclear if A.S. executives from previous years would have been allowed to serve if it came to light that they were taking fewer than six credits.</p>\n<p>Executive officers receive $3,000 per quarter – taken from student fees and paid directly to their BARC accounts — for serving the student body.</p>\n<p>Cindy Lopez, A.S. assistant director for finance and budget, confirmed that all executives who the <em>Nexus</em> found had withdrawn or canceled their enrollment or dropped below half-time over the last five years received their $3,000 stipends each quarter and that none had returned the money.</p>\n<p>Students who withdraw before the beginning of a quarter have their registration canceled and receive a full refund, the UCSB Office of the Registrar <a href=\"https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/registration-enrollment/registration-enrollment/withdraw-from-the-university\">website</a> says. It is unclear what Hsu and Singh, the executives who canceled their quarters, used the $3,000 for.</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez directed all questions regarding consequences for failing to meet eligibility requirements to Judicial Council.</p>\n<p>Raymond Alonso, who leads the Judicial Council, declined to comment.</p>\n<p>“What the Legal Code is missing are the consequences, if any, that come with not being enrolled as a student,” A.G. Safadi told the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Martinez withdrew on Dec. 7, the last day of instruction for Fall Quarter 2018. Hsu declined to comment. Singh and Villarreal did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>\n<p>Records also show that two other executives, former A.S. President Hieu Le ‘18 and former S.A.G. Josephine Ampaw ‘17, did not complete the minimum six units for their respective quarters.</p>\n<p>However, Le withdrew from Spring Quarter 2018 about six days after his term had ended and his successor, current A.S. President Brooke Kopel, had taken office. Le declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Ampaw retroactively withdrew from two of her classes after the end of Fall Quarter 2016, citing a personal family emergency and a desire to protect her GPA.</p>\n<p>“At the time that I was doing S.A.G., I was in those classes,” Ampaw said in an interview. “It’d be important to also state that regardless of a family emergency, I still worked as S.A.G., and I still served the student population.”</p>\n<p>Marquez said she had not been aware of the executives who had withdrawn or canceled their enrollment or taken fewer than six units until she was informed by the <em>Nexus</em>. She said executives may not have known they had dipped below the six-unit minimum and that she wished she had known so she and other A.S. staffers could have provided them with resources and support.</p>\n<p>Lopez and Marquez are responsible for checking executives’ enrollment status before paying them, but Legal Code does not require them to check their enrollment status throughout the year.</p>\n<p>A.S. senators, BCU officers and all other non-executives who are paid by the association have their enrollment checked at the end of each quarter, making it more likely that a change in enrollment status would be caught and their honoraria affected, Lopez said.</p>\n<p>The $3,000 stipend for executives — originally intended to cover all or part of tuition — is paid before each quarter starts, on Sept. 15, Dec. 15 and March 15 for fall, winter and spring quarters.</p>\n<p>Marquez said that her job is to check an executive’s enrollment before paying them, and “outside of that, I would imagine that it’s on them to report it or give it back.”</p>\n<p>S.A.G. Martinez, who withdrew from the university while serving during the Fall Quarter 2018 but is currently enrolled, maintained that she did not violate the Legal Code and said there is a “gray area” in the eligibility clause.</p>\n<p>She argued that since the clause for executives falls under the eligibility portion of Legal Code, the by-laws serve as expectations for candidates running for positions, not obligations to be upheld.</p>\n<p>“This is supported by the fact that the clauses included in those same sections are all worded in language concerning a candidate’s [eligibility] for an election,” she wrote in a message after her interview.</p>\n<p>Martinez said Legal Code should be clarified so that expectations and exceptions for executives are clearly outlined.</p>\n<p>If a Judicial Council case were filed against her, Martinez said it would “spark a bigger conversation about what should be done in special situations like this,” but she doesn’t believe it would be the right step.</p>\n<p>“I don’t believe I’m in violation,” Martinez said. “I mean, I was a student. I did my job and I was a student at the same time.”</p>\n<p>A full version of A.S. Legal Code can be viewed below.

The last time he pitched a full season was back in 2005, when he posted a 1.16 WHIP and a 3.48 ERA. Since then, he has not been able to log more than 99.1 innings in a season and has managed an ERA under four just once, when he pitched seven games for Boston in 2008. Maybe this is the second coming of Bartolo, but I think he is going to start to regress, and soon.</p>\n<p>Bud Norris, SP, Houston Astros: 2 wins, 3.16 ERA, 52 strikeouts</p>\n<p>This is only Norris’ third season in the majors, so he may be reaching his potential, but it just seems too drastically different from his previous two seasons, in which he posted very similar stats. His ERA is almost two runs lower than it was last season, and his 52 strikeouts put him on pace to far exceed the 158 he posted in 27 starts a year ago. Add that to a lower walk rate, and you get a player who seems to have reinvented himself in the course of one offseason. Like I said, he may have simply found his stride, but I would be very surprised if he didn’t end the season with an ERA a lot closer to four.</p>\n<p>Matt Joyce, OF, Tampa Bay Rays: .356 AVG, 3 HR, 14 RBI</p>\n<p>Joyce’s current stats are so out of line with what he posted in his previous three seasons that the only possible conclusion is that he is riding a very long hot streak. Joyce is a career .262 hitter and has never hit for an average higher than .252 before this season. Similarly, his current OPS (.956), slugging percentage (.554) and on-base percentage (.356) are much higher than anything he’s posted before. He’s due to come back down to earth soon, and the fall could hit owners who trusted him very hard indeed.</p>\n<p>Russell Martin, C, New York Yankees: .255 AVG, 6 HR, 20 RBI</p>\n<p>For those of you who picked Martin up when he was hitting over .300 and are holding on to him in case he brings his average back up, forget it. Martin has not hit over .250 since 2008. His on-base percentage (.358) is also settling into the area that it has been in for the last three seasons. The only thing that’s keeping him a viable option is his .500 slugging percentage, but that’s due to come down as well, as the last time he even slugged better than .400 was 2007.</p>\n<p>Daisuke Matsuzaka, SP, Boston Red Sox: 3 wins, 24 strikeouts, 4.64 ERA</p>\n<p>Daisuke has allowed two or fewer runs in four of his last five starts (though one of those was only one inning) and has started to walk fewer batters. However, he let up four runs in six innings in his last start and two runs in a one inning appearance against the Angels four days earlier. He has posted an ERA under 4.40 once in his career with the Red Sox, and I believe that his ERA will settle about where it is for the rest of the season. If you picked him up thinking that he was going to keep throwing gems like the one he threw against the Angels on April 23 or against the Blue Jays on April 18, you are out of luck.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus fantasy sports columnist Josh Greenberg likes lists.

He is the most athletic specimen the game has ever seen. At 6’ 8” and 270 pounds, he has the most unique blend of size, strength, speed, instincts and jaw-dropping athleticism to ever grace the court. His ability to play and guard 1 through 4 while demonstrating more consistent defensive intensity than Kobe also makes him much more versatile.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LeBron, at just 26 years of age, has played seven fewer seasons and roughly one-third the numbers of playoff games as Kobe. This is important to consider simply because he has had far less opportunities to make big shots, or shine in “clutch” situations as Kobe is so over-glorified for.</p>\n<p>Moreover, using the NBA’s measure of clutch play — the final five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime with a margin of five points or fewer — LeBron has again proved to be far more efficient than the Black Mamba in each of the last four seasons. Believe it or not, when Kobe is on the floor in crunch time, his Lakers are actually outscored by their opponents.</p>\n<p>In fact, LeBron has actually performed better than Kobe at the end of tight playoff games. Over the course of Kobe’s playoff career, he has connected on five of 20 attempts when having the opportunity to make a potential game-tying or go-ahead field goal in the final 10 seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime, (or 25 percent compared to the league average over the same time of 28 percent). Conversely, LBJ has made five of 12 of these same shots during his playoff career (41.7 percent).</p>\n<p>When the two have met head to head, it is yet another landslide victory for King James. James-led teams are 9-5 when meeting with Kobe’s, while playing most of those games on teams with far inferior talent. Bryant has also benefited from playing for the most decorated coach in NBA history. During that infamous 2004-05 season, with Coach Phil Jackson on vacation and Lamar Odom, Caron Butler and Chucky Atkins as his sidekicks, Kobe led his team to a miserable 34-48 record and an 11th place finish in the Western Conference.</p>\n<p>James, on a team with comparable talent in 2009, led Mo Williams, Zydrunas Ilgauskas and co. to 66 wins. Also intriguing, this season the Cavs, with a vast majority of their roster still intact, stumbled to a pathetic 19-63 record in their first year without King James — finishing dead last in the Eastern Conference.</p>\n<p>Hate him or love him, LeBron is the most dominant player in the game today. Though Bryant does have five titles to his name, we are not measuring who is the most decorated, but rather who is the best.
