Dangerous. Untamed.</p>\n<p>These are the common misconceptions about life here at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Overcoming, this false illusion has always been difficult, but the tragedy that occurred on May 23, 2014, was an unfortunate yet compelling reminder of the love and unity that reside within the UCSB community.</p>\n<p>Prior to this date, preparing to graduate from St. Mary’s High School in Stockton, Calif., and having already verbally committed to the UCSB men’s basketball team back in Aug. 2013, current junior shooting guard Gabe Vincent seemed to have everything figured out.</p>\n<p>But he, too, once shared uncertainty before this decision, yet his perspective was corrected as he was gradually integrated into the UCSB community.</p>\n<p>“When I was in high school and people would bring up [UCSB], it started to get a bad reputation. Everybody knew it was a party school, but that’s kind of a two-sided coin. People like to party and have fun and go to school, but some people are discouraged by that,” Vincent explained. “I for sure was at first. When you think of UCSB, most of the time that’s what you think of. Yes, you get a great education, but that party scene over there might be too wild. [But] the more I came out and got involved with the community and saw what they were about and got more comfortable here, [I saw] that people are in the library 24/7, people are grinding, taking classes, and that’s just a way for them to let loose. The community is so small that people are all together; it allows everyone to enjoy life together, which is awesome because not many places can have that.”</p>\n<p>As someone who had confirmed his love for basketball in the sixth grade and who was determined to put his all into the sport once he started playing at the AAU level, Vincent saw the advantages of UCSB’s location, beautiful women and Division I status, which seemed to provide an opportunity any prospective student-athlete would desire to seize.</p>\n<p>But the potential to be the university’s next star player with such incentives at his fingertips took a backseat during his realization of UCSB’s ability to bond and unite after the tragic loss of innocent lives just a year before his official enrollment at the school.</p>\n<p>“I came out here a lot, I took a few unofficial [visits] just to come see the guys practice. I had been out in I.V. and had seen that culture and kind of got accustomed to it to a point that it already felt like home. That was a big thing for me coming here because you have to be able to live somewhere when you’re not playing basketball, too,” Vincent said. “So when I heard the news about the shooting, that’s something that, even if you’re not attached to the school emotionally or physically, when you read that kind of tragedy, that hits your heart because that’s something that should never happen and is terrible to read or hear.”</p>\n<p>“When you are attached to it, like we are now, and I kind of was in a way then, it definitely hit home. It was sad to hear; I remember I came out the following weekend because I was coming up on another unofficial [visit] to see the guys practice, and even they were down,” Vincent said. “Looking out to the streets of I.V., they were dead quiet, nobody was out. The whole community was mourning what had happened. That was eye-opening because it’s not just everybody out here for themselves. Even though there are cliques or groups, we are still one strong community. The way people came together for that was inspiring.”</p>\n<p>Rather than be deterred from his choice to attend UCSB after such a horrific moment that made headlines nationwide, Vincent’s empathy influenced his newfound interpretation of such a unique community.</p>\n<p>The foundation for this compassion comes from Vincent’s parents, Cynthia and Franklyn, who are both psychologists. Once quoted saying his upbringing was “different,” Vincent holds a perspective of this three-year anniversary that only he can understand.</p>\n<p>“To me, honestly, psychology, even though there’s many facets of it, a lot of the times it’s just being able to read in-between the lines. A lot of people are going to put on a front or show this or that, but that might not be what they’re really feeling or showing,” Vincent said. “I think that plays a big role in terms of relating to people and being able to talk to them and gauge how a conversation will flow [to see if] they’re upset or figure out what they want to talk about; you can use [psychology] in so many different ways.”</p>\n<p>“Seeing the guys and the community in that way, you could see it was genuine grief. People were really going through it and it was a struggle for everyone. Naturally, when that happens, you start thinking about yourself and how you could’ve done better. Even though you might have not been directly in the situation, you start to think, ‘Man, I could have done that differently,’ and that could’ve changed somebody else’s life in a positive way.Unfortunately it had to happen in that way, but I think it was eye-opening and some people made some changes.”</p>\n<p>As a leader on this season’s team that included only one senior, the impact of the tragedy isn’t as evident. But, the fact that this year’s graduating class will be the last of the UCSB and Isla Vista communities that were in the areas during the incident is still very prevalent.</p>\n<p>“I think there has been an unbelievable amount of support, with the blue lights and the awareness around campus. But I feel like as one generation comes and goes and [with] this senior class being the last [group] that were really here for it, I think that plays a major role in it kind of [being] forgotten, which I hope it doesn’t because I hope that community can stay strong,” Vincent said. “A lot of universities have four years in, four years out, and it’s almost like a new culture or new tradition. I hope that’s something that can stay alive, and hopefully, through the different support systems on campus, they can keep the community strong together and let them know that things can happen, it doesn’t matter where you are. There’s been many other instances at universities, and I think that it’s important to not keep these things relevant but on your mind.”</p>\n<p>Whether or not time heals all wounds can only be determined by the individual. While the pain and disbelief of what took place on May 23, 2014, still causes grief for many, the recovery from this tragedy is still taking place and can be sustained with a communal effort.</p>\n<p>“I think Isla Vista is a special place. It’s right on the beach, it’s right next to campus. It’s a great diverse group, and I think it’s important to keep in mind, especially with this class leaving, and we have some younger guys on the team [who are like] ‘It’s the anniversary of what?’ and you can already kind of see it becoming forgotten,” Vincent said. “I don’t think it’s anything to run away from, the history of that [event], because you can’t change time. [Embracing] that and keeping the discussion open, be willing to talk about it and let people know what happened. Obviously you don’t want history to repeat itself; that’s the last thing this community could need or want.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78079\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/deeper-than-hoops-gabe-vincent-stands-with-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78079\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/deeper-than-hoops-gabe-vincent-stands-with-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/deeper-than-hoops-gabe-vincent-stands-with-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/deeper-than-hoops-gabe-vincent-stands-with-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-25/deeper-than-hoops-gabe-vincent-stands-with-ucsb/","id":1890,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1889,1888,1887],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White","biography":"Not available","articles":[163,251,282,290,292,293,300,302,311,312,314,315,316,327,328,329,337,338,340,341,343,345,347,349,350,351,353,356,357,361,362,363,364,365,368,370,372,373,375,376,379,381,382,385,387,389,391,392,393,395,396,398,401,406,407,408,414,426,447,452,453,455,468,471,487,488,492,504,506,507,513,517,528,529,530,583,585,601,674,975,1208,1363,1415,1428,1430,1443,1473,1775,1776,1777,1872,1873,1881,1886,1889,1890,1893,1908,1911,1914,1971,1974,1984,1993,2005,2020,2021,2025,2849,3280,3283,3284,3290,3298,3299,3304,3306,3310,3322,3323,3325,3338,3381,4102,4954,4981,4988,4991,4996,5041,5044,5049,5055,5070,5071,5072,5073,5074,5075,5076,5077,5079,5080,5081,5082,5088,5089,5097,5098,5120,5121,5151,5152,5317,5340,5342,5343,5345,5347,5349,5365,5367,5368,5369,5371,5384,5387,5388,5389,5390,5391,5393,5394,5395,5401,5479,5509,5543],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Ball Is Life.

However, various sports news leaders continue to give LaVar a platform to utilize. Whether it be him defending the $495 price tag of Lonzo’s signature shoe or him making comparisons to Steph Curry or LeBron James, headlines have constantly played into LaVar’s ploy.</p>\n<p>Quite honestly, the “Big Baller Brand” head honcho has done a good job of utilizing the exposure he has received. He’s been the mastermind of a publicity stunt that has enabled him to put the “BBB” brand on a pedestal that some support or hate.</p>\n<p>While the pricing for the “ZO2” signature shoe is too high, I respect the vision of the family business. The plan to invest in yourself is genius. Why not have complete creative control over how you mold and develop your own brand?</p>\n<p>Some may consider it costly considering that Nike, Under Armour and Adidas each decided not to sign Lonzo to a shoe deal. But self-investment is something no other player has done, with the closest being LeBron James and his lifetime deal with Nike.</p>\n<p>The vision is clear, but the logistics behind the brand will have to be altered in order for it to grow in the years to come. How to do so isn’t exactly clear at the moment due to the fact that Lonzo has yet to be drafted and even play a game in the NBA.</p>\n<p>After a decision that likely included the input of LaVar for Lonzo to not participate in the NBA Combine, it is no surprise that Lonzo will only work out for the Lakers prior to the NBA Draft.</p>\n<p>These are the circumstances that have left me with mixed emotions regarding LaVar’s role in Lonzo’s transition to the NBA.</p>\n<p>Although LaVar’s intentions surely aren’t meant to devalue his son’s talents, he has steadily added pressure to the already daunting expectations Lonzo is entering the league with, especially if he ends up going to the Lakers, who are looking to solidify a franchise player who will end their decline of the past three years.</p>\n<p>Still, it’s unfair that people make claims in hopes of Lonzo being a bust or having an underwhelming career due to the actions of his father. Many presume that Lonzo’s laidback demeanor is a sign of submissiveness to his father or that of a kid who never had any say regarding his basketball career.</p>\n<p>Whether that’s the case or not cannot be determined. Yet, in the meantime, the battle between LaVar Ball and naysayers can only be resolved in a matter of time.</p>\n<p>And that’s to allow Lonzo’s game to speak for itself.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77942\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/ball-is-life-but-could-lavar-be-detrimental-to-lonzos-nba-career/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77942\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/ball-is-life-but-could-lavar-be-detrimental-to-lonzos-nba-career/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/ball-is-life-but-could-lavar-be-detrimental-to-lonzos-nba-career/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/ball-is-life-but-could-lavar-be-detrimental-to-lonzos-nba-career/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/ball-is-life-but-could-lavar-be-detrimental-to-lonzos-nba-career/","id":1889,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1888,1887,1886],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Heir to the Throne: Why Giannis Will One Day Usurp LeBron","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-13-at-11.48.15-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-13-at-11.48.15-AM.png?resize=628%2C542&ssl=1","description":"With time comes new superstars.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Born on Dec. 6, 1994, Antetokounmpo was only 18 years old when he was drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks, making him the youngest in the 2013 NBA Draft.</p>\n<p>However, his rise to stardom started inside of Greece’s second division basketball league. Here he managed a 9.5 points and 5.0 rebounds per game average over 26 total games for Filathlitikos, which sparked conversation as his potential began to be noticed. Spanish clubs like Barcelona and Zaragoza then began to show their interest in him and touted his prodigious ability.</p>\n<p>Regardless, Antetokounmpo remained in Greece until the conclusion of the 2012-13 season. His next move was then perhaps the wisest decision of his life: become eligible for the NBA Draft. Then the rest was history.</p>\n<p>Well, not exactly history. Presently, Antetokounmpo is respected and perhaps even feared by his peers, but let’s look at the early moments of his professional career.</p>\n<p>Following his first round, No. 15 overall selection by the Bucks, Antetokounmpo gradually made an impact on the court. In his first three NBA seasons he averaged 12.1 points, 3.0 assists and 6.3 rebounds per game. Not particularly standout numbers, however, he earned enough accolades along the way to promote his projection toward greatness.</p>\n<p>In his rookie year, he totaled 61 blocks which led all rookies in the NBA, thus earning himself a spot on the All-Rookie Second Team roster. His physical prowess was first recognized during his sophomore season when he was invited to participate in the NBA Slam Dunk contest. Later that year, Antetokounmpo also helped his team achieve its first playoff win since its 2009-10 campaign. In just his third season, he etched himself into Milwaukee Bucks history with the most triple-doubles in a single season.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t look like he’s sweating or even breathing hard,” Bucks Head Coach Jason Kidd said when interviewed about Giannis’ play, “and that shows just how talented he really is.”</p>\n<p>Over the years, Giannis has received similar praise from his idols like Kobe Bryant and Allen Iverson; however, none as directly valuable as from the King himself: LeBron James.</p>\n<p>“A guy that can handle the ball at that size is special … at that speed, with his length. I think J-Kidd does a great job of placing him in the lineup where he sees a mismatch, and so he’s all over the floor.”</p>\n<p>This quote not only puts Antetokounmpo’s young and outstanding career into perspective, but also brings us to his comparisons with LeBron, currently the best player in the game.</p>\n<p>Yes, best player in the game. Sure he may not be in MVP contention amongst the names of Russell Westbrook and James Harden; but no one else can match LeBron’s level of speed and power. Well, perhaps Antetokounmpo will one day.</p>\n<p>In terms of this regular season’s production, the pair each had noteworthy seasons. LeBron averaged 26.4 points, 8.7 assists and 8.6 rebounds per game whereas Antetokounmpo maintained an average of 22.9 points, 5.4 assists and 8.7 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>The two also started side by side in the 2017 NBA All-Star Game as members of the first team roster. When the Cavaliers visited the Bucks back in November, Antetokounmpo led his team to a 118-101 victory after scoring a total of 34 points, 12 rebounds, five steals, five assists and two blocks all whilst being matched up with LeBron. The two later acknowledged each others efforts with a respectful post-game hug, but from watching that game one can tell how special Antetokounmpo will be.</p>\n<p>As for the remainder of Giannis’s season this year, he scored a career high of 41 points in a February game against the Lakers, became the youngest All-Star in franchise history and, most especially, led his team in all five of the major record categories: points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks.</p>\n<p>Altogether Antetokounmpo’s athletic skills and raw talent can only pose a resemblance to LeBron’s. Each player has a unique capacity to strike panic into opponents when they’re headed toward the rim with both size and speed.</p>\n<p>However, it can be understood that in both statistic and legacy, Antetokounmpo has a while to go before catching up to LeBron. Although, he still has plenty of time to do so as he’s only 22 years old.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 11, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77766\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/heir-to-the-throne-why-giannis-will-one-day-usurp-lebron/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77766\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/heir-to-the-throne-why-giannis-will-one-day-usurp-lebron/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/heir-to-the-throne-why-giannis-will-one-day-usurp-lebron/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/heir-to-the-throne-why-giannis-will-one-day-usurp-lebron/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/heir-to-the-throne-why-giannis-will-one-day-usurp-lebron/","id":1888,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1887,1886,1885],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Beyond the Shore: Taylor Helps Lead Best Buddies","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-05-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/WWaPo_vsCSUB-170305-DustinHarris-02-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/WWaPo_vsCSUB-170305-DustinHarris-02-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Taylor Shore has other best buddies beside her beloved sport of water polo.

It’s really fun and pretty easygoing, which is good for me especially because balancing school and water polo isn’t the easiest thing to do.”</p>\n<p>In the past, the club has gone to other places away from the campus, but this year they have tried to switch it up a little. No matter where they arrange these events, the connections are still refined.</p>\n<p>“I’ve made a lot of friends in the club and also with the individuals with disabilities, I feel like I developed some strong relationships with them too,” Shore said.<br>\nA four-year member now, Shore has been the vice president this past school year in which she displays her leadership skills that she brings out every day in practice at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p>“There’s a leadership aspect to [Best Buddies],” Shore said. “We have to coordinate with the board and things like that, so stepping up and doing different tasks is kind of similar as my role as captain.”</p>\n<p>Everyone’s aware of the wide range of life lessons that sports provide, but not everyone knows what it’s like to make a difference in the lives of individuals who are less fortunate.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really humbling experience and it shows you there’s more to the world than just water polo,” Shore said. “I’ve dedicated my life to water polo these past however many years, but it’s nice to get involved in other things and meet other people. It’s fun to be involved and make a difference in other people’s lives.”</p>\n<p>Complementing the Corona, the California native’s ability to collaborate and lead others was also influenced by her role in dealing with essentially a fresh team. Yet, she withstood the process of instilling the culture amongst a pool of many newcomers.</p>\n<p>This process occurred over the course of the entire season, whether it was just setting up the pool or going up against top-notch talent.</p>\n<p>“It didn’t turn out how we wanted it to which is kind of a bummer, but I just try to remind myself of the journey,” Shore said.</p>\n<p>Taylor Shore’s water polo journey began when she was just nine years old. She was almost destined to play the sport considering her family’s history with it.</p>\n<p>“My dad played [water polo] when he was younger and my mom swam, so aquatics have been in my family for the longest time,” Shore said. “Both my brothers played [water polo] and I have cousins and uncles that coach, so it’s a big part of my family.”</p>\n<p>Water polo was love at first sight for the crafty do-it-all Gaucho. Her admiration and dedication helped her achieve the goal of playing in college.</p>\n<p>“I just remember day one falling in love with [water polo], and I’ve always been passionate about it,” Shore said. “Playing in college was always something I wanted to do; it was one of my goals for a really long time.”</p>\n<p>Shore brought her competitiveness that she learned from growing up with her two brothers to UCSB where she excelled.</p>\n<p>Even with the prominent role of captaining a young team on her shoulders, the team captain didn’t sink.</p>\n<p>In her final season, Shore also led the team in points, steals and earned ejections. UCSB was 8-0 this year in games where Shore scored a hat trick.</p>\n<p>While her days of scoring in a UCSB cap and suit uniform have come to an end, Shore’s philanthropic endeavors do not end as her collegiate career prepares to conclude.</p>\n<p>Shore’s passion for helping people with developmental and intellectual disabilities will not stop here.</p>\n<p>“I got a job recently at a place called PathPoint,” Shore said. “What we do there is kind of similar but a little different. I would work with adults with disabilities and help them develop life skills or find jobs or teach them how to pay their bills and things like that. I‘m going to do that over summer.”</p>\n<p>However, she still isn’t done with water polo. After working over the summer, Shore plans on testing the professional waters overseas.</p>\n<p>“Come the end of September, I want to go play abroad because I don’t think I’m ready to be done with water polo yet, so I want to go play in Spain for nine months and then come back,” Shore said.</p>\n<p>Very few players in UCSB women’s water polo history can match up with the career thatShore put together.</p>\n<p>From winning the program’s first-ever Big West Tournament championship to leading a young group of players a year later, Shore has been a role model while laying the groundwork for the future of UCSB women’s water polo.</p>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77620\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/beyond-the-shore-taylor-helps-best-buddies/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77620\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/beyond-the-shore-taylor-helps-best-buddies/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/beyond-the-shore-taylor-helps-best-buddies/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/beyond-the-shore-taylor-helps-best-buddies/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/beyond-the-shore-taylor-helps-best-buddies/","id":1887,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[1886,1885,1884],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
