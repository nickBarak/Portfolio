program was created in hopes of fostering higher retention rates for transfer students beyond their first year at UCSB.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UC Santa Barbara’s Educational Opportunity Program launched the Summer Transfer Transition Program, a project designed to smoothen the transition for transfer students starting at UCSB, for the first time this summer.</p>\n<p>The three-day “bridge” program – focused on helping transfer students with the transition to a new college – was offered to Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) students during the last week in August.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the three days, students learned about several campus resources, such as the Office of Financial Aid, as well as leadership opportunities and the different major departments around campus.</p>\n<p>The program was created in hopes of fostering higher retention rates for transfer students beyond their first year at UCSB, according to Angelica Caudillo, a Counselor for Student Transfer Services, and Brenda Curiel, EOP’s Assistant Director.</p>\n<p>“Transfer students face a multitude of challenges once they transfer to a 4 year institution,” Caudillo and Curiel said in a joint email.</p>\n<p>“[Challenges include] adjusting to the campus, transitioning from semester to quarter system, financial aid support, obtaining a sense of community [and] getting connected with campus resources.”</p>\n<p>In 2016, the first year transfer retention rate was 92.7 percent, according to <a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/ug-outcomes\">UC Undergraduate Graduation Rates</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe style=\"width: 830px; min-height: 530px;

of the Univerity of California Office of the President. <em>Hayley Tice / Daily Nexus</em></h6>\n<p>The percentage of transfer students who were accepted into UCSB has increased in recent years, jumping from 51.6 percent for the 2016- 2017 school year to 55.7 percent for the 2017-2018 school year, according to <a href=\"http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/campus.profiles/campus.profiles.2017.18.pdf\">UCSB’s Campus Profile.</a></p>\n<p>The creation of Summer Transfer Tradition Program (STTP) was in part a response to this growing demographic.</p>\n<p>“The goal of the EOP Summer Transfer Transition Program is to retain transfer students… and build a sense of community, and support their academic and overall success at UCSB,” Caudillo and Curiel said.</p>\n<p>Several on-campus departments, including the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, Tropicana Housing and the College of Letters and Science, aided EOP in the development of the program.</p>\n<p>“EOP focused in a holistic approach for the entirety of the summer program,” Caudillo and Curiel said.</p>\n<p>According to the EOP Website, the EOP office <a href=\"http://eop.sa.ucsb.edu/about-us\">strives</a> to immerse “income eligible and first-generation undergraduates” within campus life to help them thrive both academically and socially, and as a result, to prepare them to find jobs in their respective fields following graduation.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SB-320-veto.pdf\">veto message</a>.</p>\n<p>However, he added that because the average distance to abortion providers in campus communities is five to seven miles, as stated in a study sponsored by the SB320 supporters, the bill is “not necessary.”</p>\n<p>California Senator Connie Leyva originally introduced <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB320\">SB 320</a> in Feb. 2017. The bill passed its final vote in the California State Senate on Aug. 30, 2018.</p>\n<p>The bill would have required all University of California and California State University campuses to offer the pills by Jan. 1, 2022, including UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“It is the intent of the Legislature that public university student health centers make abortion by medication techniques as accessible and cost-effective for students as possible, and thus public university student health centers should treat abortion by medication techniques as a basic health service,” according to the bill’s text.</p>\n<p>The<em> Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/abortion-pill-clears-hurdle-on-path-to-public-universities/#search\">previously reported</a> that The National Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), a non-partisan council, released a report on March 16 that confirmed that the Mifeprex pill is safe and effective.</p>\n<p>Support for this bill came largely from the Women’s Foundation and the Tara Health Foundation. The two foundations <a href=\"http://justcarecalifornia.org/press/national-academies-of-sciences-report-on-abortion-context-experts-on-sb-320/\">helped fund</a> the implementation of SB 320 into public universities.</p>\n<p>“We are disappointed that Gov. Brown failed to support what the Senate, the Assembly, and 6 in 10 Californians already have recognized in this groundbreaking bill — that students of California need abortion care on campus,” Surina Khan, the CEO of The Women’s Foundation of California, said in a <a href=\"https://womensfoundca.org/news/governor-brown-vetoes-campus-abortion-bill/\">press release</a>.</p>\n<p>“We choose to listen to students, not those in power who continually deny their reproductive rights. We deserve a system that works for the student[s] of California.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

id=\"caption-attachment-83206\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">TAMID held its inaugural TAMID Tank event at UCSB on May 9. <em>Courtesy of Mordi Shadpour</em></p></div>\n<p>TAMID held their first TAMID Tank May 9 in the Corwin Pavilion, which had a similar format to that of the ABC television show, “Shark Tank.” The developers of the startups presented their projects in front of three judges, who were all experienced venture capitalists.</p>\n<p>The first TAMID Tank was held three years ago at Queens College in New York City by several TAMID chapters, according to Mordi Shadpour, a second-year philosophy and linguistics double major and president of the UCSB chapter of TAMID.</p>\n<p>Other TAMID chapters have since gone on to host TAMID Tanks as well, such as the chapters in USC and the University of Miami.</p>\n<p>“This kind of event gives students a chance to pitch in front of all of their friends and get access to actual investors, which is hard for students like us to get,” Shadpour said. “It also inspires other students to go out there and make something out of their own ideas.”</p>\n<p>Shadpour, along with other members of the UCSB TAMID chapter, began working on the logistics and funding of putting on TAMID Tank at UCSB during Fall Quarter 2017.</p>\n<p>They also began spreading word of the application process through several ways, such as informing the UCSB professional fraternities, associations and societies on campus, making pitches in Technology Management Program classes, sending out emails to various departments and paying for Facebook ads.</p>\n<p>From the initial 40 applications that TAMID received, about five to 10 were dropped early in the process due to them being either non serious or incomplete, according to Shadpour. The remaining applications were then scrutinized, with interviews of the applicants being conducted throughout winter and spring quarters.</p>\n<p>“We then passed all that info to the CEOs and co-founders of this company called Social Native. My brother is one of the CEOs and his partner was a judge at the USC chapter’s TAMID Tank, so we felt they could help us with this and they went ahead and chose the three for us. Obviously no names of the applicants were involved to bias the process,” Shadpour said.</p>\n<p>The three finalists included Garpie, an on-foot navigation service that allows users to easily and privately locate and meet with up with their friends in real time; Nectir, an education app that better facilitates classroom participation and study groups; and Crypto For Charity, a service that allows for direct donations of digital currencies to charities.</p>\n<p>At the end of the event, the three judges chose Garpie as the winner of the competition.</p>\n<p>“When we won, it kind of showed that it wasn’t just us thinking that this was a good idea, but also that the public really does like it as well,” said Isaac Golberg, a third-year financial mathematics and statistics major and the vice president of strategic development of Garpie.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83207\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83207\" data-attachment-id=\"83207\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-21/on-foot-navigation-app-wins-new-venture-competition/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83207\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83207\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The three judges chose Garpie as the winner of the competition. <em>Courtesy of Mordi Shadpour</em></p></div>\n<p>Golberg said that the win meant a lot to him, as he and the team behind the project put their “blood, sweat, and tears” into Garpie and have “become really one with the product.”</p>\n<p>“The feedback I got from after the event from people was just incredible. Having people come up to me and say things like, ‘This is exactly what I need,’ and, ‘I need this now,’ was incredible to hear,” Golberg said.</p>\n<p>Golberg said what he believed sold the judges on Garpie was the increased accuracy of the geolocation services that the application has, which allows users to precisely locate their friends even in large crowds or huge spaces.</p>\n<p>“Garpie is significantly more accurate than anything on the market right now,” Golberg said. “When you’re using Google Maps or any other big navigation service, they can have up to a 50-foot discrepancy. When it comes to Garpie, it has about a two-to-five-foot accuracy.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Golberg said this increased accuracy also allows for the usage of an augmented reality feature within the app.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With Garpie, the augmented reality comes into play with the camera view,” Golberg said. “When you see your friend on a map and you try to go to them, once you start getting close to their location, you can turn on your camera view, as if you were taking a picture, and a virtual marker is displayed above the person’s head. This virtual marker can be an emoji or any virtual content that you want.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you’re in a crowded space like a music festival, that 50 foot discrepancy I mentioned earlier in other services doesn’t help you locate your friend with the virtual marker at all. You need that marker right above your friend’s head,” he explained.</span></p>\n<p>Golberg plans on using the $2,300 cash prize money on travel expenses incurred when meeting with investors in order to raise the seed money needed to get Garpie out into the market by the end of the summer.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been able to accomplish something that nobody else has been able to do,” Golberg said. “The fact is that these major companies, like Apple, Google and Snapchat, would love to optimize their geolocation services … and they have the vast resources to do it, but they haven’t been able to figure out how to do it. So the fact that we have been able to get around this obstacle shows the appeal behind the product.”</p>\n<p>Golberg said that the app is currently in alpha testing while further refinements are made to Garpie, but said that beta testing will soon commence.</p>\n<p>“There will definitely be people on campus testing it,” Golberg said. “After [the beta] cycle we’ll move into our full launch.”</p>\n<p>Shadpour was pleased with the initial response and ultimate turnout to the event. He said several professional groups he approached were enthusiastic about TAMID and sent many of their members to the event.</p>\n<p>“I thought there would be about 330 people who would come, so we only put 330 seats out … There were a lot of people standing in the back. It looked like ultimately there was about 400 people who came throughout the night,” Shadpour said.</p>\n<p>Shadpour said that the event went “amazing” and the highlight of the night for him was just seeing all the people in the back “supporting the students and coming to check out TAMID.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83204\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-21/on-foot-navigation-app-wins-new-venture-competition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83204\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-21/on-foot-navigation-app-wins-new-venture-competition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-21/on-foot-navigation-app-wins-new-venture-competition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-21/on-foot-navigation-app-wins-new-venture-competition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-21/on-foot-navigation-app-wins-new-venture-competition/","id":2238,"author":{"id":75,"name":"Eric Moon"},"related":[2237,2236,2235],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Petitions Regarding A.S.

Elections Board</em>, co-authored by UCSB 2018 graduate and former Isla Vista Party (IVP) head Nawar Nemeh and Morales, asks the Council to reconsider Morales’ disqualification as External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA).</p>\n<p>The second case, <em>Nemeh</em> v. <em>Campus United</em>, alleges that Campus United (CU) “engaged in slander” of IVP during the election. Nemeh asks that the Council remove all senators and executives who ran with CU from their current positions.</p>\n<p>The Council initially dismissed the latter case. Nemeh then filed a motion to reconsider the case, according to documents obtained by the Nexus from an anonymous source.</p>\n<p>However, the Council lost its quorum just before the 2017-2018 school year ended, leading to a paralyzing situation: Nemeh’s motion and the disqualification case cannot currently be ruled on due to the unprecedented number of vacancies.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Brooke Kopel <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/judicial-council-slots-remain-unfilled-as-senate-postpones-chair-vote/\">must make four appointments to the Council</a> before they are able to return to regular precedings. Until this occurs, these cases will remain in stasis.</p>\n<p><em>NEMEH AND MORALES </em>V.<em> ELECTIONS BOARD</em></p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Board disqualified Morales from the position of EVPSA in May when it was discovered she was not enrolled in school during spring quarter.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Legal Code, an executive candidate must be enrolled in at least six units per quarter to be eligible for office.</p>\n<p>Morales gave no comment at the time of her disqualification in mid-May.</p>\n<p>In the petition, Morales and Nemeh request that the Council overrule the disqualification and “investigate the reasoning behind the Elections Board scrutinizing the registration status of Mayela as opposed to all candidates on the ballot.”</p>\n<p>According to the petition, she challenged her academic standing with UCSB on the grounds that she had a personal emergency that required her to leave Isla Vista for a period of time.</p>\n<p>Morales and Nemeh argue the disqualification was in “blatant violation” of elections code because the board had not informed Morales of its decision soon enough.</p>\n<p>They also claim there was a partisan bias in place, calling the fact that the Board choose to focus on Morales rather than another candidate, a “peculiarity.”</p>\n<p>“The A.S. Elections Board has shown a deep disrespect for Mayela’s person, the Isla Vista Party, and the voters on campus who overwhelmingly chose her as their next External Vice President of Statewide Affairs,” the petition states.</p>\n<p>The Elections Board is currently holding a special election for the EVPSA position. However, if the Council rules in favor of Nemeh and Morales, Morales could be reinstated in her position, causing the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/madeline-loudon-is-sole-declared-candidate-for-evpsa-special-election/\">special election</a> results to become void.</p>\n<p><em>NEMEH </em>V. <em>CAMPUS UNITED</em></p>\n<p>In the petition, Nemeh alleges that CU was able to “improperly influence” the spring quarter election results through, among other matters, “engaging in slander” regarding IVP.</p>\n<p>The Nexus first heard of these allegations in mid-May and saw the evidence referenced in the case through an anonymous submitter.
