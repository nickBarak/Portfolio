Rob Romero, one of six officers who aided UCLA Police following the shooting there, spoke with UCSB students at a Pizza with Police event in February. <em>Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Less than 24 hours after a former UCLA student shot his former professor and himself on the Bruins’ campus, six members of the UC Santa Barbara Police Department arrived in Los Angeles to assist local officers.</p>\n<p>Along with officers from UC Irvine and UC Riverside, UCSB Police (UCPD) provided security and responded to calls on Thursday and Friday while the campus struggled to find normalcy in the last week before final exams.</p>\n<p>The six UCPD sergeants and detectives initially left Santa Barbara on Wednesday, the day of the shooting, but UCLA asked them to hold off as the campus was already flooded with 200 officers from the FBI, LAPD, Santa Monica Police Department and more.</p>\n<p>At 2 a.m. on Thursday, Sgt. Rob Romero and five others again prepared for the 100-mile drive to Los Angeles, arriving later that morning.</p>\n<p>Because of the uneasiness on campus, UCPD officers provided security for several events that would not usually require a police presence, Romero said. They also responded to emergency calls, freeing up UCLA officers who Romero said “are really wrapped up in the investigation” of the gunman.</p>\n<p>“We’re here to show the community at UCLA that you’re safe,” Romero said by phone from UCLA on Thursday. “We’re here to listen, to give hugs, sometimes just to talk to people about what happened.”</p>\n<p>The UCPD officers returned to UCSB late Friday night, but are “ready to redeploy if needed,” Romero said in an email.</p>\n<p>In addition to assisting at UCLA, university police are increasing their presence at UCSB as well.</p>\n<p>“I also understand and expect that these tragic events can also have an impact on our own campus and so I have increased the law enforcement presence, accordingly,” UCPD Chief Dustin Olson said in an email.</p>\n<p>Katya Armistead, the dean of student life, said there would be more officers on campus until after graduation ceremonies next weekend, noting that she had seen UCPD vehicles parked near Henley Gate and the University Plaza.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71663\" style=\"width: 233px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71663\"

a little bit safer,” she said. “If anybody’s thinking about messing with anything, we’re here.”</p>\n<p>Aside from the increase in police, UCSB Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) has updated its <a href=\"http://caps.sa.ucsb.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> with resources and is ready for students who seek help following the UCLA shooting.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t seen any notable increase right now, but we’ll have to see over the coming days,” Dr. Janet Osimo, a psychologist at CAPS, said.</p>\n<p>“It’s not uncommon for this kind of thing to reactivate people who were here during the Isla Vista tragedy,” Osimo said, referring to the 2014 shooting that left six UCSB students dead. “They might not be feeling safe and be scared and uncertain … that’s a pretty common response.”</p>\n<p>Osimo said people should take special care to get adequate rest, eat well, and give themselves “permission to feel different, because that’s a really common reaction.”</p>\n<p>On Twitter, many students from UC schools showed support for UCLA students by using the hashtag, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/weareoneuc\" target=\"_blank\">#WeAreOneUC</a>, which also surfaced on Twitter after the Isla Vista shooting in 2014.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

Gov Gavin Newsom proposed a 14-point plan to aid student-athletes academically.</p></div>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara attained a student-athlete graduation success rate of 82 percent in the 2014-2015 school year, according to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) website. The graduation success rate takes into account student-athletes who leave UCSB in good standing or graduate elsewhere.</p>\n<p>UCSB already has many of the policies called for in Newsom’s proposal, which would require that athletes who sustain career-ending injuries be able to retain their scholarships until graduation.</p>\n<p>The plan would also prevent coaches from having the authority to deny or admit student-athletes and limit practice time to no more than 20 hours a week.</p>\n<p>Additionally, administrations on UC campuses would have increased involvement in athletic departments and student-athletes would be required to meet with academic counselors regularly if the plan passes.</p>\n<p>Bill Mahoney, UCSB associate athletics director of communications, said each team decides if student-athletes keep their scholarships after sustaining career-ending injuries. He said the UCSB athletics department does not currently mandate this decision for all teams.</p>\n<p>Mahoney also said UCSB coaches have no say in admissions decisions for student-athletes. Freshman student-athletes are required to meet with academic counselors and each team requires its student-athletes to attend study halls on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>The athletics department abides by the NCAA rule limiting team practices to a maximum of 20 hours per week, according to Mahoney. Practices can exceed this limit, he said, only when school is not in session.</p>\n<p>While he recognized that many UC campuses are currently implementing many of the proposed policies, Newsom said the UC system should “lead the nation in reform” with his 14-point plan.</p>\n<p>“A lot of this is already being done, so it’s nice to codify it,” Newsom said.<br>\nGabe Vincent, a guard on UCSB’s basketball team and second-year religious studies major, said he and other student-athletes struggle to balance school and sports despite many of these policies aimed at upholding athletes’ academic performance.</p>\n<p>Vincent said he often worries that he will not graduate in four years, especially since he feels forced by his schedule to take only 12 or 13 units each quarter.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s definitely a worry,” Vincent said. “You’re expected to put the same amount of work and same amount of time [into school], but there’s a big block of your day that’s just taken out.”</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-70910\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB will create 300 more triple dormitories this fall by converting existing rooms in eight of its residence halls.</p>\n<p>Over 98 percent of current freshmen live in residence halls, and the university hopes to make more housing available for all students as part of an <a href=\"http://ucop.edu/student-housing-initiative/\">initiative</a> authored by the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) in January.</p>\n<p>This year, all continuing students were able to apply for residency in Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, San Miguel and San Nicholas halls, which have traditionally housed freshman students. The five residence halls, along with Manzanita Village and Santa Catalina Hall will be increasing the amount of triple rooms for the next academic year.</p>\n<p>According to the UCSB residence hall contract for the upcoming academic year, Santa Catalina Hall will convert the highest number of rooms, beginning fall 2016 with 975 students living in triples. Santa Catalina Hall currently has 157 triple spaces, according to Mario Muñoz, associate director of Resident Placement &amp; Assignment Services.</p>\n<p>During a UC Regents meeting on Tuesday, chief financial officer Nathan Brostrom presented strategies to expedite the development of student housing, mentioning UCSB’s increased triples as an example of a campus-specific housing solution.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s enrollment has decreased after hitting its peak in 2014, students in an undergraduate population of 20,607 still struggle to find housing on campus and in Isla Vista. According to the report, over 500 students are on UCSB’s housing waitlist, with almost 15,000 students on waitlists UC-wide.</p>\n<p>UCOP’s housing initiative aims to introduce 14,000 new beds across all UC campuses by 2020 and approximately 3,800 spaces have been created since January.</p>\n<p>“The UC has housed over 34,000 students in the past year,” Bergstrom said, “Given the size and scope of this initiative, there is no one-size-fits-all model.”</p>\n<p>Nivi Lakshminarayanan, incoming first-year pre-psychology and brain sciences major, selected her first choices for housing as Santa Cruz and Anacapa Hall.</p>\n<p>“I think it’ll definitely be different, since right now I just live in my own room at my house,” she said. “I always imagined living in a double whenever I thought of college so this is definitely a change.”</p>\n<p>Many freshmen, such as Thomas Crimmel, incoming first-year geography major, select their housing based on affordability.</p>\n<p>“I was originally considering a double, but the extra 2,000 dollars a year that came along with that double definitely encouraged me to seek out a third roommate.”</p>\n<p>Housing contracts for continuing students were due in early February, and Housing &amp; Residential Services will begin deciding spaces for students who have enrolled after the freshman contract deadline on May 15.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
