Plous Award by the College of Letters and Sciences for his outstanding performance as a junior faculty member.</p>\n<p>The Plous Award is one of the university’s oldest and most prestigious honors, established in 1957 in honor of assistant professor of economics Harold J. Plous who died at 32 years old after only three years in the position. The award is given to new and junior faculty members early in their careers with the university.</p>\n<p>Janowicz, who received recognition for his research in the geographic information science and “geoinformatics” fields, is scheduled to give the annual Harold J. Plous lecture next Spring as part of his appointment.</p>\n<p>Dean of Science and professor of physics Pierre Wiltzius said he believes Janowicz has been an impressive junior scholar from the start of his career at the university several years ago.</p>\n<p>“He has been with us now maybe for something like two years, and I was actually part of helping recruit him with the geography department,” Wiltzius said.</p>\n<p>“Among a very strong competitive pool of candidates he was the strongest already, so we were very lucky to be able to attract him in a very important area of geography.”</p>\n<p>According to geography professor Dar Roberts, Janowicz’s work in mobile computing and GPS based location services is especially relevant today.</p>\n<p>“The growing way we use smart phones, tablets or other devices to navigate our cars, find good restaurants, stores that sell specialized items, or simply look for things in geographic space,” Roberts said. “You can easily imagine that research that makes this easier and more accurate is of high interest.”</p>\n<p>Professor and chair of geography Dan Montello said the Plous Award demonstrates more than creative work and research.</p>\n<p>“I would emphasize that this is not only about being a talented junior professor, but it’s about already getting involved in campus life,” Montello said. “And that means intellectual activity both within your department and outside your department, I think those are important criteria.”</p>\n<p>According to Montello, starting this year Janowicz will chair the Cognitive Science Program, a position usually filled by a tenured professor instead of a junior professor, which is not a tenured position. The program gives graduate students the option of adding a Ph.D. emphasis in cognitive science.</p>\n<p>Wiltzius said the department is honored to have such a distinguished colleague as Janowicz.</p>\n<p>“We’re very proud that one of the members of the science division won this very prestigious prize. I couldn’t be happier for Janowicz and also for the Department of Geography, which is a highly ranked department,” Wiltzius said. “It’s one of the highest ranking geography departments of the country.”</p>\n<p>According to Wiltzius, Janowicz’s studies center around Geographic Information Science.</p>\n<p>“[GIS] is how we deal with all the information that relates one way or another to geography,” Wiltzius said. “The big data bases, all the information that comes from sensors whether they are terrestrial, satellite or airplane based. It’s a rapidly growing area that’s a little bit between geography and computer science, so it’s really a very exciting area that our geography department wants to be in.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version

Students’ Womxn’s Commission will be hosting its annual Womxn of Color Conference this Saturday, Feb. 3, honoring self-identifying women of color while bringing awareness to their intersectional struggles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The conference will be composed of workshops, speakers and free meals and it will last from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Workshops will address issues such as navigating what it means to be a minority womxn and promoting self-love.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be the conference’s sixth consecutive year at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zahira Kelly-Cabrera, an AfroDominicana writer, artist and international speaker, will kick off the conference by speaking about white-supremacist capitalist heteropatriarchy and what it means to minority women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kelly-Cabrera is an award-winning sociocultural critic who specifically focuses on the AfroLatina sector of intersectional feminism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her work has been featured in publications such as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New York Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cosmopolitan</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Kelly-Cabrera has also held lectures and panels at universities such as New York University and has hosted a TEDx talk in Mexico. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Members of the Womxn’s Commission executive board anticipate that her appearance will be a noteworthy way to begin the conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our keynote speaker is a badass, and I’m sure after hearing her speak we will all be pumped up and ready to get the day started,” third-year political science and art double major Siboney Arias, a Herstorian on the board, said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kelly-Cabrera’s speech will be followed by two workshop sessions and a caucus space. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Session A and B will each have nine workshops that cater to every self-identifying attendees through specialized topics, including self-love/care, white supremacy and intercultural struggles of colored women.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other workshops are aimed at building skill through career identity and vision building, such as the “Discovering my Career Identity” workshop, presented by a speaker named Monique. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KCSB will be also be hosting its own “Herstories” through a music workshop, during which Radio Xicana will give tips on how to use the radio as a platform for women of color.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People should look forward to meeting some powerful and strong womxn that take shit from no one. They should look forward to learning about different issues that they aren’t familiar with,” Arias said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caucus spaces will succeed the workshops and serve as a time to debrief and intermingle with individuals of shared identities, according to Arias.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many workshops are open to all, but some spaces specify the identifications they are open to. The Womxn of Color Conference website explains the status of each event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Womxns’ Commission reminds interested individuals to register online to ensure plenty of food and t-shirts for everyone. Attendees will be provided breakfast, lunch and dinner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am passionate about creating spaces for people to learn, grow, and feel safe. It’s very important to me to have people feel like they can be themselves, without feeling societies stigmas, so that was what I aimed for in this conference,” Arias said in an email.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80766\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-02/zahira-kelly-cabrera-to-speak-at-womxn-of-color-conference-2018/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80766\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-02/zahira-kelly-cabrera-to-speak-at-womxn-of-color-conference-2018/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-02/zahira-kelly-cabrera-to-speak-at-womxn-of-color-conference-2018/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-02/zahira-kelly-cabrera-to-speak-at-womxn-of-color-conference-2018/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-02/zahira-kelly-cabrera-to-speak-at-womxn-of-color-conference-2018/","id":2339,"author":{"id":207,"name":"Jasmine Moreno"},"related":[2338,2337,2336],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senators Sophia Dycaico and Brooke Kopel authored the resolution, and Brant and fellow Lobby Corps member Madeline Loudon student-sponsored the resolution.</p>\n<p>In January, students across the UC system traveled to the UC regents meeting to protest the proposed tuition hike. Brandt and several other UCSB students were present when the regents voted to postpone the vote until May.</p>\n<p>“A lot of regents were convinced that the UC should lobby the state for more funding before raising the tuition, so we’re at a really important opportunity where we could actually get more funding from the state,” Dycaico said. “That could stop the tuition hike.”</p>\n<p>According to the resolution, the cost of college has risen “dramatically” over the past 30 years, “outpacing the cost of medical care, real estate, child care and household appliances” and “forcing 55% of UC students to take on thousands of dollars in loans.”</p>\n<p>“Tuition is — if not the number one problem — one of the largest problems that students face,” Kopel said.</p>\n<p>She added that “college is already too expensive” and said that the resolution will help pressure the UC Regents and Governor Brown to stop the tuition hikes and to create a federal budget that works in the students’ interests.</p>\n<p>According to the resolution, the California governor’s 2018-2019 budget proposal does not including “adequate funding” for enrollment growth, psychological counselors, facility maintenance, student resources, health services, research equipment, academic tutoring and other needs.</p>\n<p>The UC receives the “same inflation-adjusted amount of funding from the State of California than it did in 2000, despite enrolling 90,000 more students in 2017 than it did in 2000,” the resolution states.</p>\n<p>The resolution calls for the California State Assembly, the California State Senate and the Governor of California to appropriate $10 million in funding to support the costs of education for an additional 2,500 students that the UC is required to enroll next year.</p>\n<p>Also requested are $35 million for “instruction and research facilities maintenance projects” and $71 million to supplement the proposition tuition and fee increase.</p>\n<p>Brandt said that proposed funding numbers in the resolution came from a 2018-2019 UC budget request submitted in February.</p>\n<p>The request states that funding is needed for “urgent projects” on campus, including fixing classrooms and updating labs. The university is also requesting funds to help deal with larger class sizes, the student to faculty ratio and increased demand on student services.</p>\n<p>“The investment will fund improvements to ensure student success and timely graduation,” the request states.</p>\n<p>The UC’s backlog exceeds $4 billion and is the third largest among all state agencies, according to the request.</p>\n<p>With the passing of the resolution, “We’re going to be doing a lot more in terms of letter writing, postcard writing, making calls. We’re definitely going to include in [the letters] that our campus stands behind these asks,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 5 of the Feb. 22, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

students walked out of class on Monday afternoon in support of undocumented students, urging for immigration reform within the United States and for better resources for undocumented individuals at UCSB.</p>\n<p>The protest, organized by UCSB’s Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success (I.D.E.A.S.), began at Storke Tower. Students and faculty members then marched through the Arbor walkway to Cheadle Hall, where they briefly walked inside before gathering outside of the building.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day [DREAMERS] are in a prison. We’re in a system that doesn’t allow us to fully exercise our rights and benefit from the things we deserve,” third-year Chicanx studies major Jose Sanchez said.</p>\n<p>“I am very proud of our students and community today,” Office of Student Life Associate Director Danielle Quinones said in an email.</p>\n<p>She explained that she originally asked students not to enter Cheadle Hall because of the “safety of the participants” due to the building’s “compact” corridors, but later was “proud to hear their voices echo throughout the building.”</p>\n<p>Protesters chanted several phrases while marching, including, “Undocumented, unafraid,” “Education, not deportation,” “No ban, no wall, sanctuary for all,” “The people united will never be divided” and “Ain’t no power like the power of the people, because the power of the people don’t stop.”</p>\n<p>“I thought I was always part of the same society, but then you realize when you go to school that you don’t have healthcare, you don’t have Medicaid, [and] if queer people get HIV you don’t get money for that either,” Sanchez said.</p>\n<p>Protesters also created several signs for the protest, some of which read, “Keep families together,” “No borders, no walls, #end I.C.E.,” “Borders are a lie,” “Here to stay” and “Education not deportation.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_81771\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81771\" data-attachment-id=\"81771\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-05/ucsb-students-faculty-protest-for-immigration-reform/ucsb-students-protests-against-trump-administrations-immigrant-policy-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ImmigrationProtest-030518-SichengWang-2-copy.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1366\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"UCSB Students protests against Trump Administration’s immigrant policy\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ImmigrationProtest-030518-SichengWang-2-copy.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ImmigrationProtest-030518-SichengWang-2-copy.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-81771 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ImmigrationProtest-030518-SichengWang-2-copy.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ImmigrationProtest-030518-SichengWang-2-copy.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ImmigrationProtest-030518-SichengWang-2-copy.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ImmigrationProtest-030518-SichengWang-2-copy.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ImmigrationProtest-030518-SichengWang-2-copy.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ImmigrationProtest-030518-SichengWang-2-copy.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-81771\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Protesters marched through the Arbor walkway on their way to Cheadle Hall. <em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was scheduled for termination on Monday, but a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/supreme-court-declines-trumps-appeal-to-review-federal-daca-court-case/\">Supreme Court ruling</a> in late February ensured that current DACA recipients can continue applying for renewals as a University of California lawsuit against the Donald Trump administration continues.</p>\n<p>Several signs referenced Congressman Salud Carbajal, stating that he “voted no on DACA” and is “against DREAMERS.”</p>\n<p>In January, Carbajal <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/uc-california-to-support-undocumented-students-despite-daca-repeal/\">voted for a spending bill</a> that would have prevented a government shutdown over DACA.

We have to think of those who died at sea and in the desert to get here,” second-year linguistics major Karina Javier said.</p>\n<p>I.D.E.A.S. passed around a petition during the walkout that the group had previously presented to the UCSB administration, calling for the university’s support for the needs of undocumented students.</p>\n<p>One of the co-chairs of I.D.E.A.S., who asked to be referred to as Sam, said in an email that the demands include “a permanent, expanded space for undocumented students, an attorney on campus that takes care of undocumented students’ immigrant cases, and a campus wide employment program that does not require a social security number.”</p>\n<p>“We want an attorney because of the expected growing need of immigration cases due to expirations of DACA, the abundant ICE raids all across CA and the country, and the unexpectedness of immigration legislation and policies under the current president,” Sam said in an email.</p>\n<p>Sam added that I.D.E.A.S. also wants a center on campus “because we want to make sure that undocumented students have a space on campus where they can befriend, network, support, and feel safe.”</p>\n<p>“A lot of us feel like we’re not getting the support we need from the university to move on,” fourth-year communication and psychology major Dayanna Yanez said. “We feel like it’s really unstable, the situation we’re in right now and the environment.”</p>\n<p>“There’s an anti-immigrant sentiment in this country,” fourth-year sociology and chicano studies double major Alex Gutierrez said. “I think this protest in particular is trying to highlight the fact that it’s not just DACA recipients that are trying to fight for their civil rights, but also undocumented immigrants of all backgrounds.”</p>\n<p><i>Victoria Gurrola and Katie Wolf contributed reporting.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
