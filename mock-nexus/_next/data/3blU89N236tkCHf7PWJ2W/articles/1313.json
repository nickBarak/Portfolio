After a successful season last year in which the Gauchos finished with an overall record of 13-7-1, Head Coach Paul Stumpf will look to increase his team’s win total with an extremely well-rounded squad.</p>\n<p>UCSB got off to a quick start last year as they began the season on a five-game win streak. Of those five matchups, the ‘Chos were able to keep a clean sheet in three of them. This was a major trend throughout last season as the Gauchos did not give up more than three goals in any game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Much of this success can be attributed to senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese, who came off the bench against Cal early in the season to help lead Santa Barbara to the win. Gaucho fans can expect DeWeese to be a force in front of the goal who will make her opponents earn their goals. After finishing last year with 60 saves and a save percentage of 80%, there is a lot of excitement around her potential for this upcoming season.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side of the ball, UCSB will be led by senior forward Shaelan Murison, who was recently named to the Big West preseason All-Conference Team. Murison was fantastic last year as she finished with 10 goals and four assists. In order for Santa Barbara to improve offensively, it will be crucial for Murison to not only provide veteran leadership but also create opportunities for her teammates as well.</p>\n<p>Although Murison will be key to the offensive attack, she will surely be double-teamed which means that her teammates must step up as well. Senior forward Katherine Sheehy seems to be a player that could potentially have a breakout year and help ease the pressure off of Murison. Sheehy is a playmaker and will look to push the ball with pace on the counter attack to catch opponents in a poor position defensively.</p>\n<p>For UCSB to compete for the Big West Title, the squad will need to have more of a balanced attack on the offensive side of the field. Last season, Murison had a total of a 100 shots with her next closest teammate coming in with only 19 shots.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara to have a chance to compete against the top teams in the country, other players must step up as opposing teams will place all their attention on Murison. That being said, there is strong optimism within the program that players like Sheehy will provide production offensively to make the team even more dynamic.</p>\n<p>With respect to this year’s schedule, there is one matchup in particular that Gaucho fans should be excited about, which is a home game against the California Golden Bears on Aug. 30. In last year’s contest, UCSB won in a thriller by a score of 3-2 behind strong play from DeWeese. Cal will surely be out for revenge in this game, making it a very intriguing matchup.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has already started this season strong in terms of exhibition games as they beat Westmont by a score of 2-0. Murison was able to break through in the 26th minute and junior midfielder Angelica Ortega added on with a goal in the 40th minute. With this game in control fairly early, UCSB was able to play more of their younger players to get them real game experience, which could prove to be important later down the road.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to keep up their winning ways against Minnesota this upcoming Thursday at home in Harder Stadium at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

For the second year in a row, UCSB would go on to lose their first game of the tourney at home, this time a missed penalty kick away from advancing.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking ahead, the Gauchos do have plenty to be optimistic about. One of the keys to success in any college sport is continuity, and the Gauchos are returning with a strong core including players such as senior defender Faouzi Taieb, senior midfielder Thibault Candia, and junior forward Rodney Michael. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taieb has been a key component in the Gauchos’ defensive and offensive gameplans ever since he transferred from St. Francis Brooklyn a year ago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He tallied the most minutes on the team last year with 1642, and started every match he played. The French defender plays such a huge role because of his ability to not just orchestrate the defense, but also because of his nose for the ball on set-pieces. Whether it be his game-winning tap-in last year against Gonzaga, or his header in UCSB’s exhibition win over Westmont last weekend, Taieb’s physical strength and knack for being in the right place at the right time makes him one of the most dangerous players on the field when it’s time for a free kick. His production has made it possible for UCSB to almost depend on set-pieces as the primary form of goal-scoring however, which is an issue I’ll get back to a little later on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving to the middle of the field, fellow transfer Candia has developed into one of the top playmakers in the entire conference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candia’s seven assists led the Big West last year and he has the sole assist of this season for the Gauchos in their win against the Warriors. The Parisian midfielder has been a mastermind on offense for UCSB, earning a Big West Player of the Week award last season and notching a game-winning goal against UC Davis as well. He’s usually all over the attacking third, mixing curled long balls with quick through passes that keep the defense on their feet. He is also the free-kick taker for the Gauchos, who as I mentioned before are one of if not the most lethal teams in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, star forward Michael has re-energized and added a new dimension to UCSB’s offense. While his accolades (2018 All-Big West First Team, 2018 All-Far West Region Team, and 2017 Big West Freshman of the Year, to name a few) speak for themselves, you really don’t understand just how quick and skilled Michael is until you see it with your own eyes. The junior commands a double team in almost every game, and still manages to burst through the backline and score, as evidenced by his team-leading 17 goals last season. The pressure he puts on defenses is unlike any other player in the conference, and he is the key piece that makes this team run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These three players are certainly invaluable to the Gauchos, but they’re not the only big names on the team. Reigning Co-Big West Freshman of the Year Ben Roach,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who is a wall of a goalkeeper; senior defender Noah Billingsley, who anchors the defense; and senior forward Sahid Conteh, who both playmakes and finishes at an elite level are just a few examples of other players who will be essential to success in the upcoming season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a team, the Gauchos will have to get over some of the hurdles that haunted them all of last season. As mentioned earlier, UCSB’s overreliance on set-pieces to produce goals extremely limited their goal-scoring ability. Far too often last year the team would get out into transition, or string together nice passes in the midfield for it to just fizzle out as they reached the attacking third. They lost four games by the score of 1-0 last season, which is unacceptable when putting out the amount of offensive talent that they do on the field. It also cheapens the impact of the amazing defense and goalkeeping that they consistently play night in and night out, and allows teams to stick around that they should beat handily.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will also have to make sure to maintain their composure as the season goes on. They received five yellow cards and a red already in their exhibition match against Westmont, and they just can’t afford to shoot themselves in the foot because of their temper. Finding that middle ground between playing with passion and losing control can be difficult, but the Gauchos will need to keep it cool in order to get far.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This next stretch of non-conference games, including matchups against big teams such as Virginia Tech, UC Berkeley and Gonzaga, will give UCSB a good opportunity to get back into playing shape and get some positive momentum going into the conference season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Big West play starts, the two Blue-Green Rivalry games against Cal Poly, which they play at Harder Stadium on Oct. 5 and Alex G. Spanos Stadium on Nov. 2, will of course be must-watch television. There is always no love lost between these two squads and they typically bring out the best in each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another game to circle on your calendar will be the Gauchos’ matchup with UC Irvine at home on Oct. 19. The reigning Big West Champion Anteaters are the only team in the conference to be voted into the Top 25 by the </span><a href=\"https://unitedsoccercoaches.org/rankings/college-rankings/ncaa-di-men/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">United Soccer Coaches Preseason Poll</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and will give UCSB a great opportunity to measure themselves against some of the top talent in the country.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Junior midfielder Athena Kuehn, junior midfielder Celina Nummerdor, and senior defensemen Nikki Albrecht will be tasked with leading the Golden Gophers back to the tournament this year. Last season, the trio combined to miss only one game the entire season and totalled three goals and twelve points during that time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another player to watch on the Golden Gophers is junior goalkeeper Maddie Nielsen. Nielsen played in all 23 games and finished fourth in the Big Ten with 77 saves to go along with 9 shutouts, a number that ranked second in the conference. It will be fascinating to see how Nielsen will continue to improve throughout this season, but for now she will be tasked with stopping the offensive onslaught of the Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara and Minnesota have met three times prior to Thursday’s action, with Minnesota taking each of the first two contests in 2010 and 2011, before falling to the Gauchos 1-0 in 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ‘Chos will look to take the momentum from their 2-0 exhibition win over Westmont on Saturday and translate it to success against a superior opponent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the offensive end it will most likely be senior Shaelan Murison who leads the charge for UCSB. Based on what we saw in the match against Westmont, Murison will be getting a lot of touches and taking the bulk of the shots for the Gauchos. This likely trend would be no surprise as just a season ago, Murison lead all Big West players in shot attempts by nearly double, and her 10 goals ranked second in the conference. Senior forward Katherine Sheehy will also be highly involved on offense based on her stats from a season ago, where she finished second in the Big West with five assists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the defensive side of the field, senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese is the player to watch. In 2018, DeWeese proved herself to be an elite keeper when she allowed only 15 goals on the season, good enough to rank second among all goalkeepers in the Big West. Her .800 save percentage and .94 average goals-against also placed in the top three in the Big West. DeWeese will look to take the next step in her senior year and compete for the Big West’s goalkeeper of the year award. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another player to keep your eye on in this season-opener is Lauren Hess. Hess was named to the All-Freshman team in 2018 as a defender after seeing the field in all 21 games and making an impact on a team that came very close to the NCAA tournament. On Thursday it will be interesting to see how Hess has improved during the off-season and if her role has expanded at all after a stellar freshman campaign.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The game will be played at 7:00 p.m. on Thursday at Harder Stadium.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

again going the distance with a nationally ranked team following a 2-2 tie in double overtime versus No. 25 San Diego. With this most recent result occurring on the road, the No. 18 UCSB Gauchos remain with zero losses on their away record and most importantly continue their undefeated streak of seven matches.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Entering Tuesday night’s game, the Toreros were staring at the chance to make it three consecutive wins before the Gauchos spoiled the party. The match began and ended as another heated affair as sophomore defender Ryan Johnson earned UCSB its first of four yellow cards on the night in the 23rd minute of play. Nearing the end of the first half, the Gauchos were the first to strike after junior forward Ameyawu Muntari found the back of the net off an assist by senior midfielder Thibault Candia. Seconds before the whistle, Candia then closed out the first half as the game’s second player to be painted yellow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It didn’t take San Diego very long into the second half to respond as their junior midfielder, Ross Meldrum, brought the score to one-all at the 48th minute. The night’s third goal then came minutes later as the home side took the lead in the 53rd thanks to senior midfielder Freddy Polzer. Following this, the Gauchos picked up the intensity and brought it back to two apiece off a score from junior forward Rodney Michael in the 63rd minute; senior forward Will Baynham was the provider on this play after being awarded a yellow card minutes prior. Michael’s goal ended up being the decider as neither team could manage a third goal and the result was shared 2-2 after going to double overtime. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After also tying against No. 1 Stanford just the weekend before, UCSB fans were right in their hope of a potential national ranking as the Gauchos are now considered a top-25 team in the country according to Top Drawer Soccer.

Last season, both teams split even as the Mustangs won their home game by a score of 1-0 and the Gauchos were victorious in the more recent match with a 2-0 result at Harder Stadium. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a goal in back to back games, Rodney Michael will be one to watch as he now holds two goals and two assists to his name. Candia and Baynham both remain at the top of productivity as the pair have a team-leading four goals and four assists each. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emmanuel Perez is the danger man for Cal Poly, as the junior midfielder boasts a team-leading seven goals for the Mustangs </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> along with two assists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His partner in the midfield is the Mustang captain, Diego Alonso, who just recently returned from injury and has already made a huge impact on the team’s playstyle. The Berkeley native already leads the team in assists with three in just six games and has re-energized a Cal Poly offense that was sputtering at the beginning of the season. Alonso scored the game-winner against the Gauchos in their first matchup last season, almost exactly a year ago to this date, so the depleted UCSB backline will have to keep an eye on him at all times on Saturday night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to this game will be, and has always been, which team can dominate the physical facet of the match. These two teams rarely produce beautiful games when they meet up, but they are always memorable. Players on both teams harp on the fact that strategy goes out the window during rivalry games, and while the home crowd certainly pumps up the Gauchos it will have the same effect on the Mustangs as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s time to claim bragging rights in the biggest college rivalry in soccer </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at least until these teams meet again on month from now.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Blue-Green Rivalry kicks off this Saturday, Oct. 5 at 7 p.m. as UCSB hosts Cal Poly at Harder Stadium. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90103\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/blue-green-rivalry-part-i-no-18-ucsb-set-to-host-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90103\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/blue-green-rivalry-part-i-no-18-ucsb-set-to-host-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/blue-green-rivalry-part-i-no-18-ucsb-set-to-host-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/blue-green-rivalry-part-i-no-18-ucsb-set-to-host-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/blue-green-rivalry-part-i-no-18-ucsb-set-to-host-cal-poly/","id":1311,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1310,1309,1308],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
