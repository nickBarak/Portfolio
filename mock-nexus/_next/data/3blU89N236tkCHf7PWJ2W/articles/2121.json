Senate is already doing to address menstrual product availability. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would be interested in helping out with the efforts that have already started,” Moon said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moon added that while progress has been made with some bike racks on campus, he would like to make improvements on the bike racks behind the Arbor and Girvetz Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m also interested in working on new ideas, like I’m interested in working on the issue of food insecurity,” Moon said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though Moon had not been elected during Spring Quarter 2018, he still focused his attention toward advocating for UCSB students this past year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moon went to the last two lobbying trips organized by Associated Students (A.S.) Lobby Corps, one to Sacramento and one to Washington, D.C., and has spoken to legislators on the state and federal levels about higher education issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For the state trip, we talked about the summer Cal Grant and advocated for certain budget asks… more funding for basic needs, more funding for undocumented students in terms of legal help they can get,” Moon said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moon also recently became one of the two UCSB Campus Leaders for the Student Ambassador Program within the UC Advocacy Network. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The UC Advocacy Network is a community of committed people who lend their voices to shape state and federal policies promoting the university’s mission of education, research and public service,” according to the <a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/support-uc/ucan/about\">UC’s website</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These dedicated advocates send letters and emails and call government officials and policymakers to let them know about the positive impact the university has had on them and others,” the website added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This past year, Moon has also served as the Events Coordinator of the A.S. Isla Vista Community Relations Committee. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m looking forward to working with everyone in the Senate. I’ve known these people for quite awhile now and I’m very excited to work with them within this setting,” Moon said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moon said he has not received the training that A.S. senators undergo, but he has discussed when and how to undergo the training with Internal Vice President Steven Ho. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding Salari, Moon said he believes Salari served admirably while she was on Senate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m sorry to see that the situation had to end like this,” Moon said. “I wish Yasamin the best in all of her future endeavors.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article said that Moon is currently one of the two UCSB Campus Leaders for the UC Advocacy Network. The updated version specifies that Moon is one of the two UCSB Campus Leaders for the Student Ambassador Program within the UC Advocacy Network. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

By withdrawing from Fall Quarter 2018, Martinez violated this section of Legal Code, Safadi said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it is unclear if Martinez will face any repercussions for the violation. In the statement, Safadi emphasized that there are no discernible consequences in Legal Code for executives who do not complete the required six units. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ambiguity of the legal code on the Ms. Martinez’s case is simply a microcosm of the larger problem at hand with the text: countless incompletions and uncertain instructions that arise only when cases pertaining to such occur,” Safadi wrote in her statement.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Nowhere in the legal code does it state what the implications for the incompletion of (6) units are and nowhere in the legal code does it discuss actions on an elected official’s honoraria in the case of such incompletion.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safadi also referenced the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-20/four-a-s-executives-over-last-5-years-were-not-enrolled-in-school-in-possible-violation-of-legal-code/\"> article</a> which found that four executives over the last five years were either not enrolled or took fewer than six units during their terms of service. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Previously, it was unclear what it meant for elected officers to “complete” six units, Safadi noted in a previous interview. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Upon communication with the Office of the Registrar at (805) 893-3592, University Policies were made evident and withdrawing from a quarter equates incomplete units and therefore it would not have been possible for Ms. Martinez to meet that (6) unit requirement expected from “Appointed and Elected officers,”” she wrote in her statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez maintained that she did not believe she violated Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In Zeina’s interpretation, in her experience serving for the last two quarters, she interpreted it as ‘that’s the requirement you need to hold the position,’” Martinez said. “As my experience as senator, that’s not how I interpreted it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t really say that there should be a consequence because I don’t really see it as black and white in terms of just me violating it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also said she believed the main point of Safadi’s statement was to draw attention to the lack of clarity in Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The issue of eligibility has come up several times during the 2018-2019 school year within A.S., most prominently with Martinez and former On-Campus Senator Yasamin Salari. Salari was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-26/judicial-council-unanimously-votes-to-remove-a-s-senator-salari/\">removed</a> from her position early last week after Judicial Council ruled that she violated the eligibility portion of the code by living off-campus.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to Salari’s situation, and to the ambiguity of Legal Code, Letters &amp; Sciences Senators Ricardo Uribe and Xochitl Briseno presented a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/a-s-senate-tables-bill-to-clarify-consequences-for-elected-officials-who-dont-meet-eligibility-requirements/\">bill</a> that would update the eligibility section of Legal Code at the Feb. 20 Senate meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill would give the Student Advocate General (S.A.G.) and the A.S. Executive Director, currently Marisela Marquez, the power to grant elected officials a one-time exception for failing to meet the eligibility requirements spelled out in Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An original version of the bill was written to only apply to senators, but an updated version sent out two hours before the Feb. 20 Senate meeting was expanded to include all elected officers, including executives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill has since been tabled twice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez serves as a student sponsor on the bill, and said that as the only non-partisan office in A.S., she felt the S.A.G. was the best equipped to decide whether or not to grant an elected officer a one-time exception. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safadi offered her office’s guidance to any senators who were interested in updating Legal Code, and urged the Judicial Council to write an advisory statement to the Senate to support its necessity. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Letters &amp; Sciences Senators Ricardo Uribe and Xochitl Briseño, provides elected officials who fail to meet the eligibility requirements spelled out in legal code — such as an on-campus senator living off campus, as in the case of On-Campus Senator Yasamin Salari — the opportunity to continue serving their terms.</p>\n<p>The elected official would have to obtain approval from both the Student Advocate General (S.A.G.) and the A.S. Executive Director, Marisela Marquez.</p>\n<p>The resolution is a modification of Standing Policy 36, which was introduced two Senate meetings ago by Uribe and Briseño. The policy would have given Senate the power to decide whether or not to grant a senator a one-time exception for their situation. The new bill also broadens the scope of the policy from senators to all elected officers.</p>\n<p>However, senators at the Feb. 20 meeting argued that because Senate is a partisan body, they would feel more comfortable if a nonpartisan body or office were in charge of granting the exception.</p>\n<p>“In terms of A.S., they [S.A.G.] are the most non-partisan,” Senator Uribe said at the Senate meeting.</p>\n<p>The Office of the Student Advocate is the only executive position within A.S. that is nonpartisan, as anyone running for the position must run as an independent.</p>\n<p>Aside from shifting the responsibility of reviewing an elected officer’s case to a nonpartisan body, the bill also aims to provide further clarification within the standing policy as it is.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday night’s Senate meeting, Briseño commented on the ambiguity of A.S. legal code, noting that it is a “gray area” that causes friction amongst A.S. entities, such as when it comes to determining an elected official’s eligibility under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p>This bill aims to combat legal code ambiguity problems by providing details to further clarify what factors will be included when reviewing an elected official’s eligibility.</p>\n<p>The resolution notes that “External circumstances, such as to Financial Insecurity, Physical and Mental Health, and experiencing Racism, Queerphobia, Transphobia” will be considered when reviewing the eligibility of an elected officer.</p>\n<p>Student Advocate General Grecia Martinez is the student sponsor on the resolution.</p>\n<p>Martinez did not respond to request for comment.</p>\n<p>The bill originates from the Senate’s one-time exception granted to Salari during the Nov. 14 Senate meeting. When the Senate granted Salari the exception, they also included a stipulation to discuss living situations, like her’s, in the A.S. Internal Affairs Committee.</p>\n<p>Judicial Council is currently hearing a case against Senator Salari regarding her living situation.</p>\n<p>The resolution noted that instances regarding an elected officer’s living arrangements have been presented in prior senates, with “no action to restructure legal code.”</p>\n<p>The resolution will reappear at next Wednesday’s senate meeting.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the Feb. 21, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p>\n<p><em>Max Abrams is an asst. news editor for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or maxabrams@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

<em>Nexus file photo </em></p></div>\n<p>Former A.S. Attorney General Ali Suebert represented Mukai in the case against Salari, arguing that Senator Salari violated legal code by <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/on-campus-senator-yasamin-salari-admits-to-living-off-campus-in-violation-of-legal-code/\">living off-campus</a> and that she is unable “to serve and adequately represent her constituents,” according to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-06/former-cu-co-chair-files-judicial-council-petition-about-on-campus-senator-salari-living-off-campus/\">petition.</a></p>\n<p>“We feel that it is unfair that someone is able to run for a position and campaign as an on-campus senator, getting votes from on-campus students, when other people are running for the same election under the same legal code expecting to have the same laws that they were held to,” Suebert said.</p>\n<p>Former Off-Campus Senator Alexandra Gessesse, representing Salari, defended Salari on the basis that her off-campus living arrangement does not inhibit her ability to represent her on-campus constituents and that her extenuating financial circumstances prevented Salari from living on-campus.</p>\n<p>“Understanding that she doesn’t live within her constituency is real and is a serious matter,” Gessesse said. “But Senator Salari has actively and continuously… supported the constituency in which she is elected to live in.”</p>\n<p>Salari said she based her decision to live off campus on her financial aid reward and changes in her family’s ability to pay for her tuition.</p>\n<p>“I had the fullest intention of living on-campus when I found out I was elected for Senate, however this changed after my election as I received my financial aid package,” Salari said.</p>\n<p>Citing financial struggles, Salari said that she and her family “decided that taking out more loans would not be beneficial to my education and long-term academic endeavors.”</p>\n<p>As a result of this, Salari found that her only option would be to live in her sorority house, where her financial aid would cover the costs.</p>\n<p>“I had to fall back on living in my sorority house in order to make sure that my financial aid would cover all the costs for my housing,” Salari said.</p>\n<p>Mukai’s attempt to remove her from her Senate position “inherently violates the student bill of rights” in that it would “be taking a leadership position away from an elected student due to circumstances completely out of our hands,” Salari said.</p>\n<p>“Where’s the sense of decency and understanding that students face different struggles?” Salari said.</p>\n<p>Gessesse referred to past incidents in which A.S. Senate granted one-time exceptions to senators who lived out of their respective constituency.</p>\n<p>“We [should] ask ourselves what makes Senator Salari different between the one-time exceptions that have been granted in the past,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>But Suebert contends that Senate did not have the authority to grant such exceptions, which would circumvent the power of Judicial Council.</p>\n<p>“The only person who is allowed to make exceptions to Legal Code… is the attorney general or the Judicial Council,” Suebert said.</p>\n<p>Suebert said that while Senate can re-write or amend Legal Code for future situations, they cannot grant exceptions intended to bypass current Legal Code. These checks and balances of powers with A.S. are designed for fairness among senators, which she said need to be maintained.</p>\n<p>“We’re here to make sure that all students that ran in spring election during the campaign, who also may have faced financial hardship, still are held under the same legal obligations of other students who also ran,” Suebert said.</p>\n<p>The petitioning team called in Lea Toubian, a current on-campus senator, to testify about how living within her constituency affected her ability to fulfill on-campus duties.</p>\n<p>“I think it keeps me more attuned. Since I’m still living [on-campus], it’s pretty relevant to me, but it is difficult to reach all parts of the res-hall community. I think that’s why we have like four different positions,” Tubian said.</p>\n<p>“I feel like I wouldn’t have been able to reach [students living at San Rafael] if I wasn’t an on-campus senator.”</p>\n<p>Toubian also said that running as an on-campus senator as a freshman in the Spring Quarter 2018 election, like Salari, was easier for herself since she already lived in on-campus housing and was familiar with the on campus student community.</p>\n<p>Gessesse countered that although Salari lives off-campus, she is capable of serving her constituency, which can be seen through her involvement in projects such as bring rollover dining common swipes to UCSB.</p>\n<p>Gessesse additionally argued that Salari had, in fact, adhered to Legal Code by meeting with A.S. Elections Board in regards to her living situation. A.S. Elections Board subsequently dismissed the complaint, according to Gessesse.</p>\n<p>Salari’s transparency in regards to her off-campus living situation during a Senate meeting in Fall Quarter 2018 testifies to her compliance with Legal Code and fulfillment of duties as an on-campus senator. Despite living off-campus, Salari “followed all policies that were in place when she was elected,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>The responding team also brought On-Campus Senator Zion Solomon to testify about their experience as an off-campus senator. Solomon testified that the projects they worked on as a senator are determined more by her personal passions than her designated constituency.</p>\n<p>Solomon also testified that Salari’s accessibility to on-campus students was “better than my own,” citing that Salari’s office hours are held on campus and that Salari specifically focuses on on-campus issues.</p>\n<p>At the end of closing statements, Salari asked that the Judicial Council review her case in light of the work she has done for her constituency and the financial circumstances she faced.</p>\n<p>“My work should matter more. That’s what affects students more. That’s what students care about, not where I live and where I can’t afford to live,” Salari said. “My work is directly affecting students and wanting to remove will end those projects that are positively affecting them.”</p>\n<p>Salari also asked that the Judicial Council review her case as an indicator of the changes in Legal Code needed to accommodate the current student body.</p>\n<p>“This is an opportunity for the council to respond to the changing needs of student body and interpret Legal Code accordingly.”</p>\n<p><em>Sofia Mejias-Pascoe is an asst. news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus <em>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or sofiamejias@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
