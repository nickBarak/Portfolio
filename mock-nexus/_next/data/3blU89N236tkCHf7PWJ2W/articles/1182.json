She leads the team in each of those categories except for runs batted in, where redshirt freshman infielder Vicky Kinney edges her with five.</p>\n<p>Kinney has 10 total bases of her own, accompanied by two home runs and a .714 slugging percentage. Along with senior infielder Nicole Warren (.385/.529/.692), Kinney and Klosterman are catalysts for most of Omaha’s scoring.</p>\n<p>Holding down the mound, the duo of sophomore Laura Roecker and senior Abbie Clanton are the two main pitchers for the Mavs, though each hold earned run averages over five.<br>\nRoecker has thrown in every one of Omaha’s games this season, and opponents have batted .368 against her to this point.</p>\n<p>Clanton is better in that respect, allowing a .260 batting average, but she has yet to notch a win so far this season — something Roecker accomplished on the team’s opening day.</p>\n<p>The Mavericks’ shaky pitching allows the Gauchos a valuable opportunity, one they’ll have to maximize in both games against Omaha Friday as well as at their matchup the following afternoon.</p>\n<p>Capping off UCSB’s doubleheader on Friday will be its matchup against Pacific, whom the Gauchos will play again Saturday. After losing its two opening games, Pacific owns a three-game win streak in which it has allowed only one run.</p>\n<p>The lineup is centered on a pair of senior utility players: Haylee Moran-Rowen and Cassidy Gustafson. Moran-Rowen leads the team with a .467 average, although her inability to draw a walk this season suggests her offensive production will trend downwards from here forward.</p>\n<p>Gustafson leads the team with two home runs and three runs scored; she has also contributed four RBI. She has struck out three times — tied for the squad’s most — and similarly to Moran-Rowen, she has troublingly not been walked in the season’s first five games.</p>\n<p>Most notably, Pacific has a deeper pitching rotation than Omaha and UCSB with sophomore Kenya Lindstrom and freshman Hailey Reed, who have pitched three innings each to provide solid options behind the team’s main arms, junior Marissa Young and Cassidy Gustafson. Young and Gustafson have each thrown double-digit innings in 2017 and will be the main scouting targets for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Lindstrom has been responsible for both of the team’s losses, and her 16.80 ERA is even more eye-popping when compared to the other three pitchers, all of whom have earned run averages below one.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will try to force Pacific to utilize her this weekend, hoping to make hay as other teams have been able to twice this season.</p>\n<p>Stanford, who opened up its season with six games in Arizona, was racing to a 4-0 record before losing its last two games against San Diego and Fresno State, the latter a 24-8 beat down.</p>\n<p>The Cardinal is led on offense by the scorching play of freshman catcher Teaghan Cowles, who possesses a .520 hitting clip, .556 OBP and .600 slugging percentage.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, senior infielder Kylie Sorenson owns current .400 batting, .448 OBP and .560 slugging averages. The trend of hitting continues with redshirt sophomore utility player Whitney Burks, whose stats are .360 batting, .448 OBP and .680 slugging percentages.</p>\n<p>All have at least 12 total bases and seven runs batted in (Burks leads the bunch with 11 RBI), and Cowles is the only one without a home run, though she does have a slightly rarer triple.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Carolyn Lee is Stanford’s best pitcher, holding a 1.00 ERA and 3-1 record, with two complete games, 10 strikeouts and an opponent batting average of only .228.</p>\n<p>She and freshman Nikki Bauer have combined for over 39 of the team’s 47 innings pitched, and Santa Barbara will likely see at least one of the two on Sunday.</p>\n<p>If the bats come out in full effect at Stanford and the pitchers are able to avoid the early deficits that plagued this team last week, the Gauchos should be able to rebound from their early woes.</p>\n<p>If returning to California brings no reward, however, UCSB will have dug itself into quite a hole to start the year.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces Nebraska-Omaha Friday, Feb. 17, at 2:30 p.m. It will play Pacific later that day at 4:45 p.m. Another contest against Pacific will take place Saturday, Feb. 18, at 10 a.m., while it will face Nebraska-Omaha again at 2:30 p.m. Santa Barbara will end its weekend after its noon bout against Stanford.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this

However the Gauchos cut the lead in the top of the fifth when freshman shortstop Melanie Menor hit an RBI double into left center, bringing home junior outfielder Jacqueline Hinjosa.</p>\n<p>The Titans answered back in the bottom of the fifth with another unearned run on a sacrifice fly and the Titans shut down the UCSB attack the rest of the way.</p>\n<p>In the game, Menor went 2-3 with an RBI and a double. Hinojosa went 1-3 at the plate with a run scored.</p>\n<p>In Saturday’s first game, the Gauchos played good softball; they came back from a 3-0 deficit to claim a 4-3 victory, scoring two runs in the third and another in the fifth to tie the score at three.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos took the lead for good in the seventh on a clutch homer with two outs in the inning by Menor.</p>\n<p>Menor was 2-4 on the day with two RBIs and a run scored. Arianna Palomares had a good day as she went 1-3 with two RBI’s. DP Jessica Tetzlaff went 1-2 with two runs scored, while right fielder Jessica Johnston collected two hits and a stolen base.</p>\n<p>Senior Ashley Ludlow started the game for the Gauchos, but lasted only 1.1 innings, giving up three runs (two earned) on three hits and a walk.</p>\n<p>Freshman Veronika Gulvin came on in the second and pitched the final 5.2 innings for the win, giving up no runs and six hits while striking out one. It was big day for Gulvin, as she picked up her eighth win of the season, which is very impressive for such a young pitcher.</p>\n<p>Hoping to extend their winning streak in the second game of Saturday’s double header, the Gauchos were unable to show up with the same intensity and lost to the Titans 7-1 in the season finale.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB was the first to get a run on the board when Clark singled and scored on a throwing error, the Titans tied the score in the bottom of the first and blew it open with four more runs in the second.</p>\n<p>The Titans went on to score two more runs in the game, one in the third and another in the sixth.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos could only manage three hits in the game off a trio of Titan pitchers, and Titan reliever Christina Washington pitched two innings to pick up her third win of the season.</p>\n<p>Gaucho pitcher Veronika Gulvin took the loss, giving up five runs on four hits, including two home runs. At the plate for the Gauchos, Clark went 1-4 on the day with a run scored. Tetzlaff and catcher Samantha Stark each went 1-3.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos couldn’t end the season the way they would have liked, they fought hard in every game, never gave up and played with heart. These are traits this team is highly known for and is something that they will no doubt build upon for next year.</p>\n<p>However, this year may not be over as UCSB still has a slight chance to make an appearance in the NCAA tournament. Regardless, this team’s efforts in the 2015-2016 season deserve to be applauded.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

Altmeyer rocked seven home runs and 42 RBI, both top five marks in the conference, and she was selected to both the Big West All-Freshman Team and the Second Team All-Big West.</p>\n<p>With star pitcher Ashley Ludlow’s college career over, the Gauchos will look to sophomore Veronica Gulvin to fill her shoes. Gulvin tossed 113 innings in 2016, good for second-most on the team to Ludlow, and, despite her 8-12 record, a 3.52 ERA shows the youngster has some promise.</p>\n<p>This weekend’s duels with Boston College and Wright State will pit UCSB against two brand-new opponents in their history.</p>\n<p>BC is coming off a 30-23 season, and the team retained all its offensive starters except for two. Junior pitcher Jessica Dreswick is coming off a great season (14-8, 2.47 ERA), and she combines with fellow junior Allyson Frei (186 strikeouts in 2016) to form a dominant one-two punch for the Eagle pitching rotation. The Gauchos will likely have to face one, if not both pitchers this weekend, so the offense will have to be geared up and focused on winning the small battles they can.</p>\n<p>On offense, the Eagles rely on senior catcher and third baseman Tatiana Cortez. She crushed 13 home runs on a .380 batting average in 2016, easily earning her All-ACC First-Team honors. If the Gauchos can make sure she doesn’t get into a groove this weekend, they’ll have a much easier job of containing Boston College in their two matchups.</p>\n<p>Houston was also somewhat mediocre in 2016, assembling a 27-29 overall record. With only three returning seniors, the Cougars hope a dose of fresh blood will give the team new life in 2017.</p>\n<p>Three Cougars received All-American Athletic Conference selections in 2016: sophomore pitcher Savannah Heebner on the first team and sophomore outfielders Elise LeBeouf and Maya Thomas on the second. All three were also recognized on the All-Rookie team for the conference, giving Houston a remarkable young core in 2017 and beyond.</p>\n<p>For Wright State, the combination of junior outfielder Honnah Susor, senior catcher Vivi Marquez and redshirt senior shortstop Becka Peterson will make up the brunt of the offensive attack for the Raiders. Wright State was second in the Horizon League for its second season in a row last year, and the team is eager to get over the hump in 2017.</p>\n<p>Wichita State is led by a strong senior presence, the team boasts seven in total, and comes off a 2016 season in which it won both regular season and tournament championships. Senior catcher and first baseman Macklin Hitz and junior utility player Mackenzie Wright are on the preseason All-Missouri Valley Conference team, showing the potential for this Shockers squad.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s first opponent will be Boston College at 12 p.m. on Friday, followed by Houston at 5 p.m. Saturday will pit the Gauchos against Wright State at 9:30 a.m. and Wichita State at noon. Finally, the Gauchos will rematch BC on Sunday at 8 a.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, February 9, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75578\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-softball-with-heavy-opening-slate-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75578\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-softball-with-heavy-opening-slate-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-softball-with-heavy-opening-slate-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-softball-with-heavy-opening-slate-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-softball-with-heavy-opening-slate-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/","id":1180,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[1179,1178,1177],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Struggle Mightily at Houston Hilton Plaza Invite","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-17-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-17-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB had a tough opening weekend after dropping four of their five opening matches to start the season with a 1-4 record.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After the New England Patriots were able to ride a wave of good fortune for Feb. 5’s Super Bowl, there was hope some of their luck might remain in the city for the UCSB softball team in the Houston Hilton Plaza Invitational a week later.

Loving their home field advantage, the Cougars hit through their entire lineup in the opening frame.</p>\n<p>Sophomore outfielder Elise LeBeouf singled to right field, scoring freshman utility Arielle James and advancing sophomore outfielder Maya Thomas to third, bringing up senior designated player Shelby Miller.</p>\n<p>Miller delivered, slamming a homer over the center field fence, pushing the lead to 4-0. Noriega entered her second-straight game, this time replacing junior starter Lena Mayer with only one out in the first.</p>\n<p>Freshman infielder Sarah Queen and redshirt sophomore infielder Sarah Barker were responsible for the next two runs batted in, ending the inning with six in total.</p>\n<p>LeBeouf collected two more RBI with a home run in the second inning and the Cougars again went off in the third with another five runs.</p>\n<p>Hinojosa and senior outfielder Kristen Clark accumulated the only two RBI for the Gauchos, with the former hitting in Menor for the second-straight game and the latter scoring junior outfielder Jessica Johnston on a sacrifice fly.</p>\n<p>UCSB would go through two more pitchers in the game: freshman Lilliana Rodriguez and Gulvin for the second time Friday. Houston sophomore Presley Bell would pitch the second complete game against the Gauchos that day, though the Cougars would only need five innings; a 14-2 score was enough to end the game because of the mercy rule, a deficit of 10 runs after five innings.</p>\n<p>Noriega pitched in her third-straight game Saturday, starting the 9 a.m. match against Wichita State. Seeing Noriega for the second time in two days, the Shockers jumped all over her, scoring five runs in the second inning after earning one in the first.</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman pinch hitter Whitney Pemberton was able to homer in the fifth inning for the Gauchos, scoring freshman infielder Alyssa Diaz from first. Diaz went on to earn a RBI in the sixth on a bases-loaded walk from senior pitcher Katie Malone, though the run would be credited to the freshman starter Bailey Klitzke.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos escaped with a 12-10 victory on Saturday, rallying to score four runs in the top of the seventh inning. Freshman infielder Kayla Krantz and junior outfielder Jessica Johnston hit home runs for Santa Barbara, going 2-3 with two runs, three RBI and a walk and 2-2 with two runs and one RBI, respectively.</p>\n<p>Lilliana Rodriguez got her first win of the season in the last one-and-two-thirds innings, giving up only one hit, albeit a two-run home run. Raider junior pitcher Ashley Sharp was credited with the loss, giving up five runs — four of them earned — in three-and-a-third inning of relief work.</p>\n<p>Boston College finished off the Gauchos’ weekend by again building up an early lead in the first three innings.</p>\n<p>Junior second baseman Chloe Sharabba homered over the left field fence, which was followed one out later by senior catcher Tatiana Cortez homering to left center. Junior designated player Jordan Chimento then blasted a home run down the left-field line, hitting in three runs to push the lead to 6-1.</p>\n<p>UCSB was only able to create two runs: sophomore infielder Sierra Altmeyer when Pemberton was caught stealing in the second and Clark on a wild pitch in the sixth.</p>\n<p>Junior Jessica Dreswick pitched yet another complete game against the Gauchos, and UCSB again relied on Noriega and Gulvin to gut through another seven innings. Santa Barbara’s lack of pitching depth was very apparent on the weekend and will certainly need to improve if the Gauchos are able to turn their season around after an early funk.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play Nebraska-Omaha, Pacific, and Stanford at the Stanford Nike Invitational next weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75749\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/gauchos-struggle-mightily-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75749\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/gauchos-struggle-mightily-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/gauchos-struggle-mightily-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/gauchos-struggle-mightily-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/gauchos-struggle-mightily-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/","id":1181,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[1180,1179,1178],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
