The Gauchos are reeling from a devastating series loss in which they let Long Beach come back in the final game to steal the win away from them. However, they did take a step in the right direction with a pair of solid offensive outputs over their last three games. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their upcoming opponent, CSUN, is looking to pick up some momentum as we head down the stretch in conference play after earning their first Big West series win of the season against Cal Poly last weekend. The Matadors are 5-7 in the Big West which puts them in a tie for fifth with UC Riverside, while the Gauchos are still sitting in last place, with their 2-10 conference record placing them just one game behind Cal Poly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will look to build on what was a stellar offensive series in Long Beach where they scored five runs or more in two of the three games, a feat that they had not accomplished once in conference play before then. One of the main reasons for the Gauchos’ offensive outbreak was junior infielder Devan Sperry’s arguably best series of the season, going 5-11 with multiple hits in two of the games; she became a much-needed contributor to a team that desperately needed more run production. Sophomore infielder Maci Fines also had a stellar series as she recorded a hit in each game, solidifying herself as one of the most consistent producers on the team. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An encouraging note for UCSB is that sophomore outfielder Sammy Fabian is due to get back to her old ways and start hitting again as she has cooled off after she was nearly unstoppable earlier in the year. Fabian is hitting .397 on the season but just .250 in conference play, as she has been unable to put together consistent at-bats as of late. This is encouraging for the team because they seem to be improving on offense even with their best hitter being in a bit of a slump. If she can break out along with the rest of her teammates, the Gauchos might be able to peak near the end of the season and surprise some folks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal State Northridge also has some positive momentum going their way, however, as they were able to claim their first Big West series victory of the season mainly due to the great work of their pitching staff. Northridge is not the deepest squad in the Big West by any means; however, they have a pair of quality pitchers to look out for along with possibly the most dangerous hitter in the entire conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSUN has two pitchers that rank in the top 10 in the Big West in terms of E.R.A. Sophomore Kenedee Jamerson’s 3.19 mark puts her at ninth overall, and sophomore pitcher Jillian James and her 2.15 E.R.A. is good for fourth in the league. James is the clear ace of the staff, as she leads the entire conference in innings pitched, with 172.1,  and she is also second overall with 187 strikeouts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from the pitchers, the one person who the team should gameplan for is junior outfielder and pitcher Megan Stevens, who bats .455 on the season with 47 runs batted in. These stats, paired with her 12 home runs on the season, demonstrate the power and skill of Stevens, but it is more important to stress that no one else on her team hits over .300, so if the Gaucho pitchers can neutralize her, they will put themselves in a position to win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The three-game set begins with a Saturday doubleheader starting at 1 p.m. at Campus Diamond.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Not only did the Gauchos lose 63% of its games this season, but UCSB finished in the eighth and final place of the Big West Conference with a 7-14 conference record, coming out on top in only one third of interleague contests.</p>\n<p>With the series loss, Cal Poly dropped to 25-25 overall, 9-12 in conference play to finish in the fifth spot in the Big West Conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although the shadow hanging over Santa Barbara’s season may be gloomy, UCSB looked fairly dominant in its final series of the 2018 season.</p>\n<p>The series opener slipped in the Gaucho’s favor after huge run production in the sixth and seventh innings to send the contest into extra innings. Some late-game heroics by junior shortstop Melanie Menor drove in the winning run on a walk off single in the bottom of the ninth inning to win a 10-9 standoff as the infamous Blue-Green Rivalry kicked off for the final time this season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara carried over this momentum into the Saturday doubleheader and managed to perform on a supreme level in the first game of the day as the Gauchos displayed overwhelming power at the plate that has been lacking for much of the year.</p>\n<p>A first inning 3 RBI double by sophomore first baseman Hailey Martin propelled the Mustangs out in front early, but junior second baseman Sierra Altmeyer had an immediate answer come her first plate appearance of the day.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer responded with a 3-run jack of her own to even up the game at 3-3, her seventh bomb of the year.</p>\n<p>Complimented by a solo shot by sophomore center fielder Rayna Cohen, the Gauchos were tied at 4 runs a piece heading into the bottom of the seventh inning.</p>\n<p>Boosted by a walk-off single in game one of the series, UCSB felt confident with their cleanup hitter stepping up to the dish with 2 outs in the final inning of play.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer blasted her team-best 8th long ball of the 2018 season to walk-off Santa Barbara in dramatic fashion with a 5-4 win and pull out the team’s first series win since mid-April. This homerun marks UCSB’s third walk-off hit in conference play on the year.</p>\n<p>The second base standout has turned it on in the final stretch of the season going 4-9 in the last series of the year with 2 deep bombs and 5 RBIs as she improved her batting average to .323 in her third season with Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos raked senior ace Lindsey Chalmers on two appearances over the weekend as she longed for the ever-coveted 20-win mark. The only thing standing in her way was the hidden power displayed from UCSB bats.</p>\n<p>Chalmers was limited to 8.2 innings pitched over two starts and allowed 11 runs in the process. She finished with an 8.99 ERA over the course of the three-game series dropping her holistic season earned run average to 2.57 as she was unable to come up victorious in either of her two starts. The righty ended the season with 19 wins and 9 losses, nonetheless good for second most wins in the Big West.</p>\n<p>While the first two games decided the outcome of the series winner, Cal Poly didn’t complacently lay down in the team’s season finale.</p>\n<p>UCSB came out firing as Rayna Cohen drove in sophomore infielder Genesis Ramirez to thrust ahead in the bottom of the first inning.</p>\n<p>From there, both offenses remained silent until Poly erupted for a 5-run fourth inning which caused sophomore southpaw Felisha Noriega to see her day come to an end.</p>\n<p>For the next 3.1 innings, junior right-handed pitcher Veronika Gulvin maintained composure by allowing only 1 hit in her final appearance of the year.</p>\n<p>Gulvin hasn’t particularly lived up to each and every expectation this season, yet this past weekend she shined bright and previewed some special talent that we look forward to seeing next season. The junior threw 6.2 innings over two appearances against the Mustangs allowing only 1 run throughout the weekend.</p>\n<p>Although Gulvin was dominant, she didn’t receive much help from the offense as UCSB dropped its final game of the series by a score of 5-1.</p>\n<p>Gaucho pitching struggled immensely this year as three of the four active pitchers culminated their seasons with ERAs over 5.0.</p>\n<p>Yet the future is bright for UCSB! We saw promising performances from many young and well-rounded players. Freshman left fielder Sammy Fabian finished off her year with a team-best .335 batting average and displayed sheer and dominant speed early in the season. I would love to see more aggressive baserunning in conference play from Fabian since finished fourth in stolen bases in the Big West, although all of the steals came prior to Big West play.</p>\n<p>Inversely, freshman infielder Maci Fines was unreal come conference play. She started out the year batting roughly .229 in the former half of the season, but once she started to compete with Big West teams, the third baseman began to produce at exponentially high levels. She hit a near .400 in Big West play which rose her batting average on the year to .290.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also have young help in the circle. Freshman pitcher Emily Schuttish came alive in the latter half of the season as she was the go-to starter for conference play. Her most prominent month of starts came during April in which UCSB saw a rise in strikeouts per 7 innings from 3.72 to 4.70. Schuttish only saw .1 innings worth of time in the circle during May and we saw a destructive increase in ERA as it rose from 3.81 in April to 8.08 in May.</p>\n<p>There should be more of Schuttish next season as the ace on this Gaucho team. Hopefully, the soon-to-be second year compliments the other young batters well enough to improve on the 34-loss season.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, its essential for junior second baseman Sierra Altmeyer and sophomore first baseman Alyssa Diaz to assume a major leadership role over the offseason and take control of this team to smoothly usher in the younger players.</p>\n<p>Both infielders have a distinguishable leadership role on the team and must continue to push the rest of their Gaucho squad in order to improve in seasons to come.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83088\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-13/gauchos-finish-strong-take-series-to-close-out-uphill-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83088\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-13/gauchos-finish-strong-take-series-to-close-out-uphill-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-13/gauchos-finish-strong-take-series-to-close-out-uphill-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-13/gauchos-finish-strong-take-series-to-close-out-uphill-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-13/gauchos-finish-strong-take-series-to-close-out-uphill-season/","id":1270,"author":{"id":36,"name":"Max Kelton"},"related":[1269,1268,1267],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Season in the Books: Gauchos Score Four Players on All-Big West Conference Teams","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2018-05-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SoftballTEAM-170512-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SoftballTEAM-170512-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Although it was a bumpy ride, the UCSB softball team finished off the year strong with a victory over rival Cal Poly.

Pitchers struggled with Altmeyer in the clean-up because Diaz has such a staunch reputation for getting on base, thus giving Altmeyer so many opportunities to drive in runs.</p>\n<p>While the first baseman Diaz played in all but the final seven games of the season, she assumed a premier leadership role on the team in just her second year as she slashed .325 on the year and turned it on during conference play to improve her average to .357 against Big West foes.</p>\n<p>All five of Diaz’s home runs came during the non-conference half of the season and nearly 78% of her RBIs were against out-of-conference competitors. Nonetheless, the second-year standout was named to the all-conference second team for the second consecutive year.</p>\n<p>Much like Diaz, we saw an influx of outstanding contact hitting from freshman infielder Maci Fines during conference play. The first year began her breakout season at third base but shifted over to the shortstop spot toward the end of the year as sophomore third baseman Kayla Krantz returned from an ankle injury.</p>\n<p>Fines was awarded All-Freshman team honors for the Big West Conference considering her all-star worthy .380 batting average during Big West competition in 2018. Fines ability to read the ball well lead her to the least number of strikeouts between active batters on the UCSB roster as she only got rung up 9 times this season.</p>\n<p>Her batting average and aggressiveness gradually increased as she became more comfortable at the plate in the latter half of the season.</p>\n<p>While Fines hit .231 and .217 respectively in the first of the season, she bettered her batting to .350 in April en route to shining from an outstanding performance in May in which she smacked .458 over a 6-game stretch. In fact, Fines took a six-game hitting streak into the final match against Cal Poly while four of those six games resulted in multi-hit contests for the first year.</p>\n<p>Last, but not least, freshman left fielder Sammy Fabian rounds off the list of Gauchos with All-Big West honors as she too earned a spot on the Freshman All-Conference team. Fabian was the sunshine on this team’s season-long cloudy day that was unfortunately covered up by a plethora of other struggles going on with the Gauchos this year.</p>\n<p>Fabian began her career with UCSB this season batting .433 through the first 12 games. She led her fellow ‘Chos in batting average for the majority of the season finishing with a team-high mark of .335 for the year.</p>\n<p>While the three other players that earned honors were the most appealing during Big West play, Fabian boasted early and dominated during non-conference play. The freshman flashed a .356 average to start off the year and notched her way up to fourth in the Big West in steals with 9.</p>\n<p>Yet, when it came to conference competition, Fabian wasn’t nearly as effective. She walked less and struck out more, but what might have hindered her the most was the team’s failure to give Fabian the green light on the base path.</p>\n<p>With the resounding speed and aggressiveness she displayed during the former half of the season, it was surprising how she didn’t steal one single base during conference play. Worst of all though, Fabian was never given the chance on the base path during Big West play. She was signaled to steal zero times after an impeccable first half of her season she spent running all over catchers.</p>\n<p>With only three seniors graduating this year, the Gauchos plan to bring back virtually the whole team in the 2018-2019 season and get a taste of redemption after struggling to win only a third of their games this season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83214\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-23/season-in-the-books-gauchos-score-four-players-on-all-big-west-conference-teams/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83214\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-23/season-in-the-books-gauchos-score-four-players-on-all-big-west-conference-teams/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-23/season-in-the-books-gauchos-score-four-players-on-all-big-west-conference-teams/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-23/season-in-the-books-gauchos-score-four-players-on-all-big-west-conference-teams/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-23/season-in-the-books-gauchos-score-four-players-on-all-big-west-conference-teams/","id":1271,"author":{"id":36,"name":"Max Kelton"},"related":[1270,1269,1268],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Searches For First Big West Win, Takes On Aggies","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2019-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Softball_vsDayton-180222-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Softball_vsDayton-180222-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The last-place women's softball team will be looking for their first conference win this weekend as they get set to host the UC Davis Aggies.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_82971\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Softball_vsDayton-180222-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"938826145\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"87130\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82971\" data-attachment-id=\"82971\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/freshman-10-maci-fines-transition-to-the-college-game/maci-fines-slap-hits-in-an-attempt-to-get-on-base-dustin-harris-daily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Softball_vsDayton-180222-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1376&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1376\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Maci Fines slap-hits in an attempt to get on base.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will look to get back on track after being swept in their conference opener against Cal State Fullerton. The Gauchos are currently on an extended losing streak of 12 games, while on the other side the Aggies had won eight in a row before losing to Cal State Northridge on Sunday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The season has been a struggle so far for UCSB after beginning the year on a high note. They won three of their first four games, but the season has gone downhill since then. Their 0-3 conference record, along with their 6-28 overall record, puts them last in the Big West at this point in time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though the season has been a struggle so far for the Gauchos, things seem to be looking up for them. They performed impressively against a very good Cal State Fullerton team — the score was tight in every game of the last series, even forcing extra innings in the second of their three game set. There is still a lot of time left in this season and much room for the Gauchos to improve.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, UCSB has been led by sophomore outfielder Sammy Fabian, whose .444 batting average places her at second in the entire Big West Conference. She also slugs .485 and has proven to be a tough contender at the plate, with only six strikeouts out of 99 at-bats this season so far. She has a record of six stolen bases, ranking her top five in the conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos pitching staff is led by junior Felisha Noriega, who boasts a 5-12 record in her 22 appearances. In 87.1 innings pitched, Noriega has posted a stellar 3.37 ERA with six complete games and K/BB ratio of 55/46. Noriega will be the key to UCSB’s success as the longer she is able to go, the better chance they have of sticking around and — possibly — upsetting UC Davis. The rotation is rounded out by Veronika Gulvin, who has an ERA of 4.81, and Emily Schuttish, who has an ERA of 5.74.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other side, UC Davis’s successful season has been due to an elite pitching staff and a top-heavy lineup full of great hitters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leading the way at the dish for the Aggies is Senior Meghan Bradbury, who is batting .312 and a major power hitter. She is fourth in the Big West and first on her team with 29 RBI’s, along with seven dingers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Bradbury is not the only slugger in the lineup for the Aggies. Their team includes four starters recorded as batting above .300 and six starters hitting over .275. This combination provides a tough challenge that can wear down any opposing pitcher.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis is able to rely on their hitters to win games, but their elite pitching staff is arguably the biggest reason they’ve earned one of the best records in college softball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore Brooke Yanez has been one of the best pitchers in the country this season as her 1.08 ERA and 164 strikeouts are each good enough to lead the Big West in each respective category, while also placing top ten in the entire country. Yanez is backed up by senior Sara Cadona, who is second in the conference with a 1.91 ERA, and by junior Katie Kibby, whose 2.69 ERA is good for seventh in the conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis’s deeply talented pitching staff has been the key to their success this season, and UCSB will have to really fight in order to win against one of the Big West’s elite teams.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The series will kick off with a doubleheader on Saturday, April 6. It begins at 1 p.m. at Campus Diamond.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 8 of the April 4, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87130\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/ucsb-searches-for-first-big-west-win-takes-on-aggies/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87130\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/ucsb-searches-for-first-big-west-win-takes-on-aggies/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/ucsb-searches-for-first-big-west-win-takes-on-aggies/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/ucsb-searches-for-first-big-west-win-takes-on-aggies/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/ucsb-searches-for-first-big-west-win-takes-on-aggies/","id":1272,"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone"},"related":[1271,1270,1269],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
