When the campus was still open, another group of researchers in the Materials Department made batches of hand sanitizer for community use. And presently, professors across campus are developing a coronavirus test that would be simpler and faster than the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) coronavirus test.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Face Shield Production</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back in the CNSI lab, Magnuson and David Bothman, the organizer behind the face shield production, work opposite shifts to keep the 3D printer running to produce as many parts as possible for the face shields. The shields, which are meant to go over medical goggles and face masks, consist of a transparent shield, headband and strap, all based off a </span><a href=\"https://budmen.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">design created by a 3D printer manufacturer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. By early April, the team had created and delivered 40 face shields to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital and had 40 more ready for delivery. But the hospital’s needs are “tremendous,” said Bothman, who normally lectures on mechanical engineering at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The hospital needs 10,000 shields of the style we’re making. We can make, you know, 20 or 30 a day … but it’s clear that a lot of other people and people with a lot more manufacturing capability are going to need to be involved,” Bothman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other groups on campus have joined in the production of face shields, including Roger Green, manager at the chemistry and biochemistry machine shop. He and Andy Weinberg, the machine shop superintendent, obtained enough materials to make 3,000 face shields. The two had finished cutting the clear plastic covers for 200 shields with a 3D printer in early April and with the help of a couple more people in the production process, Green said his team would likely soon be able to produce about 200 clear plastic covers a day.</span></p>\n<p><b>Hand Sanitizer Production</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over in the Materials Department, Assistant Professor Angela Pitenis had been worrying about the coronavirus pandemic early on. Before </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-10/breaking-ucsb-to-transition-to-remote-instruction-beginning-tomorrow-through-end-of-april/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB canceled in-person classes on March 10</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, she cut the normal lesson plans she had for her graduate class, Colloids and Interfaces,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and instead presented on the colloidal formation and stability properties of hand sanitizer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking notice of the rising anxiety over coronavirus among the students in her class, she decided to dedicate a lecture to demonstrate how to make basic hand sanitizer. Then she had the idea to produce hand sanitizer for the entire campus community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This whole project really began as a truly class exercise to demonstrate basic principles, but it also links back to the work that we do every day in materials science,” Pitenis said. “I think it was a very good lesson for the students to be able to see how lessons in the classroom can translate to practical engineering solutions, especially in response to COVID-19.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joining forces with colleagues Rachel Segalman, Raphaële Clément, Craig Hawker, Christopher Bates and Michael Chabinyc, all professors in the UCSB Materials Department, the group pooled together their reagents to begin manufacturing hand sanitizer in their labs for community usage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Basically, any kinds of solutions we could find, we would put them together,” Pitenis recalled. She said she isn’t sure how much hand sanitizer they made altogether, but she estimates “gallons.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Segalman’s lab members, chemical engineering doctoral student Audra Destefano, came up with the creative idea to design a label and call their hand sanitizer “Universal Corona Sanitizing Balm.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The name], which was very clever … really encapsulated the efforts we were trying to do here, which was to support our community,” Pitenis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The scientists distributed their hand sanitizer around campus, including among their shared facilities, the Materials Research Lab and the CNSI.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the hand sanitizer went directly to those shared facilities to support students and staff at the time who were still having to use those shared facilities to maintain their critical research, and also to support our staff, who might not have time in between experiments to wash their hands,” Pitenis described.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Pitenis emphasized handwashing over hand sanitizer, noting that it is more effective and a practice that the CDC </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/pdf/hand-sanitizer-factsheet.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recommends</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since campus operations, including most research labs, have shut down, Pitenis and her colleagues have ceased their hand sanitizer production, for now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think we’ve made enough to support the needs of our community,” she remarked, adding that if there was a need for more, her team could always produce additional hand sanitizer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think we’re all trying to help out as much as we can; I think this is a total team effort right now. And I’m just incredibly amazed and I’m just humbled by the efforts of my colleagues,” Pitenis said.</span></p>\n<p><b>Coronavirus Test Development </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Across campus, four professors from the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (MCDB) are working tirelessly to develop a coronavirus test that would be faster and easier to use and would not “rely on the common reagents that the rest of the world is scrambling to get,” said Max Wilson, an assistant professor in the MCDB department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilson, Carolina Arias, Diego Acosta-Alvear and Kenneth Kosik all know each other from teaching and working together in the MCDB department, but as the coronavirus pandemic tore through U.S. communities and the lack of available testing became more obvious, the group stepped up to help fill the gap in resources and information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We saw that there was a massive need for testing and we decided that we would use our labs and our skills as molecular biologists to help,” Wilson said. “We were all scientists studying other things before this. We dedicated funds from [other projects] to develop this because we saw how important it was.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the CDC’s test as a benchmark for accuracy, the team created a test for coronavirus that uses an enzyme similar to the family of enzymes used in a CRISPR test, a method that </span><a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/16/coronavirus-test-crispr-mammoth-biosciences/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scientists around the nation have already begun to tap into</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that targets repetitive DNA sequences. This test uses the enzyme to recognize the presence of the coronavirus viral genome and indicates a positive or negative result on a lateral flow dipstick, a testing device similar to those used for pregnancy tests, according to Wilson.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the beginning of April, the group was tinkering with adjustments to the test to make it cheaper and easier to use. The professors also began looking into the process of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, which is currently being fast tracked for coronavirus tests but could still likely take months. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s gonna be a long way, unfortunately,” Arias said. “We are still far. I don’t want to give anybody false expectations or false hope </span>that we’re going to have something that can be deployed tomorrow. It is a process [that requires] approval.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to developing a new coronavirus test, the professors </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also donated enough critical reagents, an essential component in the current CDC coronavirus test, for 600 tests to the Cottage Health laboratory, the Santa Barbara Independent </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2020/04/02/ucsb-molecular-biologists-to-the-rescue/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arias’ role in the project has been to coordinate approval processes and navigate protocols for the research to take place. Besides that, she also teaches general animal virology to a class of 185 students remotely –– a task faced by UCSB’s entire teaching faculty and one they had a mere </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-24/pandemic-pedagogy-faculty-prepares-for-first-quarter-of-remote-instruction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two weeks to prepare for</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> –– and serves on UCSB’s COVID-19 Response Working Group. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And we have families so we don’t stop. If it’s not one thing, it’s another one,” Arias said. “I cannot even tell you at what time [the day] begins or what time it ends.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the researchers are propelled by an extreme sense of urgency to find solutions and provide information to the public, a collective effort they “hope is going to be significant” in the community’s fight against coronavirus, Arias said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking ahead, the team is discussing the possibility of using their coronavirus test in a research project that would focus on the prevalence of coronavirus in asymptomatic patients. The project could reveal information about how the virus spreads, but until the test is FDA approved, patients involved in the project would not be able to know the results of the testing, Wilson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While much remains uncertain about the timeline of their projects and the future in general, Wilson, Arias, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acosta-Alvear and Kosik are steadfast in their mission to help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people might feel helpless and I just want to reassure them that many of the best scientists I know are working as hard as they possibly can to come up with solutions that will ease the pain on this pandemic,” Wilson said. “There are things coming.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The Gauchos shot 867 over the three days, finishing nine shots behind first place UC Davis. Senior Kei Kita and sophomore Paul Otte both finished in the top five, at third and fourth respectively.</p>\n<p>“Paul played a great round of golf yesterday [Monday],” Head Coach Steve Lass said. “I think no bogies during the entire round, the low round of the day and Kei just played really well all three days.”</p>\n<p>Kita shot 72 in the first round on Sunday but followed that with a strong second round, shooting a 69 on Monday, just two strokes behind the leader Otte, who shot a 67 in that round.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I kind of felt like I was in a groove for the first nine holes,” Kita said. “I hit a lot of good shots that day, had a lot of good putts and at the end of the day it turned out to be a 69.So it was good.”</p>\n<p>Kita capped off his tournament with a 71 on Tuesday and led the Gauchos with a total of 212 in the Big West Championship.

He was replaced by junior Jordan Epstein who struggled, putting up a total of 240.</p>\n<p>“It is kind of tough to get the call at the last minute, and Jordan has been kind of struggling with his game.” Lass said. “It made things a little more difficult for the team but all in all I thought fifth place was a good finish.”</p>\n<p>To finish off his career, senior Russell Boring tied for No. 16 overall, as he improved his score by one each day, going from 74 to 73 and finally to a 72 in day three, totaling to 219. Freshman Hunter Robinson tied for No. 26 with a 223.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got a bunch of great guys on our team, lots of talent,” Kita said. “In the second round we played a great round of golf. We shot like 500 as a team, so obviously the talent is there, so hopefully we will be able to keep this going. It should be good for the future Gauchos.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46659\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/ucsb-places-final-competition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46659\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/ucsb-places-final-competition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/ucsb-places-final-competition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/ucsb-places-final-competition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/ucsb-places-final-competition/","id":1802,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[1801,1800,1799],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
