Santa Barbara holds a record of 8-4-1 overall and an even 1-1 conference standing. The Mustangs enter Harder Stadium with a record of 5-5-5 overall and 1-3 in the Big West.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Despite its loss, this past weekend was a learning experience for the young Santa Barbara team.</p>\n<p>UCSB started four freshmen against Long Beach including midfielder Sydney Magnin and forward Mallory Hromatko. Although they did not score a goal, the two helped get touches to sophomore forward Amanda Ball and senior forward Savannah Francis, who both returned from injuries in Saturday’s match.</p>\n<p>“It’s great getting these experienced players back on the field,” junior defender Sydney Fuertes said. “This allows our subs to maintain the same level of play the game started at and mix [it] up depending on the personnel.”</p>\n<p>Francis and Ball have been sidelined for the majority of the season, Ball being out since UCSB’s 1-1 tie versus San Jose State on Aug. 28. The two have made an impact in their two games back combining for seven shots and one goal.</p>\n<p>The majority of the Gauchos’ offensive production has been a result of their younger players’ contributions as the freshmen have scored 13 out of UCSB’s 20 goals, a team well on its way to surpassing its mark of 32 goals in 2014. Of the 13 goals, Hromatko has really taken the lead in the attacking third.</p>\n<p>“[These freshman] have not been intimidated by this new environment of college soccer,” Stumpf said. “Their ability to make adjustments on the fly and incorporate it in their games highlights their high [soccer] IQ. What we’re asking them to do in short order has been a pleasant surprise for us.”</p>\n<p>Hromatko has started all 13 games at forward for the Gauchos tallying in a team-high six goals and four assists. Her six goals are tied for fourth place in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Of the nine games that Hromatko has either scored or assisted UCSB has won seven contests. The freshman forward ranks among the top 10 in conference points, shots on goal percentage and game winners. Hromatko’s excellent performance has not gone unnoticed, earning a nomination for Big West Player of the Week three times this season.</p>\n<p>“We’ve relied on a younger squad this year but they’ve really stepped up to the occasion,” said Fuertes. “It’s awesome seeing so many freshmen seizing this opportunity to help out the team.”</p>\n<p>On the defensive end junior defender Sydney Fuertes has recently been the focal point for Santa Barbara’s backline. While individual stats don’t show it, Fuertes has helped the Gauchos’ defensive unit to a low .83 goals against average, good for third place in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“[Sydney] has all those great qualities of leadership by example, said Stumpf. “She’s not the best athlete but she’s smart and can anticipate things so well.”</p>\n<p>The San Clemente native also played a major role last season starting 19 matches as a sophomore for UCSB. Feurtes’ defensive contributions propelled her team to five shutouts this year.</p>\n<p>While Cal Poly is on a two-game losing streak, the Mustangs will be looking for another win against their rival. Hosting the Gauchos on Oct. 26 last season, the Mustangs used their home field to their advantage, scoring two early goals in the third and 14th minutes and securing a 2-0 victory.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Caitlyn Kreutz and junior forward Megan Abutin will carry the load for the Mustang offense.</p>\n<p>Kreutz has quickly filled her role at the forward position for Cal Poly placing third in the Big West with seven goals. The freshman from Clovis has recorded a pair of goals in three matches this season, the last one coming off the Mustangs’ 7-2 victory over Hawaii on Oct. 4. Kreutz has been very disciplined in taking good looks at goal earning fourth place in the Big West with a shot percentage of .333.</p>\n<p>Megan Aubutin is the main facilitator of the Mustangs, setting up teammates and tallying in five assists on the year. It will be the offensive production of Kreutz and savvy decision making of Abutin that UCSB must be aware of.</p>\n<p>One final piece to the Mustang’s offense is senior forward Elise Krieghoff. Krieghoff has five goals on the year and 51 career goals during her four years at Cal Poly. Also a Clovis native, Krieghoff earned her ninth career Big West Player of the Week award after scoring one goal apiece in the Mustangs’ 1-1 tie against then No. 6 BYU and preseason top-25 team Pepperdine.</p>\n<p>On the defensive end the Gauchos face arguably the best goal keeper in the Big West, senior Alyssa Giannetti. Emerging as the defensive leader for her team, Giannetti is one of the premiere defensive players in conference ranking in the top five in saves and save percentage.</p>\n<p>“The challenge we face is it can’t just be something good to go in. It has to be special,” said Stumpf. “That’s what it’s going to take to beat someone like [Giannetti].”</p>\n<p>Starting all four years for the Mustangs, the keeper from Yorba Linda has racked up 80 saves this season, 25 more than any keeper in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB will take on Cal Poly at Harder Stadium this Thursday. The match will kick off at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of October 15, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65417\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ucsb-shifts-focus-to-annual-blue-green-clash/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65417\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ucsb-shifts-focus-to-annual-blue-green-clash/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ucsb-shifts-focus-to-annual-blue-green-clash/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ucsb-shifts-focus-to-annual-blue-green-clash/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ucsb-shifts-focus-to-annual-blue-green-clash/","id":1480,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1479,1478,1477],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton","biography":"Not available","articles":[324,325,330,331,332,333,334,335,336,339,344,346,348,352,367,371,1387,1459,1460,1461,1466,1479,1480,1484,1488,1489,1499,1500,1503,1505,1506,1513,1524,1528,1529,1900,1959,1962,1976,1983,1988,1990,1995,3260,3281,3282,3303,3307,3324,3359],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Silences Cal Poly in Shutout Victory, Late Score Prevents Overtime Against UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensSoccer_10-15-15_5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensSoccer_10-15-15_5-web.jpg?resize=392%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's soccer team continues to climb its way up the Big West standings with wins over Cal Poly and UC Davis in the past week.

Coming off a 1-0 loss against Long Beach State last Sunday Sunday, Head Coach Paul Stumpf emphasized the team’s focus of sticking to what it does best.</p>\n<p>“[Our] tactics didn’t really change,” Stumpf said. “We wanted to [maintain] possession of the ball throughout the match. We knew we were in for a physical battle, more than what we saw at Long Beach, but [our] players kept their composure very well.”</p>\n<p>UCSB improves to an overall record of 10-4-1 and 3-1 in conference. In addition, Santa Barbara is now third in the Big West standings, just one-match behind tying first place Cal State Fullerton.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos controlled possession from the first whistle, racking up five corner and five shot attempts by the end of the first half.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65523\" style=\"width: 238px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensSoccer_10-15-15_5-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1119098947\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65544\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65523\" data-attachment-id=\"65523\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/ucsb-silences-cal-poly-in-shutout-victory-late-score-prevents-overtime-against-uc-davis/christinademarzo_womenssoccer_10-15-15_5-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensSoccer_10-15-15_5-web.jpg?fit=392%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"392,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Hannah Dearborn sets the ball for a teammate, gaining an assist.

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>It didn’t take long for Santa Barbara to put a point on the board as sophomore midfielder Dakota Griggs lined up for her third corner in the 12<sup>th</sup> minute, sending a perfect cross for sophomore defender Kate Shoemaker. Grigg’s pass had just enough hang time for Shoemaker to beat her defender and head the ball into the back of the net.</p>\n<p>“I told myself let’s put this game away from the beginning and not let it go on,” Shoemaker explained. “Even if you’re the better team, if you don’t put away the ball you could lose [the match] so I just took a chance to get a goal.”</p>\n<p>The score marked Shoemaker’s second goal of the season. Prior to the goal, her lone score of the year came during UCSB’s 3-2 non-conference win over Saint Francis on September 13<sup>th</sup>.</p>\n<p>Senior goalkeeper Beth Ritter also made her presence known on the defensive end, tallying three saves in the first half including a diving grab in the 25<sup>th</sup> minute off the shot attempt of Cal Poly midfielder Emily Hansen.</p>\n<p>Replacing junior goalkeeper Jacq Caginia, Ritter has now started seven out of UCSB’s 16 matches this season. The Danville native ranks among the top five in the Big West in goals against average at .86 and total goals against with seven. Caginia holds a first place ranking in goals against in the Big West at five.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos resumed their offensive attack in the second half as senior Savannah Francis lined up for a free kick in the 67<sup>th</sup> minute. Shooting from 30 yards out, Francis placed a ball just in the reach of sophomore forward Amanda Ball to head it past diving junior goalkeeper Alyssa Giannetti to the back left corner of the goal. This was Ball’s first score of the year since coming off an injury on August 28<sup>th</sup>.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs’ closest chance at goal was in the 40<sup>th</sup> minute off the crafty footwork of freshman forward Caitlyn Kreutz. Kreutz beat junior defender Sydney Feurtes and freshman forward Marrisa Salvoldi down the left flank placing a line drive to the left of the net only to be met by Ritter.</p>\n<p>Things got chippy in the 69<sup>th</sup> minute as Emily Hansen and Jessica Parque scrambled for the ball around center field. After throwing an inadvertent elbow at Parque, Hansen was issued a red card and ejected from the game. A total of 25 fouls were issued between the two rivals, two yellow cards and one red card given to the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos closed things off in the 75<sup>th</sup> minute as junior forward Hannah Dearborn stole the ball from a Cal Poly defender and led a two-on-one attack with Parque. Off the give-and-go from Dearborn, Parque took advantage of Giannetti’s misjudgment to try to save the ball and booted a kick to the back of the net for the score. The goal pushed UCSB’s lead to 3-0. Another goal from Dearborn in the 79<sup>th</sup> minute gave her team a comfortable lead, ending the match in a 4-0 victory. Cal Poly’s loss to its rival dropped the Mustangs to 5-6-5 and 1-4 in Big West play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos managed to take care of business Sunday in their match against the UC Davis Aggies. With the match tied at one a piece heading into the second half, freshman forward Mallory Hromatko led an attack down the line in the 86<sup>th</sup> minute. She took a pass from freshman defender Ryan Kokoska and launched a kick to the upper left corner of the goal past Davis’ redshirt freshman goalkeeper Alexis Smith for the score.</p>\n<p>This was Hromatko’s seventh goal of the year and her fourth game-winner of the season. The freshman’s late score sealed the deal for her team as Santa Barbara secured the win with a final score of 2-1. The loss lands UC Davis with an overall record of 8-6-2 and 1-3-1 in conference.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play its final two home games at Harder Stadium next weekend hosting the Highlanders of UC Riverside at 7:00 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 23<sup>rd</sup>. On Sunday, Oct. 25<sup>th</sup>, Santa Barbara will pay tribute to its seniors in a 1:00 p.m. match against UC Irvine.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65544\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/ucsb-silences-cal-poly-in-shutout-victory-late-score-prevents-overtime-against-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65544\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/ucsb-silences-cal-poly-in-shutout-victory-late-score-prevents-overtime-against-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/ucsb-silences-cal-poly-in-shutout-victory-late-score-prevents-overtime-against-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/ucsb-silences-cal-poly-in-shutout-victory-late-score-prevents-overtime-against-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/ucsb-silences-cal-poly-in-shutout-victory-late-score-prevents-overtime-against-uc-davis/","id":1479,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1478,1477,1476],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Five Game Win Streak On the Line at Sac St.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos have gone a perfect 4-0 to start Big West play.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_65268\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1895733115\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65306\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65268\" data-attachment-id=\"65268\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/five-game-win-streak-on-the-line-at-sac-st/msoccer_vsakron-20150925-dustinharris-5-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-5-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"While dribbling down the field, Duncan Backus looks for an open teammate.

The Hornets enter with the worst record in the North at 4-7-1 overall and 1-3 in conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We’re beginning to play with each other’s strengths and making sure we eliminate a lot of our weaknesses,” Acheampong said. “We’re taking it one at a time right now. The Sac. State game is one that we must win.”</p>\n<p>As a team that looks primed to head into the postseason with a No. 1 seed for the third-straight season, Santa Barbara’s success over the past year has been directly related to the contributions of forward Nick DePuy.</p>\n<p>In games that the junior has scored, UCSB is a near unstoppable 15-0-3. Since moving to forward from the midfield in 2014, DePuy has scored 21 goals in 26 games, the most in the nation during that stretch.</p>\n<p>Recently, DePuy’s production has been as consistent as ever. He has a Big West-leading 12 goals and has scored in five consecutive games, all UCSB wins, notching the game-winner in four straight games.</p>\n<p>DePuy’s work on the field has earned him three straight Big West Offensive Player of the Week awards, making him the first to ever do so. Now totaling five in his career, he has moved into a tie for third all-time in the Big West.</p>\n<p>All this consistent success has put DePuy in the national spotlight. With three goals and two game-winners on the road in the conference’s opening weekend, the Irvine native earned his second career National Player of the Week award. With seven game-winners this season, he has two more than anyone else in the country.</p>\n<p>While DePuy has done all he can for his team, a couple of first-year Gaucho forwards in freshman Geoffrey Acheampong and sophomore Ahinga Selemani have given UCSB the much-needed support in the attacking third that it lacked last season.</p>\n<p>“I like to always be on the field, I like to always help the team, I like to contribute, and that’s what I’ve done,” Acheampong said. “That’s what I’ve done all my life and that’s what I look to do at UCSB. I do what I can with my talent to beat my man or find Nick in the box, and he’s kind of hard to miss.”</p>\n<p>Acheampong’s success has also correlated with the team’s success, as he has scored or assisted in six of the Gauchos’ last eight games. He is currently tied for first in the Big West with five assists, and UCSB has a record of 7-0-2 when the Cate School graduate has recorded a point.</p>\n<p>Another left-footed attacker in Selemani is tied with Acheampong with three goals for second-best on the team to go along with two assists. The transfer from Michigan has put the pressure on defenses all season, ranking fourth in the conference with 36 shots.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to make sure that we use all of our bodies, make sure that everybody’s fresh,” Selemani said. “You could tell the last couple games we’ve been getting tired. I think it’s important that everybody’s ready and focused because anyone can be called upon the next couple games to give good minutes and get us a win.”</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB has tallied 27 goals for the year, averaging over two per game and nearly matching its 2014 total of 30. Dating back to last season, Santa Barbara has won seven straight conference games and is undefeated in nine straight.</p>\n<p>“We have to go in with the mentality as the alpha team and go in and dominate,” Acheampong said. “We go in with the mentality that we have to have those games. When it’s clear that that’s the goal of the team and that is what everybody’s coming in to do, it makes it a lot easier.”</p>\n<p>On the defensive side, freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg has gotten off to a great start to his NCAA career with a record of 9-2. His goals against average of 0.89 ranks second in the conference, while his .787 save percentage is the third-best mark.</p>\n<p>Sac. State doesn’t possess nearly the same kind of firepower as its North Division counterpart, scoring just 15 on the season, one more than last-ranked Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>While the Hornets enter tomorrow’s game well under .500, their record isn’t necessarily an accurate representation of how good a team they are. A rough schedule to open the season saw them play eight of their first 10 games on the road. When playing at home, they are a much better team, going 2-1-1 in four outings.</p>\n<p>Sac. State’s only conference win came at home in a 3-2 victory over UC Irvine. Sophomore goalkeeper James Del Curto recorded 14 saves in that game, the most of any player in Division I soccer this season. He ranks second in the Big West with an average of 4.5 saves per game, a stat which could be inflated due to a defense that has allowed the second-most goas in the conference at 1.7 per game.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side, redshirt freshman forward Brad Bumgarner leads the way with four goals. A balanced attack has seen five other Hornets score two goals.</p>\n<p>Twenty-seven-year Head Coach Michael Linenberger earned Big West Coach of the Year honors in 2014 as Sac. State qualified for the Big West Tournament for the first time since joining the conference four years ago.</p>\n<p>The game is set to kickoff at 4:00 p.m. tomorrow at Hornet Soccer Field.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65306\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/five-game-win-streak-on-the-line-at-sac-st/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65306\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/five-game-win-streak-on-the-line-at-sac-st/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/five-game-win-streak-on-the-line-at-sac-st/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/five-game-win-streak-on-the-line-at-sac-st/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/five-game-win-streak-on-the-line-at-sac-st/","id":1477,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1476,1475,1474],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Sacked at Sac St., Face Cal Poly Next","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/soccer-3-of-11-print.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/soccer-3-of-11-print.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Suffering its first loss of the season, UCSB will travel to face Cal Poly in a hostile environment this Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Five was the magic number for the UCSB men’s soccer team coming into yesterday’s road matchup at Sacramento St., as it looked to win its fifth straight game to open conference play.

The Hornets had played eight of their first 10 games on the road, getting them off to a 3-6-1 start. However, they entered their home matchup with the Gauchos with a solid 2-1-1 record at Hornet Field.</p>\n<p>After a strong first half effort by the Hornets sent them into the break with a 2-0 lead over UCSB, the Gauchos came out strong in the second stanza. Sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht scored for the second consecutive game in the 47th minute, putting in a rebound to cut the lead in half.</p>\n<p>In the 64th minute, Sac St.’s Ivan Ramirez extended the Hornets’ lead off a Gaucho turnover. The junior midfielder led a breakaway before dribbling around UCSB freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg to finish into the open net, making it 3-1.</p>\n<p>Just 20 minutes later, the Hornets ended any hope of a late comeback with another goal from junior defender Preston Davis.</p>\n<p>It took only 34 seconds for junior left back Ismaila Jome to answer back for UCSB. Playing in his first game since suffering an ankle injury nearly a month ago, Jome capitalized on a Sac St. turnover before firing a shot over the keeper, giving him his first goal of the season.</p>\n<p>Already on their way to defeat, the Gauchos conceded yet another goal in the 88th, with Sac St.’s junior defender Argenis Ramos scoring another rebound goal for his team.</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman Brad Bumgarner has led the Hornets all season on the offensive side and he didn’t disappoint in the first half. After picking up an assist on teammate senior forward Isaac Flores’ goal to open the scoring in the 24th minute, Bumgarner scored one of his own in the 34th, giving him a team-leading five goals on the season.</p>\n<p>Despite outshooting the Hornets 19-17 on the night, Vom Steeg was only able to make two saves on the night as his record as a starter fell to 9-3. UCSB had not conceded more than two goals all season prior to yesterday’s game.</p>\n<p>Last night also marked the end of forward Nick DePuy’s run of five consecutive games scoring. The junior still leads the Big West in goals by a wide margin with 12 on the year, five more than any other player. UCSB is a near perfect 15-0-3 when DePuy scores.</p>\n<p>Picking up an assist on the Gauchos’ first goal against Sac St. gave freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong six on the year, also the most in the conference.</p>\n<p>UCSB will now shift its focus to Saturday’s matchup with Cal Poly, the No. 27 ranked team in the RPI rankings as of October 12.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly has scored only 16 goals this season, just one more than the conference’s worst goal scoring teams, but has found success thanks to its stifling defense.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs have gotten off to a 2-1-1 start in conference, allowing just 0.95 goals per game, good for second best in the Big West. Senior goalkeeper Wade Hamilton has led the way with a 0.95 goals against average, the second best mark in the conference. As a team, Cal Poly has five shutouts this season, tied with Cal State Fullerton for a number one ranking.</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams played, UCSB came away with a huge 2-0 win on the road. This will be the first of two Blue-Green matchups that will take place in the span of seven days, as Cal Poly will come to play at Harder Stadium next Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of October 15, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65415\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/gauchos-sacked-at-sac-st-face-cal-poly-next/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65415\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/gauchos-sacked-at-sac-st-face-cal-poly-next/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/gauchos-sacked-at-sac-st-face-cal-poly-next/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/gauchos-sacked-at-sac-st-face-cal-poly-next/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/gauchos-sacked-at-sac-st-face-cal-poly-next/","id":1478,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1477,1476,1475],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
