Speakers at the recital included Margo Halsted, former UCSB university carillonist; John Majewski, UCSB dean of humanities and fine arts and Nick Masuda, director of news at the Santa Barbara News-Press.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The structure and the instrument resting within the tower were both gifts from the late Thomas M. Storke, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and owner of the Santa Barbara News-Press for 32 years. During the dedication ceremony on Sept. 28, 1969, he stated: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is my hope that the publications coming from this building will be the finest examples of journalism developed on any campus in America — perhaps in the world.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the five decades since, the KCSB-FM radio station, La Cumbre yearbook and the Daily Nexus have made their homes at the base of the tower.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honoring this amount of history was no small task. According to Arai, almost a year was spent preparing for the semicentennial: “The thing that took the longest was to work with the two composers we commissioned to write new pieces for the event. I would say the resulting two pieces are one of the major successes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Golden Sounds,” by UCSB Professor Emeritus Emma Lou Diemer, was one of those pieces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I sat at the piano and held down the sustaining pedal to simulate the prolonged sounds of the carillon,” she wrote in an email, “and proceeded to write a piece that incorporated three different melodic elements and other musical ideas that are effective on the carillon.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second piece was “Fantasy on FIAT LUX” by world-renowned composer Aaron David Miller, which featured variations on the university motto “Fiat Lux” by the late Carl Zytowski, who was a UCSB professor of Music music for 44 years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Each letter of the motto spells out a musical theme which became the compositional material for the fantasy,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additional pieces included “Piece Without Expression No. 1” by Frank Percival Price, “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring” by Johann Sebastian Bach and “Fandango” by Ronald Barnes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The instrument that made all of these performances possible was the carillon atop Storke Tower, which contains 61 bells and is one of only six such installations in California. It is played with fists and feet that strike a set of wooden keys each corresponding to a specific bell: the heavier the strike, the louder the sound.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The largest, lowest bells weigh up to 2.5 tons, while the smallest, highest ones can weigh as little as 13 pounds, so you need to be careful with the balance and not let the low bells totally bury the high bells,” Arai said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In principle, this is not too different from how someone would play a piano or an organ, but the similarities end there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes there’s a bit of trial and error, where something I arrange just ends up being impossible to play or doesn’t sound good on the bells and I need to rework it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these challenges, Arai, Diemer and Miller all agreed that the experience of playing a carillon is worth the learning curve, especially given the sweeping view of campus and the Pacific Ocean from atop Storke Tower.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is good to see and hear beyond and within one’s self,” Diemer wrote, and “it’s fun and exciting to create sounds with those 61 bells.” Miller invoked the concept of fun as well, writing that “I don’t know of another instrument you work up a sweat while playing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You’re by yourself, high up in the tower when you play, far away from any listeners,” and “at least for me, this can actually make performing somewhat relaxing, unlike if you were performing on a stage where you can see your audience staring at you,” Arai added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, more than the performance itself, and true to Storke Tower’s tradition of learning and community expression, passing on the knowledge of the carillon is the best perk that comes with playing it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a bit more than just ringing the bells,” Arai said. Every quarter, he trains three students on how to play the carillon. “I think this is the most rewarding part, getting to work with enthusiastic, talented students and teaching them this very unique art.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diemer agreed. “It all comes together sometimes: people, music, memories, creating, learning, never giving up, using one’s talents and perfecting them as much as possible, cherishing the marvelous gift of life, being thankful for all of that. But learning is probably the most important. Isla Vista is full of people who are doing just that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the event may be over, the celebration and education continue. The next carillon recitals will be held on Nov. 17 at 11 a.m. and Nov. 24 at 10 a.m. in front of Storke Tower. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

id=\"caption-attachment-67162\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The reference desk was merged with the services desk. <em>Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reference desk, previously 30 feet away from the library’s mountain side entrance, was removed on Sept. 14 and merged with the services desk by the Paseo West entrance; while this may be a new change to the UCSB community, Library </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communications &amp; Marketing Manager Hannah Rael believes that it isn’t an outdated practice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reference desk removals at libraries [have] been a trend for more than a decade,” Rael said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, library reference desks are desks that professional librarians sit at to help direct students to what they are looking to find. But due to internet advances and other technical innovations that allow users to access information in a handful of seconds, libraries have had to rethink the ways in which they make directional and reference information easily accessible to students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Rebecca Metzger, associate university librarian for research, the merging of</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the reference desk and services desk is the culmination of a three year-long planning process involving the strategic review and redesign of the library’s frontline service model. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During those [three] years, we gathered data, held facilitated discussions with reference librarians and staff, introduced an online system for booking reference appointments and experimented with different hours and staffing models,” Metzger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brightspot, a strategy firm dedicated to collaborating with universities and other institutions in order to improve student services based on technological shifts and social changes, was brought in to assist library staff with the redesign to better serve users of the library. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We worked with [Brightstop] for two months, guided by a steering committee in the library. Two open town halls were held for library staff, and Brightspot led multiple additional focus groups to gain input,” Metzger said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Metzger explained that the ultimate goal was to provide library visitors with a well-structured experience. Formerly, each desk was managed by a different library department and staff went through distinct training programs. Now that the desks are merged, all desk staff will have the same consistent service training and be able to provide users with answers to whatever questions they may have. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We wanted to improve the user experience and service consistency. In the past, it wasn’t obvious which desk to start at. Students would sometimes get bounced back and forth between the two desks to get the answers they needed,” Metzger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, as reported by the </span><a href=\"https://www.arl.org/arl-statistics-survey-statistical-trends/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Association of Research Libraries</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there has been an 84% decrease in reference questions within the past twenty years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Metzger, only one-third of the questions asked at the Davidson Library’s reference desk were reference-related questions. By removing librarians from the reference desk, their time is no longer spent addressing basic questions that can instead be answered by trained staff and students at the service desk. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, this merge allows the library to make more effective use of its resources, Metzger stressed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were investing in duplicative staffing by having student assistants and staff on the reference desk and services desk only 30 feet apart at the same time,” Metzger said. “Our data shows us that the same types of questions were being asked at each desk, [and] by streamlining our staffing, we are able to continue to invest in other projects that improve the library.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the services desk now takes on reference-related matters, it still maintains many of its old functions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The services desk continues to be the spot for checking out books, media, course reserves, interlibrary loans, laptops and other materials,” Metzger said. “In fact, you can now also check out calculators, phone chargers, bike locks, board games and frisbees.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Library users are encouraged to submit their feedback via the library’s online s</span><a href=\"https://www.library.ucsb.edu/suggestions.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uggestion box</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, said Metzger. Alongside a handful of students submitting feedback saying that they miss the reference desk, library staff have also had to grow accustomed to these changes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Library staff are still learning how to provide service in the merged environment so there may be some growing pains, but they are deeply committed to providing quality service to our UCSB community,” Metzger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, the library is currently in a transition period as it has moved on to revamp its service training program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are monitoring how [the training program] is going and are open to making tweaks as we learn more. The truth is that we live in a fast-paced environment where library services have the potential to change regularly based on trends, user behavior and input and data,” Metzger said.</span></p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-90634\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program is designed to help international students find their way around UCSB. </span><em>Sam Rankin/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashley Rifkin, a program coordinator at the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), said over email that the program is designed to help international students find their way around UCSB, “creating opportunities for both international and domestic students and staff to build friendships, share cultures, and developing critical 21st century cross-cultural communication skills in a welcoming and supportive small-group setting.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The OISS staff anticipates roughly 133 mentors and mentees in total for this fall quarter. The office plans to put on events throughout the year for mentorship pairings, but the goal for the program is for the pairs to find and share commonalities in their free time as well, Rifkin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It takes a great deal of courage to leave your family and friends behind to pursue their academic aspirations,” Rifkin said. “The Global Ambassador Program tries to ensure that our international students feel welcome and included.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mission of OISS is to “cultivate an inclusive environment which supports international students academically, professionally and personally by providing holistic advising on immigration, employment and cultural matters</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” according to its website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The staff and advisors at OISS recognize that international students often have difficulty making friends and can feel uncomfortable sharing their culture, Rifkin said, and added that similar programs have found success at universities like UC Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opportunity to mentor also gives experienced UCSB students the opportunity to gain important skills in an increasingly global world, Rifkin explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This holds true with Lauren McKnight, a third-year biochemistry major who was a tour guide for international students over the summer who said she wanted to continue cultivating those relationships during the school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having grown up in southern California, I’ve always been really familiar with the culture in California and the U.S. By getting to know my mentees and other international students, I get to see a little bit more of their perspective of the environment here,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McKnight added that the Global Ambassador Program not only creates an easier transition for international students but overall increases campus diversity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annie Joost, a global ambassador and fourth-year global studies major, said she has cultivated friendships that extend beyond the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We also have a great line of communication through [Snapchat] and WhatsApp. We try to meet [up] just to study, or if one of us is just hanging out in IV we try to let the group know that they can join us!” Joost said over email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am hoping to build some great friendships and to learn more about the different cultures within my group,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another mentor, Jordan Kaiser, fourth-year global studies major, said she understood the difficulty of trying to cross a cultural barrier from her time studying abroad in Berlin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wished I had a program like this when I was abroad. I often felt confused or lost when I was abroad and had a hard time breaking out of my ‘American bubble,’” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Rifkin, the program not only benefits international students but also the ambassadors who learn to view the world through a “different cultural lens,” particularly those interested in working in an international field or studying abroad.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As international educators we recognize that global exchange is a two-way street,” Rifkin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB’s domestic students and staff stand to learn just as much as from our international students and scholars as they do from joining our campus community.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

and pat-downs outside of the Thunderdome</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Out of these discussions came the idea for a big Halloween concert, which Armistead said was completely student-run. Beyond providing security, portable toilets and parking, the university has no role in putting together the event; instead, members of the Associated Students Program Board (ASPB) spend months gathering booking data about artists, reaching out to their agents and narrowing down the list of potential performers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nathaly Pacheco, special events coordinator for ASPB, fields requests from students and other board members about the genres of music or artists they want to see perform at the annual event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make sure we cater to what you guys want,” Pacheco said, emphasizing that events are funded by student fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With board as a whole, no matter what we do, we have to think students are our number one priority.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the past week, Pacheco and the rest of the ASPB staff have been working to ensure the show runs smoothly. On Saturday, Pacheco and the production coordinator will be starting their day at 7 a.m. to oversee the set up of all the production equipment, like the audio, lighting and any special equipment Program Board ordered at the artist’s request. They won’t go home until 2 a.m., when they wrap up clean-up for the show. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pacheco, who is going into her third year on Program Board, said her experience on the board in previous years has helped her work with other members more cohesively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I truly feel like you can’t be a good leader unless you know what the other people that are working for you are doing,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this year’s show, and her time on Program Board as a whole, Pacheco said it was important to her to bring a diverse lineup to campus; she pointed out that UCSB has never had a female headliner perform at any of their shows. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s a big problem, even within the industry; it’s like such an issue of seeing powerful women or seeing women being represented in this specific industry,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pacheco said Program Board was actually in touch with Megan Thee Stallion to bring her for Delirium but said the timing didn’t work out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Leikeli47, one of the supporting acts at this year’s Delirium, Pacheco said the board tries its best to “bring and showcase diversity when it comes to the artists that we bring to the campus and stay on the wave of artists that we think are only going to keep growing and growing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really, really want to make sure that we do that this year,” she said. “I know that we have a really big Latinx community here at this school — it’s the second biggest demographic — but we don’t cater to Spanish music or other different genres of music.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiyomi Morrison, program board commissioner, emphasized Pacheco’s sentiments about wanting to invite more student input to Program Board’s internal processes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’d like [students] to meet the Program Board people, and then also make our office hours available so they can come in at any time, talk to anyone, not only for talking about the programs that we do, but if they need help doing events or if they are interested in working or volunteering with us,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Morrison pointed to the Associated Students’ Finance and Business Committee’s public posts last year that documented where student fees were going and said that was something she was interested in implementing, particularly because Program Board has a high lock-in fee, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Program Board is working with a budget of $1,110,106.25 for the 2019-2020 academic year, according to a budget presented by last year’s commissioner, Ryanne Ross, at the end of last year. While a lot of the budget goes toward the larger special events, Program Board also puts on regular Free Tuesday Films, Storke Tower shows, shows in the Hub, lectures and other events throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the money that Program Board makes from charging for smaller events goes toward subsidizing costs for larger events, Morrison added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to events like Delirium, Morrison and Pacheco said the safety of students is of the utmost priority to them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We throw a lot of big festivals where a lot of people are drunk and that kind of stuff, and also, police are required to be there,” Morrison said. “We’re on the student side … we are here for you guys and we want to make sure you are safe, first and foremost.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pacheco said police presence at this year’s show is expected to be the same as previous years, and that students can expect metal detectors and pat-downs outside of the Thunderdome.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know that Halloween here is pretty dead, and it’s just like, people go home, people decide to go to other places,” Pacheco said. “This is one of the things that people can do in a fun and safe way.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
