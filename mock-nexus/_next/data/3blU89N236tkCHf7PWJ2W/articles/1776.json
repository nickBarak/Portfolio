USC was a Pac-12 champion a year ago,” said Macedo. “Having some men out of the meet [Saturday] was disappointing and difficult for us. Swimming that meet against that caliber of competition with 11 guys: It was challenging, but I’m proud of the way they swam.”</p>\n<p>Missing from UCSB’s intended 12-man lineup for the day was junior transfer from University of Indiana and IM/breaststroke swimmer Jonathan Panchak, who suffered a neck injury.</p>\n<p>Of the 14 events that took place on Saturday, 11 of which were individual races, UCSB managed to finish in first place twice.</p>\n<p>Emerging for the Gauchos’ first victory of the meet was senior Yoessef Tibazi with a time of 48.88 seconds in the 100-yard butterfly. USC senior Michael Domagala narrowly trailed him with a clock-in time of 49.35 seconds.</p>\n<p>Following right after Tibazi with a win in the 100-yard IM was sophomore backstroke/IM swimmer Douglas Nogueira. He collected the first-place finish in 52.41 seconds, just ahead of two fellow Gauchos, Tibazi and sophomore butterfly/IM swimmer Javier Lopez. Tibazi placed second with a time of 53.70 seconds while Lopez was registered at 54.33 seconds.</p>\n<p>Certainly the victories of Tibazi and Nogueira elicited a sigh of relief from the Gauchos, but it was evident the team’s lack of players — due to suspension and the women’s team not having a scheduled meet — took its toll on the players who competed Saturday.</p>\n<p>“They [didn’t] have the women to separate and give them more time in between races,” said Macedo. “Some of those boys had to go from one event directly into another and that’s a really hard way to go into that meet. We’ve got some work to do; we looked a little sloppy in some areas, but at the same time we know what we need to improve.”</p>\n<p>Sure enough, USC took advantage of the Gauchos’ shortcomings and ended Saturday’s meet with a total of nine first-place swimmers.</p>\n<p>Leading the Trojans with two first-place wins was junior Dylan Carter. He established his presence early in the third event of the meet, winning in the 200-yard freestyle at 1:37.90. Finishing with a time nearly four seconds quicker than the second-place finisher, Carter’s imprint on the meet surfaced early.</p>\n<p>But the competition became more intense as the Trojans’ top swimmer participated in the 100-yard freestyle, which also included the Gauchos’ prominent Tibazi. Carter prevailed and continued his dominance with victory at a time of 45.47 while Tibazi swam closely behind at 46.09 seconds.</p>\n<p>Surely the Gauchos’ lack of depth should be of consideration when analyzing the results of Saturday’s meet, but much work is to be done if they plan on helping their first-year coach obtain immediate success.</p>\n<p>Although Macedo is in his first season as head coach at UCSB, it is his third year with the program. While he’s still working to figure things out inside the pool, Macedo doesn’t have to change his vision too much, as most of the pieces he’s been working with since day one are still in place.</p>\n<p>“What I want to do is continue a very strong culture of hard work and academic success,” said Macedo. “I want to put my own twist on that; we’ve got a new staff this year [and] Gregg is still around volunteering, [which] is a real resource of mine to have him to bounce ideas off of and [see how did he] handle this in the past.”</p>\n<p>Next for both the UCSB men’s and women’s teams is the program’s annual Intrasquad and Alumni games. The pair of exhibition matchups with take place on Saturday, Oct. 8 with the Intrasquad game starting the morning off at 9 a.m., followed by the Alumni match at 11 a.m.</p>\n<p>Both games will be hosted at Campus Pool.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72802\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/gaucho-mens-team-comes-up-short-vs-trojans/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72802\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/gaucho-mens-team-comes-up-short-vs-trojans/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/gaucho-mens-team-comes-up-short-vs-trojans/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/gaucho-mens-team-comes-up-short-vs-trojans/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-03/gaucho-mens-team-comes-up-short-vs-trojans/","id":1776,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1775,1774,1773],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White","biography":"Not available","articles":[163,251,282,290,292,293,300,302,311,312,314,315,316,327,328,329,337,338,340,341,343,345,347,349,350,351,353,356,357,361,362,363,364,365,368,370,372,373,375,376,379,381,382,385,387,389,391,392,393,395,396,398,401,406,407,408,414,426,447,452,453,455,468,471,487,488,492,504,506,507,513,517,528,529,530,583,585,601,674,975,1208,1363,1415,1428,1430,1443,1473,1775,1776,1777,1872,1873,1881,1886,1889,1890,1893,1908,1911,1914,1971,1974,1984,1993,2005,2020,2021,2025,2849,3280,3283,3284,3290,3298,3299,3304,3306,3310,3322,3323,3325,3338,3381,4102,4954,4981,4988,4991,4996,5041,5044,5049,5055,5070,5071,5072,5073,5074,5075,5076,5077,5079,5080,5081,5082,5088,5089,5097,5098,5120,5121,5151,5152,5317,5340,5342,5343,5345,5347,5349,5365,5367,5368,5369,5371,5384,5387,5388,5389,5390,5391,5393,5394,5395,5401,5479,5509,5543],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Perform in Cross Country Championships","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Cross Country","publish_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men's cross country team takes first in the Big West Championships, while the women finish in third.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This past weekend proved to be a huge one for the UCSB cross country team as the men’s team captured the Big West title while the women placed third in the Big West Cross Country Championships this Saturday.</p>\n<p>The first four of five finishers in the men’s 8k were Gauchos.

However, his return to the pool deck would eventually change with an increase in duties.</p>\n<p>“What I realized was I missed the stimulation of the student-athlete, the challenges that presented themselves here [at UCSB],” Wilson said. “They decided during my absence to merge the men’s and women’s teams. They invited me back [as the] aquatic director [and] head coach and that started the programs together. It exceeded my expectations; I had to learn a lot. I went down to working 60-70 hours a week and everything really took off. It was an experiment for the department. It worked so well that they merged the men’s and women’s track programs and that was right at the beginning of a lot of programs across the country merging men and women together.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72857\" style=\"width: 236px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72857\" data-attachment-id=\"72857\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/retirement-celebration-for-ucsbs-aquatic-legend-gregg-wilson-this-saturday/gregg-by-jenny-luo-online-6/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1333,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"gregg-by-jenny-luo-online-6\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?fit=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-72857\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?resize=226%2C339\" alt=\"gregg-by-jenny-luo-online-6\" width=\"226\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?w=1333&amp;ssl=1 1333w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gregg-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-6.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 682w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72857\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gregg Wilson was UCSB’s head swim coach for the past 40 years. He saw two of his athletes win Olympic gold medals. <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The merge of both the men’s and women’s programs marked Wilson’s return to UCSB for the 1985-86 season. From that point on, he became the pioneer of a new and improved culture at UCSB that fostered a generational growth for the next 40 years.</p>\n<p>A mastermind of the complexities within swim, the veteran coach accumulated a myriad of accolades that comfortably rank atop the Gaucho record book.</p>\n<p>Wilson retired with a total of 36 Big West titles and was appreciated for his prominence within the conference, winning 27 Big West Coach of the Year awards in addition to earning two Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) Coach of the Year honors.</p>\n<p>Defined by longevity, it is surprising that he initially was signed on a short-term contract for five years, but the terms were eventually eliminated.</p>\n<p>The extension of Wilson’s time at UCSB may serve as one of the program’s most beneficial decisions, as his guidance helped enhance the skills of various talented swimmers. Throughout Wilson’s tenure, approximately 72 swimmers were rewarded with All-American status. Most notably, his prevalence in national competition ascended as well, as he coached three Olympians, including former Gauchos and Team USA gold medalists Richard Schroeder and Jason Lezak.</p>\n<p>Although the extensive list of milestones were well-deserved achievements, Wilson’s never allowed his reputable coaching status to outshine the true importance of maintaining a commitment to his student-athletes.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have a lot of scholarship money, so I set the goal of [seeing] what I could do with raw material,” Wilson explained. “[My mindset was] come here for very little or nothing and let’s see what we can do. Probably the best example of that are the two gold medal winners that we have.”</p>\n<p>Schroeder walked on to the UCSB swim program out of the junior college ranks and worked his way into representing the United States at the 1984 Summer Olympics, excelling and earning gold. Following Schroeder nearly two decades later was Lezak, who Wilson explained was a good swimmer coming out of high school but reached his pinnacle at the collegiate level, becoming an All-American and eventual gold medalist as well.</p>\n<p>Ignoring the fact that UCSB may not have ever been considered an elite swimming program, Wilson’s commitment to teaching student-athletes the true craft of swim fueled his long-term stay in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, those student-athletes appreciated this passion, as his lasting impression remains evident.</p>\n<p>“He represented a great legacy for 40 years,” senior Meghan Bicomong said. “Gregg’s really personal with the Gaucho family. Everyone is connected together [which helped] build team comradery and that really hits home for me because he’s super personal and that’s what kind of helped me to get into this school and helped me decide on going here.”</p>\n<p>Certainly, Wilson possessed a competitive edge when coaching, but it was his hospitable nature that provided a sense of balance that attracted the likes of so many players.</p>\n<p>“I played water polo for the most of my life so I didn’t think I was going to be much of a swimmer,” senior Matt Drum explained. “My high school season ended, then I got this call from Gregg and he’s like, ‘Hey, do you want to come swim at UC Santa Barbara?’ I didn’t do so well my last year [of high school] but Gregg somehow still believed in me to come here, so I owe him a lot for that.”</p>\n<p>Well-deserving of his recognition for the mark he has left on the UCSB campus and swimming program, Wilson’s efforts expand to the Santa Barbara community as a whole with the establishment of Wilson Swimming. The community swimming program offers swimming camps and lessons here at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p>While Wilson’s impact will remain unmatched, UCSB has shown great appreciation for the former coach with the creation of the Gregg and Carol Wilson Swimming Enhancement Fund. The fund will aid and support the swimming program’s operational budget.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Gregg Wilson’s retirement party will take place this Saturday, Oct. 8 from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. in Corwin Pavilion. The event is nearly sold out, but happy hour tickets, priced at $50 each — in which all proceeds will benefit the Gregg and Carol Wilson Swimming Enhancement Fund — can be purchased online on the

<em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email, sent out by Jeffrey Stopple, associate vice chancellor for undergraduate education, and Leesa Beck, director of Summer Sessions, said the decision to move all Summer Sessions courses online came after “further consultation with campus health experts, faculty, students, and key stakeholders.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university is also working to provide digital alternatives to lab and studio courses, Stopple and Beck said in the email, adding that “Instructors in the sciences and arts are collaborating with the pedagogical experts in Instructional Development” to restructure the classes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tuesday’s decision to move all Summer Sessions online also means that the university will deliver its Transfer Edge program and Freshman Summer Start Program remotely, according to the </span><a href=\"https://www.summer.ucsb.edu/covid-19-faqs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Summer Sessions website. </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus housing will also not be “generally available” during Summer 2020, and students who cancel their summer quarter or drop classes by the deadlines “will receive a full refund,” according to the website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two UCSB pre-college programs — the Research Mentorship Program and the Summer Research Academies — will also be held remotely, according to the website; a third program, the Summer Scholars Program, which allows high school students to enroll in two classes for college credit, has been canceled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university has yet to announce a decision about the status of fall quarter instruction. </span></p>\n<div
