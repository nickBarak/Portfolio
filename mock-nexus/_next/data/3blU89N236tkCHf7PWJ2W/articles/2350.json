The <em>Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-will-spend-up-to-40k-on-ads-discouraging-deltopia-crowds/\">reported</a> in February that the university spent $30,000 on advertisements for Halloween weekend last year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advertisements are one of the ways the university has tried to curb attendance during party weekends like Halloween and Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada said the campus-wide efforts build on the student-based “keep it local” initiative, a campaign that runs television and radio advertisements throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs sends letters to college students throughout California that outline regulations that could impact students if they choose to attend Halloween in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university also sends letters to local junior high and high schools urging students to not celebrate Halloween in I.V.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katya Armistead, dean of student life, said the Office of Student Life met with representatives from Associated Students and UC Isla Vista in the beginning of Fall Quarter to share the content of the advertisements and receive feedback. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Batsheva Stoll, external vice president of local affairs, said she appreciates the university’s efforts to decrease attendance in I.V. during Halloween weekend but said the advertisements are an expensive option and can provoke misunderstanding.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ads themselves can give I.V. a bad rap by making it seem like a scary hostile place when it’s our home and our community,” Stoll said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kelly Hoover, spokesperson for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s office (SBSO), the turnout for Halloween weekend has steadily decreased over the past three years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SBSO estimated that “several hundred” people were in I.V. for Halloween weekend last year, Hoover said, a significant decrease from the 13,000 partygoers that visited I.V. in 2013. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Santa Barbara Police Department (UCPD) will have about 55 officers patrolling I.V. this weekend, said Sgt. Rob Romero, UCPD spokesperson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD will also source officers from four other University of California campuses to assist in patrolling, including officers from San Diego, Riverside, Irvine and San Francisco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hoover said there will still be a strong law enforcement presence in I.V. this weekend, despite the decreased turnout in recent years. The SBSO does not release the number of officers assigned to an operation for safety reasons, Hoover said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been really pleased with what we’ve seen in the last couple of years, with students really having pride in their community and their school and wanting to keep Isla Vista safe,” Hoover said.</span></p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-79287\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Parking restrictions have been enforced for the past several years in response to a historically large out-of-towner presence in I.V. for party weekends like Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p><strong>ISLA VISTA</strong></p>\n<p>According to the Associated Students’ (A.S.) Halloween website, street parking will be prohibited starting at 9 a.m. on Friday, Oct. 27, until 6 a.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 1, on the 6500, 6600 and 6700 blocks of Del Playa Drive, the 6500 block of Trigo Road and between Del Playa Drive and Trigo Road on Camino Pescadero, Camino Del Sur and El Embarcadero Road.</p>\n<p>Cars parked on the 6500 block of El Nido Road and on the 6500, 6600 and 6700 blocks of Sabado Tarde Road do not need to be moved over this time period, but roadblocks will be placed on those blocks to prevent cars from entering and exiting.</p>\n<p><strong>UCSB</strong></p>\n<p>According to the A.S. Halloween website, visitors are not allowed to park on campus.</p>\n<p>Vehicles parked on campus without a matching permit are subject to a $300 citation and towing.</p>\n<p>Students with a Night &amp; Weekend (N&amp;W) Parking Permit will be able to park on campus from 11 a.m. on Friday to 7:30 a.m. on Wednesday. Lots 22, 18, 16, 30 and 38 will be the only lots open for parking over the weekend.</p>\n<p>N&amp;W permits purchased in the fall cost $52.50 plus a $5.95 shipping charge. Permits are sold year round, but students had to apply for a parking permit by Oct. 15 to have it shipped in time for the coming weekend. Each student may only purchase one permit.</p>\n<p>The only valid permits for overnight parking — between 5 p.m. and 7:30 a.m. — are special event permits, N&amp;W, Isla Vista Access permit for Lot 22 (IVA 22) or faculty and staff permits.</p>\n<p>IVA 22 is a valid permit for Lot 22.</p>\n<p>Only 100 of these permits were available for “community members, UCSB staff, faculty, and non-resident students,” according to the Associated Students’ Halloween tip website.</p>\n<p>Last year, Transportation &amp; Parking Services offered a 50 percent discount for the N&amp;W permits prior to the Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>Nestor Covarrubias, director of Transportation &amp; Parking Services, said they decided not to renew the discount this year because they believe the permit price is already fair.</p>\n<p>“The Night and Weekend parking permit is a good value, allowing access to campus for the entire academic year,” Covarrubias said in an email. “The equivalent cost to purchase daily passes for the Halloween period alone would come out to $32.”</p>\n<p>Transportation &amp; Parking Services has sold 354 N&amp;W permits this year. The department sold 465 permits by this time last year, Covarrubias said.</p>\n<p>According to Covarrubias, Transportation &amp; Parking Services issued 95 parking citations between Oct. 28 and Oct. 30 last year. He said 94 of the citations were issued at $48, and one was issued at $238 because the vehicle was parked in front of a fire hydrant.</p>\n<p><strong>GOLETA</strong></p>\n<p>According to Valerie Kushnerov, community relations manager for the City of Goleta, between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. Friday through Sunday, street parking will be limited to residents with parking permits for the weekend. Two such parking permits were sent to each Goleta household in preparation.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 26, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

Senator Kian Maalizadeh authored the resolution to provide funding for students unable to travel home because of financial issues. <em>Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kian Maalizadeh, transfer senator and fourth-year biology major, created the resolution on Dec. 8. Ilene Ochoa, an off-campus senator and fourth-year communication major, seconded the resolution, which was later passed through an email vote on Dec. 10.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email votes are usually used only in emergency situations, Maalizadeh said. Senators used an email vote because the fire grew quickly after their last planned meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the resolution, the Senate will take $5,000 from their unallocated fund which is made up of student fees, and a detailed list of what was purchased will be sent back to Associated Students (A.S.). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maalizadeh said the resolution was made intentionally vague because he anticipates that many  unforeseen problems could arise during the fire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he created the resolution because he wanted to show A.S.’s support for the students affected by the fire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of students were calling UC admin saying they couldn’t leave, they couldn’t afford to leave; they were stuck, basically in the pollution,” Maalizadeh said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said A.S. released polls asking students if they needed aid to get off campus, and the overall response was “yes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The deadline to request funds was 10:30 a.m. on Dec. 14 so that the Financial Crisis Response Team could process checks in a “timely manner,” according to Maalizadeh. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Senators posted on Facebook about the resolution and told students to email A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez by the deadline if they needed transportation funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Márquez forwarded the students’ full names and student identification numbers to the university’s Financial Crisis Response Team, which then decided how much money a student would be awarded for transportation on a case-by-case basis, Maalizadeh said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Out of the $5,000 that was allocated, $2,800 was used as of Dec. 14, according to Michael Miller, assistant vice chancellor for enrollment services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who responded by the 10:30 a.m. Thursday deadline were able to pick up checks at 3 p.m. from the BARC office, Miller said. Students who responded after that deadline but before 10:30 a.m. Friday can pick up their checks by 3 p.m. today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller said the amount of money given to students depended on their destination and was based off the cost of a Amtrak ticket. He explained that a student who needed to travel south to Los Angeles or San Diego was given approximately $40.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who needed to travel north to San Francisco or Sacramento were given approximately $100 for the fare, Miller said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 50 students received funding, according to Brooke Kopel, a college of letters and sciences senator and third-year political science major.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Thomas Fire has burned 252,500 acres and is 35 percent contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mandatory evacuations have occurred across Ventura and Santa Barbara counties and 972 structures have been destroyed.
