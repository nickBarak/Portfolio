Sciences Senators Ricardo Uribe and Xochitl Briseño first introduced a modification to Legal Code at the Feb. 6 Senate meeting that would codify the one-time exception process that Salari went through. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Referred to as </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Policy-36.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standing Policy 36</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the legislation would have updated Legal Code to clarify the consequences and proper procedures moving forward for senators “who [were] voted in to represent a certain sector of the student body but due to external circumstances no longer can identify with those constituents,” the policy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No longer “identify[ing] with those constituents” includes living off-campus when they were elected as on-campus senators or changing colleges as a collegiate senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Standing Policy 36, senators would have been allowed to continue serving in their positions if the Senate felt they were adequately “attending office hours, attending BCU meeting[s], attending senate meetings, and [fulfilling] their other senatorial duties outlined per legal code,” and granted them an exemption. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill was tabled for a week at the Feb. 6 meeting. All bills are required to be tabled for a week before they are voted on, per Legal Code.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the Feb. 13 meeting, several senators raised concerns about the Senate being the ones to grant an exemption, given that it is a partisan body. Standing Policy 36 was voted on and failed with nine yeses, ten noes and two abstentions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the Feb. 20 Senate meeting, Uribe and Briseno introduced another bill to update the eligibility section of Legal Code. This one, however, gave the power to grant exemptions to the Student Advocate General (S.A.G.), who runs for the position independently and is required by Legal Code to be nonpartisan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill also broadened the scope of who could receive exemptions, allowing for an elected official, including the S.A.G., to be granted an exemption for not meeting the eligibility requirements spelled out in Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this year’s S.A.G., Grecia Martinez, was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-04/s-a-g-martinez-found-in-violation-of-legal-code-by-a-g-safadi/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">found in violation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the very same portion of Legal Code by A.S. Attorney General Zeina Safadi, who released a statement on Feb. 26. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the statement, Safadi acknowledged that “the course of action regarding Ms. Martinez becomes unclear due to the fact that the requirements for elected officers start and end in that very article [of] the Legal Code.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ambiguity of the legal code on the Ms. Martinez’s case is simply a microcosm of the larger problem at hand with the text: countless incompletions and uncertain instructions that arise only when cases pertaining to such occur,” Safadi added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez maintained that she interpreted that portion of legal code as an expectation, and not an obligation, in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That bill was also </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/a-s-senate-tables-bill-to-clarify-consequences-for-elected-officials-who-dont-meet-eligibility-requirements/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tabled for a week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, per Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the Feb. 27 Senate meeting, the bill was tabled once again. Uribe said that Elections Board had reached out to him and Briseño, asking for clarification about the bill. Since neither of them could meet with the Board before the Senate meeting, they decided to postpone the vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, Uribe said he and Briseño have been unable to meet with Elections Board, particularly since all parties were busy with Spring 2019 elections. The bill has now essentially termed out, Uribe said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uribe said that he had no plans to introduce a new version of the bill at the 69th Senate’s last meeting this Wednesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt like I was the only senator who is really interested in fulfilling the bill,” Uribe said. “There were people who I knew who agreed, who would have voted for the bill and who would have definitely loved it, but just not enough people…. the way I saw it, there was not enough people to get it passed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uribe still believes that some version of this bill is necessary, and said that he hoped Senator-elect Daniel Segura-Esquivel, who he has been training, will pick up where he left off. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, Uribe said, a new bill would give senators the power to grant exemptions to executives, and vice versa, which would allow for A.S. to maintain a system of checks and balances. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he acknowledged the concerns other senators had raised about the Senate being partisan, Uribe said he didn’t believe it would be a problem because the vote would require a two-thirds majority, and one party typically does not win that many seats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without a clarification of the path forward for elected officials within A.S. who fail to meet the eligibility requirements, that portion of Legal Code will continue to be what several A.S. officials have referred to as a “gray area.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Without accountability measures in place, we have no doubt that UC will continue to take advantage of workers who have no legal recourse,” Iyengar said in the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In February 2019, the UC Office of the President </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/uc-will-offer-additional-payment-to-those-affected-by-ucpath/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">took its first steps towards addressing the issue</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of missed payments, offering varying amounts of money to approximately 750 workers who had been affected by UC Path. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate Bill 698, co-authored by Senator Connie Leyva and Senator Scott Wiener, takes a step beyond the offered compensation and would make it a requirement for the UC system to pay its workers on time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California law requires that employees be paid twice a month on designated “regular pay days”; workers classified as executive, administrative or professional employees can be paid once a month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If passed through the California State Assembly and signed by California Governor Gavin Newsom, the bill would require that university employees who are paid on a monthly basis be paid “no later than 5 days after the close of the monthly payroll period.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the bill would require the university to create payroll regulations for employees who are paid on a “more frequent basis.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Violating current California payment law results in a misdemeanor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the UC doesn’t pay workers “on time and on a regular payday,” employees can file a claim in state court or with the Labor Commissioner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, UC Path serves UC Berkeley, UC Los Angeles, UC Merced, UC Riverside, UCOP and UCSB. UC Regents plan to implement UCPath at the rest of the UC campuses over the next several years, according to the bill.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the May 30, 2019 version of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

transitioning into having full voting power during his second year. </span><em>Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil will join the current regent designate, UC San Diego doctoral student Hayley Weddle, in serving on the Regents board if he is approved at the July meeting. He will serve alongside Weddle when she succeeds the current student regent, UC Los Angeles doctoral student Devon Graves, for this upcoming year; following Weddle’s term, Muwwakkil will take over and serve as the voting regent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents is comprised of</span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/about/members-and-advisors/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 26 appointed and ex-officio members </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that govern the UC system. The UC student regent is a full-voting regent of the University of California and the only voting member on the board who is required to be a student at one of the UC campuses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The only real differences [between student regents and other appointed regents] is that they are closer to the student population, both in age and geographic proximity. The idea is that they might be able to leverage the student voice and kind of contextualize the policy decisions that are being made,” Muwwakkil said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil will spend the first year of his two-year term learning the ropes of the position before transitioning into having full voting power during his second year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The first year, you’re participating in all of the committee meetings and going to all of the talks, but you’re not voting — you’re functionally shadowing the student regent who’s appointed in their second year of the position,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A record 113 UC students applied for the position of the 2020-21 student regent, </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-student-regent-nominated-2019-20\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">compared to 40 who applied in the cycle before</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Muwwakkil attributes this to the previous student regents’ efforts to publicize the position and inform students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Regent Graves and Regent Weddle made a point to visit all of the campuses and to market the position space… and encouraging a lot of folks who would not have applied otherwise to engage in the process,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a member of the Black Graduate Student Association (BGSA) at UCSB and a first-generation transfer student, Muwwakkil said he took notice of the lack of representation of students of color, and more specifically, nontraditional students of color, in student governance and higher education in general. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the ways Muwwakkill addressed this issue was by helping to revive UCSB’s BGSA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Myself and a lot of other graduate students of color found that our numbers are quite low. We decided to… revitalize the existing infrastructure of the Black Graduate Student Association of UCSB,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil worked with David Stamps, a doctoral student in the Department of Communications, to reestablish the BGSA, and eventually served as the second BGSA president during the 2017-18 academic year. During this time, he began to look for more avenues to expand his advocacy work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, he reasoned the best way to make an impact while fulfilling his academic commitments was by serving as student regent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil initially applied for the position during the last application cycle but was passed over for Weddle. He will now be shadowing her as regent designate next year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil said Weddle focuses on advocating for the “basic rights of students” like “food insecurity, housing security, accessibility” as well as on other issues like Title IX regulations and sexual violence on college campuses.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to Weddle’s platform, Muwwakkil plans to bring attention to the challenges faced by nontraditional students.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we engage with leadership from each campus, we also have to be intentional to engage with students whose perspectives may very well not be represented by their leadership,” Muwwakkil said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Society does] this thing where we kind of focus in on like the 18-year-old, [and say] ‘Be stellar at 18 or no UC for you.’ I think this is a problem because there’s a lot of living that people do between the age of 18 and retirement. We need to validate the experiences of non-traditional students … within the classroom,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a transfer student from Los Angeles City College, Muwwakkil said his experience has shaped his views about accessibility for nontraditional students navigating higher education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you’re [a] first-generation student going through college, there’s a lot of guesswork that happens … You’re confused about the process, what it means to apply,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As regent designate, Muwwakkil said he first hopes to educate himself on the operations and inner workings of the Board of Regents and maneuvering the system, as well as pressing issues within the system and how these relate to students and their success.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m going to be doing a lot of fact finding and understanding what are the actual mechanisms by which things are done and accomplished; what are the prominent issues facing the UC and how the students build on their local campus level and the larger system,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During his tenure as student regent, Muwwakkil said he hopes to further the UC system’s aim in cultivating an environment that is conducive to the success of all students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Are there ways that all of these different types of students can engage in the huge bureaucracy that is the university? If that’s true for some and not for others, then we have some work to do.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

year.<em> </em></span><em>Cameron Hsieh / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plaintiff in the most recent case, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan Lee Reyes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> v. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of California Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is UC Santa Barbara UC Police Department officer Jonathan Lee Reyes. In the suit, Reyes alleges he was retaliated against for reporting misconduct in the department relating to the retention and promotion of an unqualified police trainee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that Reyes’ whistleblowing led UCPD Lieutenant David Millard and UCPD Sergeant Gregory Smorodinsky to block Reyes from receiving a promotion to higher positions and that the two gave Reyes an unfair poor performance review.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to an individual within UCPD who asked that their name not be used, Millard is currently at a training course at the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Academy; the individual provided photographic evidence to the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Millard was there and not on the UC Santa Barbara campus as of May 9. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada was unable to comment on whether or not Millard was at the FBI academy, but could confirm that he is still an active member of the UCPD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that UCPD “retaliated against other employees based on the same protected class [as Reyes].” The suit also alleges that UCPD failed to  “discipline other employees outside [Reyes’] own protected class as severely” for the same actions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes’ lawsuit is the latest of four lawsuits filed against the department since late last year, all of which allege that the plaintiffs were retaliated against for blowing the whistle on misconduct in the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other three suits </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-07/former-officer-sues-ucpd-alleges-racism-misconduct-and-conspiracy-throughout-department/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Doe v. UC Regents</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, filed in March 2019, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-03/breaking-ucpd-officers-sue-ucpd-members-for-alleged-mistreatment-after-reporting-sergeant/\">Michael Little and Tiffany Little v.

UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the complaint alleges that Millard repeatedly promoted a trainee officer from lower positions despite opposition from Reyes and others in the department who were concerned about the trainee’s performance. Reyes alleges he brought concerns forward to Millard multiple times, including when the trainee was first assigned to Reyes and later when Millard announced the trainee had completed Field Training Officer (FTO) training. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case alleges that Millard’s approval to promote the unqualified trainee created “a threat to the safety of the public and the University” and violated <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=832\">California Penal Code 832</a>, which states that “a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">peace officer shall satisfactorily complete an introductory training course.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The allegations in court documents begin in June 2017, when Reyes was assigned as an FTO with the trainee. Court documents say that after Millard announced in an email that the trainee will advance to the next phase, Reyes, along with several other officers, objected the promotion, pointing to “multiple evaluations by FTO’s [which] indicated that the trainee was failing,” court documents allege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite an FTO’s recommendation for the trainee’s termination and the trainee’s failure to pass a program from the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards Training (P.O.S.T.) — the body responsible for creating law enforcement training requirements — Lieutenant Millard “successfully released [the trainee] from FTO training,” court documents allege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes then allegedly emailed the region coordinator for P.O.S.T. to relay his concerns about the failing trainee. Millard later met with Reyes and accused him of “not following an order” to promote the trainee, court documents allege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In August 2017, Reyes was denied a promotion to corporal, despite being “better qualified for the position than other candidates selected for the position,” court documents state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, in September 2017, Reyes applied for a position as a sergeant but was again denied the promotion in March 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes alleges that he did not receive these positions, despite his qualifications, due to retaliation from Millard regarding the trainee. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit also alleges that Reyes’ poor performance review from 2018 was another result of the department’s retaliation, this time from Smorodinsky “under the direction of [Millard].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Court documents state “the review was very critical” and omitted “various positive things throughout the year.” Reyes submitted a grievance to the department “which detailed each point in his review that he felt was inaccurate or unwarranted,” and his review was later overturned in response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The allegations in the suit involve a handful of other officers as well, including former Police Chief Dustin Olson, former Assistant Chief Cathy Farley, Sergeant Gregory Pierce and Sergeant Rory Sheehey, who are named in the other cases as well. However, none of the aforementioned officers are being sued in Reyes’ case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three of the four cases filed since November 2018, including </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes v. UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, are represented by the same law firm, Richie Litigation, based in Los Angeles. Antonio Castillo, a lawyer handling the cases from Richie Litigation, said in an email that the three cases “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are exposing long-term systemic systems of bullying and the suppression of the advancement of minority police officers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ryan Smith, the plaintiff in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Doe v. UC Regents, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is the only officer of the five who worked with a different attorney, Peter Horton, to file his claim. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuits brought forward by Reyes, Signa and the Littles are steps toward addressing the department’s alleged misconduct, according to Castillo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That these brave officers have come forward and inspired many more to do so means that we finally have an opportunity to make real progress in changing how the UCSB Police Department operates,” Castillo said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the May 30, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
