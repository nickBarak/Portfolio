In 2011 and 2015, UCSB received the less prestigious Gold-level distinction, according to the League. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amelia Neptune, a representative from the League of American Bicyclists, said in an email to the Nexus that there were “a few weaknesses” from UCSB’s 2015 application, which is why the university was not awarded a Platinum distinction before. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[There was] </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the lack of bike share at the time (there was a program but it had five bikes total, as opposed to the 650-bike HOPR program that now exists) and the poor quality of many of the bike racks on campus, which have been upgraded or are still in the process of being upgraded and/or expanded,” Neptune said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The significant changes made over the last few years, including the addition of new biking paths and bike parking spots, led to UCSB achieving the new award, Neptune said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A major factor in UCSB earning Platinum this year [is] the outcomes they were able to show: 43% of students who live off campus use a bike to commute to campus, which is huge compared to what most schools see,” Neptune said. </span><b> </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the new improvements build upon the deep-rooted bike culture that has been present on campus for decades, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The presence of dedicated bike infrastructure, including 20,000 bike parking spots, 9 bike-only roundabouts, 3 bike-only underpasses, and the network of dedicated bike paths throughout the campus, [is] also a major factor [for the Platinum BFU designation].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jamey Wagner, manager of the Transportation Alternatives Program, said that UC Santa Barbara began to develop its bicycle system in the 1960s, stating that the campus has “continued bicycle infrastructure innovation for over 50 years” and that the A.S. Bike Shop has been in operation for over 45 years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wagner added that the HOPR Bike Share program, which launched at UCSB in 2018, has seen significant improvement since 2015, when UCSB was last assessed as a bike-friendly university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most recent data shows that, with the addition of hundreds of shareable bikes, the HOPR program now has 1000 semi-regular users, according to Wagner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, in the last four years, the UCSB Sustainability Program has been partnering with the A.S. Bike Committee to provide bike safety training and bike-lot clearing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student initiatives played the largest role [in achieving platinum status], this was aided by the diversity in spaces such as the Associated Students Bike Committee and the A.S. Bike Shop</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” Wagner explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neptune added that over the past year, the Sustainable Transportation Committee has been working on a master transportation plan for the campus, which includes improvements to bike infrastructure. This plan was included in UCSB’s application to become a bike-friendly university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new bike plan promises changes and improvements to infrastructure on campus and in I.V., Mo Lovegreen, director of sustainability on campus, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are still in the process of drafting this plan and it will take us the bulk of this academic year to complete it but the idea is that it would help AS BIKES identify areas that need improvement and provide a list of items that need to be addressed,” Lovegreen explained in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plan [looks] into the future and uses what has been thought of and creates what hasn’t been thought of.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91116\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91116\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/","id":1922,"author":{"id":54,"name":"Nidhi Satyagal"},"related":[1921,1920,1919],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":54,"name":"Nidhi Satyagal","biography":"Not available","articles":[1922,1946],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"To Silence the Voice of the Voiceless?","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CHecks-and-Balances1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CHecks-and-Balances1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It's hard being an athlete but it's only made harder when you have critics are constantly trying to silence your voice.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Fear, happiness, anxiety, shock.

The Cavs star also helped introduce Clinton during a rally held in Cleveland where he endorsed her a second time.</p>\n<p>Now the 45th president-elect of the United States, Trump mentioned the support he had received from Tom Brady and Bill Belichick during a rally in New Hampshire a day before the election.</p>\n<p>Brady had previously made a statement in favor of a Trump presidency and a Make America Great Again hat was seen in his locker over a year ago.</p>\n<p>Although the two athletes supported candidates who were on opposing sides, the fact that both were willing to take the steps necessary to use their influence during this year’s election is an important liberty that other athletes should be encouraged to take.</p>\n<p>Athletes have historically received criticism for taking stances on political issues. During the 1968 Summer Olympics, U.S. runners John Carlos and Tommie Smith famously did the Black Power salute in the medal ceremony, raising their black-gloved fists in the air while the national anthem played.</p>\n<p>The athletes were subsequently banned from the games, and upon returning home they found themselves, and their families, receiving death threats.</p>\n<p>The two Olympic runners never wavered from their protest, and just this year the pair supported another protest from a fellow athlete, Colin Kaepernick.</p>\n<p>The San Francisco 49ers quarterback has been kneeling during the playing of the national anthem in football games since the start of the 2016 season in protest of recent wrongdoings done to the black community in America.</p>\n<p>Fellow football players have joined Kaepernick in his protest during the national anthem, and the reason for his protest has inspired other demonstrations in other professional leagues.</p>\n<p>On July 9 and 10, several teams in the WNBA wore black shirts in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. They bore the names of victims Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. The teams also wore shirts in memory of the five victims of the Dallas shooting.</p>\n<p>The WNBA fined the three teams (the New York Liberty, the Indiana Fever and the Phoenix Mercury) $5,000 each, and each player was fined $500 for violating the league’s uniform policy.</p>\n<p>The WNBA later rescinded the fines and vouched support for the players’ protest, but the initial punishment is exactly the type of action that prevents and intimidates players from attempting to use their platform to make their political statements.</p>\n<p>No matter what the political views or stances are that athletes desire to use their platforms to advocate for, the leagues must commit to providing an environment for athletes to utilize their First Amendment rights and demonstrate if they choose to do so without fear of reprisal.</p>\n<p>Players like the ones in the WNBA, Colin Kaepernick and LeBron James are no different from the likes of celebrated athletic and cultural icons like Jackie Robinson, Muhammad Ali, Tommie Smith and John Carlos.</p>\n<p>These players from the past and present have used their platform and influence to evoke change, not because of a need to boost their own profile, but to serve the basic human desire to speak out against something that is unjust and unfair.</p>\n<p>These players deserve to be seen as people, not just athletes, who patriotically utilize their First Amendment rights to take a stand despite criticism from the public or even their own league.</p>\n<p>All athletes from across the country, whether at the professional, collegiate or high school level, deserve an environment conducive to exercise their constitutional rights.</p>\n<p>“In any protest, I think you make a statement to try and reach the far ends of the Earth. What better way to do it than if you’re in a sport,” Carlos said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 17, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74273\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/to-silence-the-voice-of-the-voiceless/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74273\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/to-silence-the-voice-of-the-voiceless/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/to-silence-the-voice-of-the-voiceless/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/to-silence-the-voice-of-the-voiceless/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/to-silence-the-voice-of-the-voiceless/","id":1921,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1920,1919,1918],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Cubs Win World Series, End 108 Years of Torment","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-11-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ap_16308175159360.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ap_16308175159360.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After 108 years, the curse is over and the Cubs are winners again.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_73821\" style=\"width: 591px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73821\" data-attachment-id=\"73821\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/cubs-win-world-series-end-108-years-of-torment/ap_16308175159360/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ap_16308175159360.jpg?fit=1500%2C1111&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1111\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ap_16308175159360\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ap_16308175159360.jpg?fit=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ap_16308175159360.jpg?fit=888%2C657&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-73821\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ap_16308175159360-1024x758.jpg?resize=581%2C430\" alt=\"David J.

The Cubs, having not won since 1908, and the Indians since 1948, gave both teams the intense motivation to push them to game seven. Each game, inning, and play has kept baseball fans across the nation glued to their televisions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leading by three at the top of the eighth inning, the Cubs had reason to feel confident, but leave it to the Indians to come back from behind when pressure is on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This has been the first World Series to be tied in the ninth inning since 1991 between the Twins and the Braves, according to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mlb.com.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> These two knock-out teams managed to keep it tied and send the game into extra innings, stirring up every Cubs and Tribe fan alike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here it was, the 10th inning that will go down in Cubs baseball history. Indians pitcher Bryan Shaw  intentionally walks Anthony Rizzo, a hitting all-star this post-season, as well as Addison Russell,  to prevent any chance of hits from these two. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Zobrist slammed double into left field, sending Albert Amora Jr. home to push the Cubs ahead. Miguel Montero, then singles, knocked Rizzo home for another run. The Cubs headed into the bottom of the 10th with just three outs standing between them and their first World Series title in over a century. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crowd has seen this scenario before in the eighth inning when the Indians were able to turn it around; the real question was would they be able to pull it off again in the 10th?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carl Edwards Jr., Cubs reliever, managed to snag two outs. But with one left, the Indians scored as right-handed hitter Rajai Davis smacked a line drive to center field. Mike Montgomery enters as the Cubs attempt to clench one last out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within two pitches, the Chicago Cubs had made history. It took every member of the team, both offensively and defensively, to achieve what this group has achieved, and the victory is oh so sweet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Zobrist, Cubs second baseman, and seasoned player, was named Series MVP after his hit in the 10th-inning of game seven that changed baseball history. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zobrist was most recently a Kansas City Royal and helped in winning the 2015 World Series. His presence on the field as a defender has made quite the impression, causing </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">usatoday.com</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to call him a “super utility player,” as well as his stellar record as a switch-hitter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mlb.com</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Cubs coaches and administrators alike have called Zobrist a professional and role model both on and off the field — both from his “work ethic” to “clubhouse professionalism.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A close runner-up would have been Rizzo as he played an enormous role in leading his team to victory, but the second baseman’s title was well earned. Ben Zobrist is a name no Cubs fan will ever forget. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This National League powerhouse team was chosen early in the 2016 season as a team to watch and has now surpassed all expectations and crushed all doubts. Congratulations to the 2016 World Series Champions, finally, the Chicago Cubs!</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73815\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/cubs-win-world-series-end-108-years-of-torment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73815\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/cubs-win-world-series-end-108-years-of-torment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/cubs-win-world-series-end-108-years-of-torment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/cubs-win-world-series-end-108-years-of-torment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/cubs-win-world-series-end-108-years-of-torment/","id":1919,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[1918,1917,1916],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“Our struggles as students are intertwined with the struggles of workers”: A.S.

Yang to write a letter to several UC institutions — including President Janet Napolitano, the UC Board of Regents and UC Labor Relations — to express support for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 3299’s (AFSCME 3299) contract demands, which include ending alleged “illegal outsourcing practices,” according to the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The UC continues to involve themselves in illegal outsourcing practices, which has affected over 10,000 individuals who work for the UC, one of the largest employers in California,” Off-Campus Senator Daniel Segura-Esquivel, the first author on the resolution, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that AFSCME has held </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-09/afscme-announces-strike-over-outsourcing-unfair-labor-practices/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">six</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> strikes in the past two years, and that “this is the fourth one dealing with unfair labor practices.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s workers on campus that help keep the school running, so I thought it was important to show our support for them,” Segura-Esquivel said in an interview.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that while the resolution directs the chancellor to write a letter supporting the strike, Yang is not required to do so.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to an email asking if he would write the letter, Yang said that “All of us at UC Santa Barbara recognize how extremely valuable our AFSCME colleagues are to our campus community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Systemwide negotiations with AFSCME 3299 are being handled by UC Office of the President, and this important issue is being discussed with our UC chancellors, our UC Regents, and our campus and UCOP colleagues,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution was seconded by Off-Campus Senator Racquel Almario, and was student-sponsored by Ana Fabian and Dylan Kupsh, affiliates with the United Student Labor Action Coalition Local 805. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students have a responsibility to be in solidarity because our struggles as students are intertwined with the struggles of workers,” Fabian said at the Senate meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution also condemns the possibility of police presence and “any form of university harassment” during the strike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME 3299, which represents more than 24,000 healthcare and service employees, filed six complaints against the UC in early November, alleging that the university is cutting costs by hiring outside contractors to do jobs typically conducted by union employees.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These [non-union] workers get paid significantly less. They don’t have any health care, they don’t have any protections so they can be fired any one day,” said, Gabriella Silva, an intern with AFSCME 3299. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Union-contracted workers in California make on average “12.9% more than non-union workers with similar demographic characteristics and working in similar industries,” according to the </span><a href=\"http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/union-effect-in-california-1/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley Labor Center</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which researches labor and employment. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC, however, believes the strikes are part of a strategy to increase AFSCME’s leverage in contract negotiations, according to UC spokesperson Andrew Gordon.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This strike notice does nothing to give employees the long-overdue agreement and raises they deserve,” Gordon said in an email.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The way to a deal is at the bargaining table — not on the picket lines — and should not come at the expense of patients, students, the University, and our communities. We will do everything we can to limit the strike’s negative impact,” he added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the complaints filed earlier this month, AFSCME additionally alleged that the UC secretly amended union contracts after contact with non-union vendors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB has comparatively fewer AFSCME workers than larger campuses with medical centers such as UC Los Angeles, according to Silva, who added that the smaller numbers of union workers will contribute to a relatively smaller protest next week.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s been less and less workers at each strike because not everyone can afford to take that whole day of wages off,” Silva said. “We anticipate more students than workers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC has increased spending on outsourcing on campuses by 23% since 2016, and 84% with medical centers, according to documents filed with the California legislature.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The number of AFSCME-represented service workers has also grown 16.8%, in the past five years, while the number of patient care workers has jumped 27.9%, Gordon said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada said that the university has plans in place to “mitigate any impacts” from the upcoming strike, but declined to provide further details. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91114\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-10/our-struggles-as-students-are-intertwined-with-the-struggles-of-workers-senate-endorses-upcoming-afscme-strike/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91114\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-10/our-struggles-as-students-are-intertwined-with-the-struggles-of-workers-senate-endorses-upcoming-afscme-strike/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-10/our-struggles-as-students-are-intertwined-with-the-struggles-of-workers-senate-endorses-upcoming-afscme-strike/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-10/our-struggles-as-students-are-intertwined-with-the-struggles-of-workers-senate-endorses-upcoming-afscme-strike/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-10/our-struggles-as-students-are-intertwined-with-the-struggles-of-workers-senate-endorses-upcoming-afscme-strike/","id":1920,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[1919,1918,1917],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
