We’re getting better at using solar and other alternatives. However, the urgency of the situation is real, because even as California and some other states have moved forward, the country has not,” Williams said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Motta emphasized Carbajal’s enthusiasm for the GND.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He was impressed by the aggressive agenda. He called Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and told her that he would like to be an original co-sponsor of the measure,” Motta said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the opening statements, the floor was opened for questions. The panel of four speakers included first-year environmental studies major Elena Salinas O’Toole, fourth-year sociology major Daniel Berchenko, Santa Barbara co-chair of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) Per Kristian and campaign manager for Jill Stein during the 2012 presidential election and UCSB sociologist Ben Manski. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They addressed questions regarding how common citizens could become involved in the movement, the subject of reparations, the specific policies of the GND and its intersectional nature.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manski elaborated on how the different approaches to the GND come together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s the liberal version which is technocratic, and focuses on a technological shift, there’s the progressive version which in my mind is the one that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has done such a great job of articulating, which deals with the need to transition economically, and focuses on specific industries, and then there’s the green party one, which is systemic reform,” Manski said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manski emphasized the necessity of voting rights and election reform in order to democratize the U.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kristian then highlighted the GND’s approach to mobilizing disenfranchised workers in middle America, similar to the original New Deal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Can you think of a better way to get working people on board than putting people to work doing the work that we need to do to … rebuild our environment?” Kristian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Berchenko spoke on the technological feasibility of the GND and how solutions already exist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The technological fixes have existed for decades. We know that we have the solar capacity, the wind capacity, the hydroelectric capacity to transition from carbon. We know that we have the alternative technologies that we’re going to need to do this. The only thing that we seem to be lacking is the political will,” Berchenko said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of particular significance to Salinas O’Toole is the stance that the GND takes with regard to wilderness and open spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I grew up in DC and there we have Rock Creek Park which is polluted and disgusting and for most people that’s the only nature that they’ve ever been exposed to. It’s gotten to the point where, in our society, it’s a privilege to have access to wilderness and I think that’s intrinsically wrong,” Salinas O’Toole said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I believe that is at the core of not understanding what’s at stake and preventing the people’s movement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel went on to describe how one could become involved in activism and grassroots movements to avoid succumbing to despair and apathy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of that is find a group. Don’t sit at home scrolling through Facebook reading about walruses throwing themselves off of cliffs … it’s a never-ending stream of negativity and you’re just gonna spiral down a hole,” Kristian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salinas O’Toole emphasized the necessity of having organizations that listen to youth and give them a voice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That was something that I was battling with a lot. I’d go to protests and I felt like I was super involved, but then there’d be this huge lack of response. Having platforms for young people to take hold of this issue that is affecting our generation more than any other generation is critical I think,” Salinas O’Toole said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the conclusion of the town hall, members in the audience were asked what they hoped would come out of the GND; people listed water use regulations, job guarantees, environmentally friendly investment opportunities and improvements in air quality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Berchenko said the two sides in the debate are not conflicts between urban and rural or liberals and conservatives, but rather the common person and corporate interests. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In Santa Barbara county there are five major oil projects going on right now. They are rebuilding the Plains All American Pipeline which spilled in 2015, on the same route, right next to it,” Berchenko said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s the people that are actually working that are being affected and that are going to be harmed by environmental issues, versus the small number of corporations and executives that are polluting the world. We can trace 70% of all emissions, since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, to 108 companies, 100 of which are still in operation. It’s always been the same people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Berchenko is hopeful about Sunrise Movement SB and the chance for change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of what’s exciting about Sunrise and what’s exciting about the opportunity that’s presented to us now is that a large number of very young people are getting involved in this for what’s potentially the first time. They were really galvanized by the 2016 election and by the political climate that we’re starting to see now,” Berchenko said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m excited about the history that it invokes and what it could be.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Sciences Senators Ricardo Uribe and Xochitl Briseño first introduced a modification to Legal Code at the Feb. 6 Senate meeting that would codify the one-time exception process that Salari went through. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Referred to as </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Policy-36.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standing Policy 36</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the legislation would have updated Legal Code to clarify the consequences and proper procedures moving forward for senators “who [were] voted in to represent a certain sector of the student body but due to external circumstances no longer can identify with those constituents,” the policy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No longer “identify[ing] with those constituents” includes living off-campus when they were elected as on-campus senators or changing colleges as a collegiate senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Standing Policy 36, senators would have been allowed to continue serving in their positions if the Senate felt they were adequately “attending office hours, attending BCU meeting[s], attending senate meetings, and [fulfilling] their other senatorial duties outlined per legal code,” and granted them an exemption. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill was tabled for a week at the Feb. 6 meeting.

Standing Policy 36 was voted on and failed with nine yeses, ten noes and two abstentions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the Feb. 20 Senate meeting, Uribe and Briseno introduced another bill to update the eligibility section of Legal Code. This one, however, gave the power to grant exemptions to the Student Advocate General (S.A.G.), who runs for the position independently and is required by Legal Code to be nonpartisan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill also broadened the scope of who could receive exemptions, allowing for an elected official, including the S.A.G., to be granted an exemption for not meeting the eligibility requirements spelled out in Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this year’s S.A.G., Grecia Martinez, was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-04/s-a-g-martinez-found-in-violation-of-legal-code-by-a-g-safadi/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">found in violation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the very same portion of Legal Code by A.S. Attorney General Zeina Safadi, who released a statement on Feb. 26. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the statement, Safadi acknowledged that “the course of action regarding Ms. Martinez becomes unclear due to the fact that the requirements for elected officers start and end in that very article [of] the Legal Code.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ambiguity of the legal code on the Ms. Martinez’s case is simply a microcosm of the larger problem at hand with the text: countless incompletions and uncertain instructions that arise only when cases pertaining to such occur,” Safadi added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez maintained that she interpreted that portion of legal code as an expectation, and not an obligation, in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That bill was also </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/a-s-senate-tables-bill-to-clarify-consequences-for-elected-officials-who-dont-meet-eligibility-requirements/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tabled for a week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, per Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the Feb. 27 Senate meeting, the bill was tabled once again. Uribe said that Elections Board had reached out to him and Briseño, asking for clarification about the bill. Since neither of them could meet with the Board before the Senate meeting, they decided to postpone the vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, Uribe said he and Briseño have been unable to meet with Elections Board, particularly since all parties were busy with Spring 2019 elections. The bill has now essentially termed out, Uribe said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uribe said that he had no plans to introduce a new version of the bill at the 69th Senate’s last meeting this Wednesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt like I was the only senator who is really interested in fulfilling the bill,” Uribe said. “There were people who I knew who agreed, who would have voted for the bill and who would have definitely loved it, but just not enough people…. the way I saw it, there was not enough people to get it passed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uribe still believes that some version of this bill is necessary, and said that he hoped Senator-elect Daniel Segura-Esquivel, who he has been training, will pick up where he left off. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, Uribe said, a new bill would give senators the power to grant exemptions to executives, and vice versa, which would allow for A.S. to maintain a system of checks and balances. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he acknowledged the concerns other senators had raised about the Senate being partisan, Uribe said he didn’t believe it would be a problem because the vote would require a two-thirds majority, and one party typically does not win that many seats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without a clarification of the path forward for elected officials within A.S. who fail to meet the eligibility requirements, that portion of Legal Code will continue to be what several A.S. officials have referred to as a “gray area.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

News Editor Katherine Swartz to discuss his work this past year, his thoughts on how young people should get involved in their communities and what comes next for him.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read the Q&amp;A below: </span></i></p>\n<p><b>Why did you decide to come to speak at UCSB?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I look at California…. there’s a lot of love from March for Our Lives in California, for many students especially. We go to UC Irvine all the time, or we did over the election, because that’s where a lot of young people can have the largest impact. I wanted to come and speak at UCSB because you know, it’s a cool school. There’s a lot of youth here that can have a big impact on elections, [who can] vote for morally just leaders that care about us. </span></p>\n<p><b>When did you first hear about the Isla Vista tragedy? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I first heard about [the Isla Vista 2014 shooting]… I think I was relatively young. There’s been so many shootings in California [and] as I’m sure many people realize, they kind of all end up coming together in our minds, which is horrible because they shouldn’t in the first place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I can say is that [the Isla Vista 2014 shooting] proves that we don’t just need states like California with stronger gun laws. We need states all over, all around the county, with stronger gun laws. We need support for victims in the first place, and for people to remember the fact that oftentimes, people don’t [support victims]… If we say Santa Fe, Texas, where there was a shooting right after Park[land] and then a couple months after, and no one remembers it. There’s a problem there. </span></p>\n<p><b>Have you spoken at any other schools that have experienced shootings in the past? What’s that like, that they’ve gone through what you previously went through?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t know if I’ve spoken at any schools that have gone through shootings in the past, I can’t remember. I’m sure there’s been individual shootings that have happened on various campuses that I’ve been at, [and there are] individuals that have been affected by gun violence in the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing I always ask, is I ask everybody to raise their hand that’s in the crowd that’s been affected by gun violence. There’s an unbelievable number of hands that go up. It’s always really hard because you realize, what I’ve realized in doing this work, is that it’s not just one community that’s traumatized by gun violence, that goes through mass shootings. It’s literally everywhere in the United States that go through everyday shootings where kids are lost on a daily basis. People are lost in mass shootings, suicides, every day, as a result of easy access to firearms. </span></p>\n<p><b>Can you walk me through some of the work you’ve been doing in the past, just an overview of that? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So the past year, a week after the shooting at my school, we went out with one message and that was: vote. Vote not for Democrats or Republicans, but morally just leaders that care about kids and young people dying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s what we focused on. We went out and… we registered thousands of young people to vote. And then after that we did a bus tour around the country, some letter writing, but more nationally…  [We] went to congressional districts where young people could have the largest impact on elections, then went to those congressional districts, registered voters, had town halls, formed a chapter there and got people active and involved in their community. We were able to vote out more NRA-backed politicians than ever before in American history. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of that, the NRA is kind of falling apart at the seams right now. That’s in part because of some of the work that we’ve been doing as well… the one question I always have is how the hell is the NRA a nonprofit, when they take millions of dollars in contributions from gun manufacturers on an annual basis. The way I think about it is, imagine if big tobacco companies that benefit from selling as many cigarettes as possible and then end up causing cancer, was a nonprofit. And that’s what the NRA is basically – [it is] violence in this county and around the world at this point. They’re expanding a lot. </span></p>\n<p><b>With the recent kind of falling apart, more and more, of the NRA, what will you and the others keep doing moving forward?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re focusing a lot more on what we’re fighting for. We’re focusing on how we’re fighting for peace in our communities. The fact that we live in one of the most violent countries in the world, being a more developed country, but still being extremely violent, [seeing] everyday acts of gun violence and shootings on a daily basis is a problem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also in the fact that we’re complicit in gun violence around the world. When I’m in California and places that are further south along the Mexico border, [what] I think about a lot of the time is – in Florida we don’t have this, because we don’t border Mexico – but in a lot of southern states like Texas, Arizona, and so on and so forth, do, and I think about the fears like the Trump Administration tries spreading about asylum seekers coming to the border from Guatemala and Honduras. The fact that they don’t talk about how literally we give a lot of guns </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> most of the guns that are used to kill civilians in Guatemala and Honduras or families that are caught in the crossfire as a result of the war on cocaine that the United States is trying to fight there </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are American-made guns that we’re complicit in. And then when these people, essentially refugees, start coming to our border, fleeing violence that we’re complicit in, and we tell them to go back, we’re committing an act of genocide. </span></p>\n<p><b>What made you decide to take a gap year to keep continuing this activist work for the past year? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wanted more time to heal. I wanted more time to speak to as many students across the country as possible. I also know that I would be extremely bothered by being in school. If I was in school during the election, I [would have] felt like I failed and I wasn’t doing as much as I could. So I took that gap year to work as much on the election as possible. </span></p>\n<p><b>So now that you’re starting school in the fall and you’ll be a full time student again, what are your plans moving forward with your work? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just to continue pushing. Not so much fight against something per se anymore, like we fought a lot against the NRA, which is a major part of this problem, but shifting our focus on what we’re actually fighting for in the future, which is a peaceful, nonviolent or significantly less violent America, where people don’t have to worry about whether or not they’re going to go through a shooting at their school. People won’t have to worry where an exit is in their classroom or a movie theater or anywhere else where shootings have happened, and nobody has to worry about living through a drive-by shooting or active everyday gun violence as millions of kids across the United States do on a daily basis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hopefully what I hope we can do is start [to] fund programs that use community based violence intervention, that hire former convicts. I’ve [looked at] the criminal justice system and [seen how] oftentimes [people] have caused violent acts or even killed someone, and reform themselves after going through the criminal justice system for 30 odd years or some odd years and come back and stop kids from going down the same path they’re going down, without incarcerating more youth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We realized that if putting more people in prison actually reduced gun violence in America, we wouldn’t be having his problem right now, with the highest prisoner population in the world. </span></p>\n<p><b>What shape will this work take now into the future? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think what it has to take is young people running for office and young people voting and not thinking of themselves as Democrats or Republicans, but thinking about what’s moral and right in the first place. Thinking about an America where we don’t have to constantly be so divided along party lines, but [where] we’re united against all forms of injustice and we’re all fighting against those forms of injustice, whether it be economic oppression, racial oppression, or any other form of injustice, because what gun violence is is a measure of injustice a community faces. The more gun violence a community has, the more injustice it actually faces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, like in Isla Vista or Parkland, both of those shootings are a result of political injustice… They should’ve been stopped way before Columbine, right? We should have put laws in place. When there [were] the first mass shootings in American history, we could have stopped these things in the first place, but they didn’t because we have politicians on both sides of the political aisle that are complicit in gun violence. We have to unite and rally for morally just leaders that care about gun violence and care about people dying, which is sad. It really is. But that’s what we have to do. We need young people to realize there’s extreme, large amounts of power that is not utilized at a local level, especially in local politics where much of it is essentially an elected cocktail party. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From what I’ve seen, people don’t run because they want to actually help their community; they run because they liked the title and the status that it brings them. We need to change that. We need kids to go out there and represent their community and realize that, even on our school boards </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> there’s many places across the United States where you don’t even have to be 18 to run for school board, there is no age limit </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and you can do that. There’s inherently a problem if we say we live in a representative democracy and we aren’t accurately represented by age, like how old congress is… There’s so many young people that are not represented in this county that only will be represented when they run for office themselves. </span></p>\n<p><b>What would you say to students who feel passionately about this issue and want to get involved but don’t know how and can’t necessarily run for office? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a chapter on the UCSB campus here, the March for Our Lives chapter, that does voter registration. We work on candidate town halls. We work on a multitude of subjects along with also just learning about gun violence and talking about gun violence, where students can come together and work around an issue. You can get politically involved without having to run for office, but also make a change in [your] community. </span></p>\n<p><b>As Isla Vista remembers five years since our tragedy, where do you hope the national conversation on gun violence will be five years from now?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope [gun violence] doesn’t have to exist anymore because we [will] create actions that are in place and stop something like Isla Vista or Parkland, or any active everyday gun violence from occurring every again… I think in the future people are going to have this </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for lack of a better word </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ‘come to Jesus’ moment where they’re like, ‘How the hell did it takes us this long to actually respond to this issue, and how many people do we let die when we realized this was an issue but chose to do nothing about it?’ Because the thing that’s stopping us from ending gun violence and stopping all forms of shootings isn’t whether or not we care. It’s not whether or not young people in Isla Vista or Parkland, or Jamaica, Queens </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where my friend Erica Ford works </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or anywhere else, care. It’s not about Americans caring.

We do have a large community, and hopefully that moves at least one person to stay in college. We would have another queer person of color being able to graduate college, when statistically speaking, it is already hard to get in here, and even harder to [graduate],” said Ricardo Uribe, a former Letters and Science senator with the 69th Senate.</p>\n<p>Photos of the event captured by <em>Nexus</em> photographers can be viewed below:</p>\n<p></p><p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-88624-1-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-10.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88615\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-10.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-9.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88614\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-9.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88620\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-2.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88622\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-4.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1203\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88621\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-3.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-12.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88617\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-12.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-11.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88616\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-11.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-8.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88613\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-8.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88612\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-7.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-6.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88611\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-6.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
