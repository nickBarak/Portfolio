Waltz, who is the co-creator and head of the organization’s UCSB chapter, said that the club’s main focus is to run sales events that include guest speakers and panels. VSS also hosts instructional workshops and invites spokespeople from companies like Procore and Tesla, who speak to students about what it’s like to work in sales after college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, while the club offers a number of resources, Waltz explained that the program’s singular goal is to help “fellow Gauchos get a foot in the door in an increasingly competitive job market.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While interning for VSS this past summer, Waltz met the people who would soon work with him to bring his idea for the Collegiate Sales Certification (CSC) program to life. These other interns went on to set up CSC programs at their own schools too: UC Berkeley student Michael Williams became head of the UC Berkeley chapter, Shannon Chau, head of the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo chapter and JennaRae DeMaio, head of the San Diego State chapter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waltz said that he is adamant about making sure that all of the program’s events hold a purpose and provide helpful tools and information to students. But in terms of obstacles, exposure and consistency are big ones, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Being that [this] is a new campus org … having that momentum is so key to really keeping a club going,” Waltz said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The coronavirus pandemic, however, has put a hold on the club’s meetings and workshops. To accommodate this change, Waltz said that he and his team are working to adapt the in-person workshops that were scheduled for spring into an online format.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Waltz, the program functions on three main pillars: structuring an opportunity, salesforce certification and cold-calling tactics. The first focuses on creating sales opportunities, invoking responses and cadence structure — using language to convince customers to open up, creating an opportunity to make a sale. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second pillar entails creating a new contact and taking them all the way from new lead to opportunity and close. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third pillar is the cold-calling skill, where students practice nearly 200 cold calls to familiarize themselves with the process.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the program is designed for students to pick and choose what modules and workshops they want to complete, they “don’t have to do the entire thing,” Waltz said, adding that modular learning eliminates the hassle of having to sit through workshops that aren’t of interest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want this club to be something that can benefit the entirety of the UCSB student body. My vision [is to make] sure that us Gauchos are that much better prepared to go out into the real world and have that competitive edge,” Waltz said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93733\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/ucsb-fourth-year-launches-collegiate-sales-certification-program/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93733\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/ucsb-fourth-year-launches-collegiate-sales-certification-program/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/ucsb-fourth-year-launches-collegiate-sales-certification-program/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/ucsb-fourth-year-launches-collegiate-sales-certification-program/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/ucsb-fourth-year-launches-collegiate-sales-certification-program/","id":1815,"author":{"id":256,"name":"KJ Clay"},"related":[1814,1813,1812],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":256,"name":"KJ Clay","biography":"Not available","articles":[1815,3351,3377],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"“I didn’t have any time to say goodbye to anybody”: UCSB Students Lament A Senior Year Cut Short","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-03-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CS8A0200.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CS8A0200.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"For the UCSB class of 2020, and for classes of 2020 worldwide, the loss of an in-person spring quarter and the presence of the coronavirus pandemic has thrown their lives into uncertainty.

That’s not going to happen for us,” said Talia Chalhoub, a biopsychology major who will also be graduating with a certificate in technology management. “The fact that [we] can’t walk into Campbell Hall ever again … You can’t just go sit outside at Cajé anymore.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are people that I’m never going to see again,” she added. “I’m pretending that all this has given us is an extra week at home rather than taking away any time we have remaining.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chalhoub, who also has a sister graduating from San Diego State University with the class of 2020, said she hopes to return to I.V. during spring quarter. She pays nearly $1,000 a month to live in I.V., and unlike the thousands of UCSB students who lived on-campus and were given the option to sever their dorm leases, it isn’t as easy to back out for </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-ucsb-students-grapple-with-i-v-leases-after-university-strongly-recommends-moving-home/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vistans</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Chalhoub also lives in a house with 13 housemates, which she said can make it difficult to navigate the logistics of online classes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know some professors might be recording [lectures] and putting them online, in which case you could just put in your headphones and you’ll be fine anywhere. But other professors are having you log on at 9 a.m. during regular class period,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If I have a 9 a.m. and [my roommates] have 9 a.m.s and it’s a different class, are we supposed to sit in the same room? How are we supposed to participate if the sound is too loud?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chalhoub is one of thousands of UCSB students who are grappling with this unprecedented situation. The university is actively encouraging students to stay away from I.V. if they have already left for their hometowns — warning that the coronavirus can spread quickly in the packed college town — but some seniors are grappling with how to handle their last quarters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do they stay in what has now become a “ghost town,” as put by cultural anthropology major Alex Buckley, or do they return to their hometowns and say goodbye to I.V.?  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buckley, who is immunocompromised and works a full-time job while also taking classes, said she was initially excited when she found out that UCSB was transitioning to remote instruction for spring quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I thought, okay, this might be a great idea. I’m not going to have to worry about going into class. But then once it actually hit me that I wasn’t going to be able to have an actual, last quarter on campus … it made me really sad,” Buckley said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t have any time to say goodbye to anybody. Or even realize that my last day of class, last quarter, was the last class I would ever take on campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buckley said going home would be easier for her than for her peers, because her parents live in Santa Barbara. But her I.V. landlord “already told us that he’s not letting anybody out of their lease.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t have any choice but to stay [in I.V.],” she said. “I would prefer to move and get out of I.V. since there’s nothing here and nothing open anymore.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said she considered subletting but hasn’t been able to find anyone actively trying to move into I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people, instead, are trying to get out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Walking around, Isla Vista is such a ghost town,” she said. “It’s really weird and super quiet. There’s no cars on the street, everyone I know has left and it’s a super weird, eerie feeling.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For seniors who have already left for their hometowns, such as for English major Jasmine Garcia, their lives are up in the air — it’s unknown if they will be able to return to I.V. and carry out their senior traditions, or how they will handle remote classes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garcia, who transferred to UCSB in Fall Quarter 2018, said this next quarter is going to be difficult for her to manage because she won’t have access to in-person campus resources such as Campus Learning Assistance Services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[I have to] become independent and find my own ways to get my essays revised,” she said. “I’m an English major, and [this] makes me feel like I don’t have any other support at the moment.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that it felt like her life “completely froze for a second” when she found out that Spring Quarter 2020 would be conducted remotely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a transfer, this “leaves me with one and a half years [at UCSB],” Garcia said. “I miss interacting with people and finding new connections … that was the number one thing I actually enjoyed the most [at UCSB].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Garcia, UCSB senior Sierra Hastings has also returned to her hometown. But Hastings finds herself in a unique situation for her last quarter; she’s in the Bachelor of Fine Arts in Theater program, along with nine other people in her senior class — a program that is “a struggle” to teach online. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hastings said that her professor has been checking in with her class but noted that they’re “at the same kind of loss, like, ‘Oh my god, how are we going to teach theater and dance on a computer?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s going to be a different quality than what we would get from being in a classroom.
