When you have Tom Brady and Bill Belichick, though, you’re great no matter what year it is.<br>\nAll the fuss about Deflategate hasn’t slowed New England down one bit, and the Tom Brady Revenge Tour is in full effect. The old man is third in QB rating, first in yards per game and has his team leading the NFL in point differential (49). Did I mention he’s a two-time MVP, three-time Super Bowl MVP and four-time champ that shows no Peyton Manning-like signs of slowing down?<br>\nThe receiving corps of Rob Gronkowski, Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola has gotten the job done, while solid production from shifty running back Dion Lewis has kept the Patriots offense in full throttle.

Anderson doesn’t look like the game-changing force he was in the later parts of 2014, and other than a 72-yard TD scamper last week — Ronnie Hillman still has much to prove.<br>\nDefense and Manning’s legendary track record keep the Broncos in the conversation for Super Bowl contenders for now, but we’ll see how long that lasts.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2072591840\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65101\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64767\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-22/nfl-round-up-week-2-review/panthers/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png?fit=1280%2C696&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,696\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"panthers\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png?fit=250%2C136&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png?fit=888%2C483&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-64767 alignleft\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png?resize=153%2C83\" alt=\"panthers\" width=\"153\" height=\"83\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png?resize=250%2C136&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png?resize=1024%2C557&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 153px) 100vw, 153px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>#6 Carolina Panthers</strong><br>\nThere were two things we kept hearing about the Panthers offense coming into the season: their lack of depth at receiver and Jonathan Stewart’s new role as the lead back. The receiving corps still isn’t that good and Stewart has been disappointing to say the least, yet Cam Newton has still managed to keep his team right there alongside Atlanta atop the NFC South.<br>\nIt might just be a matter of time before the Panthers show their true colors, as it seems pretty clear Cam isn’t ready to make a deep playoff run until he’s got a little more experience and a lot more help, but for now, Carolina can bask in its exciting potential.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

A remorseful dispute that led to bloodshed, the city of New Orleans grieves the loss of a local father, athlete, and hometown hero in Will Smith.</p>\n<p>William Raymond Smith III’s contributions to the Crescent City have been steady since his first day in a New Orleans uniform. As the 18<sup>th</sup> overall selection in the first round of the 2004 NFL Draft, Head Coach Sean Payton had high hopes for the 6-3 defensive end to develop into one of the elite rookies of his class.</p>\n<p>Just trailing AP Defensive Rookie of the Year and eventual teammate Jonathan Vilma, Smith let his capabilities speak for itself recording 59 tackles, 7.5 sacks, and a team-high six fumbles in his first year on the defensive line.</p>\n<p>Overcoming the painful aftereffects of Hurricane Katrina, Smith’s leadership in the trenches also permeated through the needy streets of New Orleans. As a captain on the Saint’s defensive front and a community leader, Smith helped revitalized a discouraged New Orleans’ fan base, proving that they were a spirited team and city that could fall and get right back up.</p>\n<p>A core part in the Saint’s 13-3 record and Super bowl XLIV run in 2009, Smith’s presence was essential in providing a pulse for his socially stricken Louisiana team.</p>\n<p>This sense spirit will be one of many characteristics missed with the tragic passing of the 34-year old defensive end. An individual who inspired progress both on and off the field, Smith brought a vital resurgence of pride in his New Orleans neighborhood.</p>\n<p>While this swelling issue of professional athlete’s lives being cut short, Smith’s unethical death and other fellow athletes that have fallen like Sean Taylor, Chris Henry, and Brian McNair serve a purpose in showcasing the delicateness of this present life.</p>\n<p>While the presence of Will Smith fades into the distance, his memory and passion on and off the field remain intact.</p>\n<p>Smith and his wife Racquel have three children: Winter Chase Smith, William J.

\r\n</script> \n<p>With the 2016 WNBA Draft set to take place tonight at 7 p.m. ET and the regular season to tip-off on May 14, marking the league’s 20th anniversary, it is time we all appreciate a league that has been somewhat of an outcast despite its improvements both on and off the court.</p>\n<p>Although the league is made up of just 12 teams, the WNBA is home to an array of star players that are helping the league expand its platform.</p>\n<p>Players such as reigning WNBA MVP Elena Delle Donne, reigning Defensive Player of the Year Brittney Griner, Maya Moore, Diana Taurasi —who is set to return after taking a year off to play overseas — and a plethora of other players have instilled a level of talent that have heightened the game of women’s basketball.</p>\n<p>Proof of the game’s improvement was exemplified at the game’s highest stage of the 2015 WNBA Finals in which the series between the Minnesota Lynx and Indiana Fever went to a five-game series for the first time since 2009.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Minnesota became the fourth franchise in WNBA history to win at least three titles, each of which have been won during the tenure of Moore, who has three rings in just five years of being in the league.</p>\n<p>Say what you want, but winning a championship — regardless of gender — is difficult in any sport.</p>\n<p>Coveted within the world of sports is the label of a franchise becoming a “dynasty.” A term commonly associated with teams such as the New England Patriots, Chicago Blackhawks and potentially the Golden State Warriors in the future, it’s a sign of elite status that hasn’t been of much usage in confirming the historic moments throughout WNBA history.</p>\n<p>However, helping bring that elite prominence to women’s basketball has been the dominance of Head Coach Geno Auriemma and the Connecticut Huskies.</p>\n<p>The ceiling of the WNBA can only ascend as tonight’s draft welcomes new talent that will entail a substantial presence of players hailing from a university that has produced the most No. 1 overall picks in WNBA history at four (the last being Moore in 2011) and the most players on active rosters at 14: UCONN.</p>\n<p>Set to grace the stage in the first round — possibly in historic fashion —as the top three picks in tonight’s draft are the consensus No. 1 overall pick: forward Breanna Stewart, guard Moriah Jefferson and forward Morgan Tuck.</p>\n<p>Each were a part of the Huskies’ 2015-16 team that recently won its 11th national championship in program history.</p>\n<p>Stewart is the only player in college basketball history to win four national championships and helped UCONN become the first NCAA Division I women’s basketball team to win four consecutive titles.</p>\n<p>At the helm of UCONN’s women’s basketball program for 31 years and boasting an 11-0 record in national championship matchups, Auriemma and his team have recently caught a lot of flak for making the game “unentertaining” and “unfair.”</p>\n<p>What was once admiration seems to have become boredom, but isn’t winning and being the best a priority in sports? Certainly the comradery and relationships formed on the team are of importance as well, but how can anyone be truly mad at a coach and a program that has mastered the art of winning and only enhanced the game of women’s basketball?</p>\n<p>As sports fans, we constantly support and glorify the three-peat championships of Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and the powerhouse collegiate programs within college sports. Let’s be honest — how many of you prior to reading this article knew that the Houston Comets, no longer an official team of the WNBA since 2008, won the league’s first four championships?</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, what would be the problem if Delle Donne’s suggestion of lowering the rims received approval? While all ideas and reforms can’t be accepted, maybe take the NFL route and perform a trial run for a season but don’t just rule it out like many have.</p>\n<p>It’s this divide within men’s and women’s sports that has led us to undermine the history that has taken place within women’s basketball, especially the WNBA.</p>\n<p>Forming an appreciation for the WNBA is no sudden process, but it is definitely a possible one that has given us an opportunity beginning with tonight’s draft through an October finish.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 19 of April 14, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69853\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/wnba-too-great-not-to-shine-2016-draft-tonight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69853\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/wnba-too-great-not-to-shine-2016-draft-tonight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/wnba-too-great-not-to-shine-2016-draft-tonight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/wnba-too-great-not-to-shine-2016-draft-tonight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/wnba-too-great-not-to-shine-2016-draft-tonight/","id":1984,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1983,1982,1981],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
