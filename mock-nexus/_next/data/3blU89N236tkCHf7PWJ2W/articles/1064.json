We love playing here, we love the fans and we have to continue to make sure we stay undefeated at home.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four Gauchos hit double-figures as freshman facilitator Amadou Sow was the pulse of the SB attack with a career-high 22 points and nine rebounds from 10-18 shooting, and he came out firing with six of the first eight Gaucho points in the game.  Sophomore guard JaQuori McLaughlin and Davis each scored 12 points in the contest, and in the back court McLaughlin also added five assists with zero turnovers and two takeaways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a swipe from McLaughlin at 14:26, the sophomore pushed his tempo, split defenders and cut to the rack before a swift kick-out pass to Davis who knocked down a triple from the far corner to put UCSB up 11-6.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although UCSB pulled ahead early, Riverside battled back behind a sharp three-ball attack spearheaded by junior guard Dikymbe Martin. Down 23-18 with seven minutes to play in the half, Martin corralled his own miss and pulled up with a teardrop in the restricted area to cut it to a one-possession game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After forcing a miss from UCSB on the other end, Highlanders’ redshirt sophomore guard Dominick Pickett nabbed another offensive rebound on the attacking half of the floor with a split-second look back out to Martin who drilled a right-wing jumper from behind the arc to knot it up at 23 apiece.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rebounding was huge for the Highlanders who led at the half 34-32 following 18 boards before the break and a +4 rebound-margin against the top team on the boards in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the first half belonged to UCR, the Gauchos came to play in the second with a 7-0 run to open up behind five points from Ramsey in the first two minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, Riverside continued to fight. The three ball was working for the Highlanders who had five treys in the second, including a smooth stroke from sophomore forward Ajani Kennedy who tied the game up at 46-46 with 13:37 to play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both teams traded threes over the next five-minute frame before Ramsey put his foot down and ultimately took over. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Riverside up 56-53, Gaucho senior forward Jarriesse Blackmon cut to the hoop and floated under the basket before firing a pass to Ramsey in the corner who nailed one from deep to tie it up at 56.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the ensuing possession, Ramsey received an outlet pass from Sow and barreled coast-to-coast with a spin in the lane to draw the contact and count the bucket.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When it’s time to finish the game or when my team needs a spark, I have to pick my energy up,” expressed Ramsey after his 20-point performance. “Whether that’s defensively or offensively, I try to do whatever it takes for the team.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From that point on, the Gauchos didn’t look back as McLaughlin delivered an alley-oop from 35-feet out to Sow at the basket who threw it down and put the nail in the coffin to hand the Highlanders their 12th loss of the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB sits in a tie for first place in the Big West with UC Irvine and Cal State Northridge after a pair of conference games, while Riverside dropped to sixth following a couple of heartbreaking losses to open Big West play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos take to the road for a three-game stretch with their first Big West Conference away matchup at UC Davis next Thursday with tip-off scheduled for 7 p.m. at The Pavilion. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Although Hawaii made a comeback, scoring one run in the seventh, a double play from Santa Barbara ended the game.</p>\n<p>“We got on a roll and the ball looked super big,” Clark said. “They just couldn’t catch us. Everyone was finding a hole.”</p>\n<p>With the series victory, UCSB improves to 30-18 overall and 10-5 in the Big West, just three games behind first-place Long Beach State. Hawaii dropped to 20-24 overall and 5-10 in conference.</p>\n<p>“[The series win] keeps us in the hunt. We’re taking care of what we need to without having to rely on other people,” Galicinao said. “We just need to stay within striking distance until that last weekend [when UCSB plays LBSU].”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s doubleheader featured two nail-biters as the two teams combined 34 runs in 17 innings of play.</p>\n<p>Game two swung the Rainbow Wahine’s way. Earning the 9-8 victory in nine innings of play, Hawaii jumped out to a 6-2 lead in the fourth. After adding two more runs in the seventh, the Gauchos needed an incredible seventh inning. Santa Barbara delivered, playing small ball and moving runners with six singles to score six runs in the inning.</p>\n<p>However, the effort would fall short as junior first baseman Leisha Li’ili’i hit a home run to even the series at 1-1. It was her second homer of the game. Li’ili’i ranks second in the Big West in homers with her total now at 14 on the year.</p>\n<p>Hawaii, the team that leads the league in home runs during conference play, improved to 12-4 when they hit two or more home runs.</p>\n<p>“The heart lineup that had been hitting home runs came up in the seventh,” Galicinao said. “I’ve been a little hard on [junior pitcher Shelby Wisdom] this weekend because she’s had better days than she’s shown this weekend.”</p>\n<p>Despite playing both games on Saturday at Hawaii’s tempo, Santa Barbara was able to edge out the Rainbow Wahine in a high-scoring battle in game one, winning 9-8 in eight innings.</p>\n<p>The offensive battle featured a close, see-saw game the entire way, but UCSB once again had to come back from behind in the seventh. Down two runs with one runner on base and two outs, Brucelas hit a home run to left center field, her fifth of the season.</p>\n<p>Going into the eighth, Hawaii’s freshman centerfielder Lindsey Willmon scored on a home run, but the Gauchos answered right back. Wisdom singled before sophomore catcher MeShalon Moore homered to left field to take the series opener. It was Moore’s first home run of the year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 28, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55066\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-win-rubber-match-against-hawaii-to-take-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55066\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-win-rubber-match-against-hawaii-to-take-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-win-rubber-match-against-hawaii-to-take-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-win-rubber-match-against-hawaii-to-take-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-win-rubber-match-against-hawaii-to-take-series/","id":1061,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1060,1059,1058],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Goes For Sweep Against League’s Worst UC Riverside Hoping to Remain in Title Race","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Softball_vsHawaii-DustinHarris-04272014-07.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Softball_vsHawaii-DustinHarris-04272014-07.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos have won nine of their last 11 games.

If Cal Poly can steal a game or two and Santa Barbara can earn three wins, the Gauchos put their fate in their own hands for next weekend.</p>\n<p>“We know our goal is to sweep this weekend,” junior utility DeJanee Moore said. “We know this is a very big series, especially since Long Beach is still number one. It’s very important to sweep because our goal for this entire year was a Big West Championship and we know sweeping puts us in a good position to be Big West Champions this year.”</p>\n<p>Of course, UCSB will have to go through Riverside first. The Gauchos are currently 30-18 overall and 10-5 in the Big West while the Highlanders travel south with a 22-26 overall and 3-12 conference mark. UCR has dropped five of its last six games while Santa Barbara has won nine of its last 11.</p>\n<p>“We just need to stay within striking distance until that last weekend (when UCSB plays LBSU),” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “[It’s] one game at a time because Riverside has taken some games from teams and that’s what’s exciting about the Big West. Nothing is a gimme at all.”</p>\n<p>After a series victory against a Hawaii team that UCSB has struggled with in the past, the Gauchos have plenty of momentum moving forward. The series featured three high-scoring games, two of which went into extra innings. In 34 innings against the Rainbow Wahine, Santa Barbara put 23 runs on the board.</p>\n<p>“We really proved that we can perform in pressure situations,” junior third baseman Jenessa Jeppesen said. “That’s going to make everyone push a little harder, work a little harder for this weekend and allow us to be more confident.”</p>\n<p>Freshman leftfielder Kristen Clark helped UCSB to victory in Sunday’s rubber game, hitting 4-4 at the plate. In doing so, she set the single season hitting record with 76 on the year. Clark currently ranks first in the Big West in hits with the second-best player over 10 hits lower at 65.</p>\n<p>“[Clark is] a great player,” Moore said. “In the lead-off position, she’s there to start rallies. Her speed allows us to stay in the game even when people think we’re out of the game. She’ll get that base hit and all you need is a base hit to start a rally, so she’s been a really important aspect to the team this year.”</p>\n<p>Riverside ranks in the lower half of nearly every statistical category both offensively and defensively. However, in their last nine games, the Highlanders are 3-0 when scoring six or more runs. All losses have come in lower-scoring games.</p>\n<p>Offensively, UCR’s biggest offensive threat is senior centerfielder Dionne Anderson. Anderson ranks fifth in the Big West in runs with 33, seventh in hits with 53, sixth in batting average at .379 and third in on-base percentage at .503.</p>\n<p>“Any team can come out and have a really great day and any great team can come out and have a bad day,” Jeppesen said. “It’s all about keeping our pitches where they need to be and having solid defense. We have to know how to pitch to them and play our defense. They’re all really strong runners, so we have to be on our toes on defense.”</p>\n<p>Trying to keep the score low and guarantee the Gauchos their fifth consecutive series victory is junior pitcher Shelby Wisdom.</p>\n<p>Currently 18-13 on the season, Wisdom has pitched the most innings in the Big West. Earning her 18th win last weekend, she passed her season win total from last season.</p>\n<p>Wisdom ranks seventh in the league in ERA at 3.38. Meanwhile, Riverside also has a solid pitcher in junior Alyssa Razo, who sits one spot above Wisdom with her 3.25 ERA.</p>\n<p>“Their pitching is not as fast as what we saw [last] weekend,” Jeppesen said. “We really have to be patient and work the count, but we have a lot of really disciplined hitters on the team. Hopefully, it’ll go in our favor.”</p>\n<p>First pitch in Saturday’s doubleheader is set for noon at Amy S. Harrison field. The series finale will take place Sunday at noon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of May 1st’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by</em>

That game in particular displayed the growth of the young Gauchos side, with the team keeping the game close throughout despite junior Coco Miller–the team’s leading scorer–shooting only 2-17 from the floor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara’s offense–the biggest culprit for the team’s slow start–has seen an uptick since sophomore guard Danae Miller came back from injury. Danae’s four assists per game leads the team, and her speed has allowed the Gauchos to play more in transition, leading to easier baskets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their last game against CSUN, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson opted to tighten up the rotation, playing both Danae Miller and Coco Miller for almost the entire game. While the Gauchos scored 73 points in that game, the bench contributed only 11 of those points–with all 11 coming from junior forward Tal Sahar. As conference play continues and fatigue becomes more of a factor, Henrickson will need greater production from her bench if the Gauchos hope to stay competitive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only one game into conference play, it’s risky to call any game a must-win matchup. Still, for two teams that have struggled mightily throughout the season, a win on Saturday will aid greatly in getting their season back on track. Given both teams’ offensive struggles and defensive prowess, expect a low-scoring affair on Saturday where 60 points may be all that’s needed to secure the win.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly (0-1, 3-9)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cal Poly women’s basketball team enters Saturday’s match just as desperate for a victory as any other Big West team after getting thumped at home by UC Irvine in their conference opener, 75-59.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the season, Cal Poly comes in with a 3-9 record, with only two of those victories over division I opponents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly to the Gauchos, the Achilles heel for Cal Poly all season has been their offense, with the team scoring only about 60 points per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, however, the Mustang’s offense has been slightly more potent since the return of graduate transfer Hana Vesela from injury.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her three games this season, Vesela has averaged almost 11 points per game. As she gets more acclimated to the team’s offense, her offensive output should continue to increase even more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday’s game will be a battle of two nearly identical teams when it comes to play style. Both teams look to play inside out, featuring their big on the inside to swallow up rebounds and finish off easy layups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the Mustangs, sophomore center Devin Stanback leads the team with 13.6 points per game while shooting an impressive 51 percent from the floor. For Santa Barbara, junior center Natalia Bruening has essentially played the same role, scoring 10 points per game while shooting 50 percent from the floor. Imperative to both team’s success on Saturday will be their stud center staying out of foul trouble–an issue that in particular has plagued Bruening throughout the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal Poly also excels on the boards; despite their overall struggles, they have consistently out-rebounded their opponents throughout the season. For a Gauchos team that prefers to play with four guards, it will be imperative for them to box-out and limit any easy second chance opportunities for the Mustangs.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State (0-0, 3-10)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite being picked to finish fourth in the Big West preseason poll, Long Beach State struggled significantly in non-conference play. With both an anemic offense and an undersized core that has been dominated on the glass, LBS limps into conference play with a 3-10 record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Led by sophomore guard Shanaijah Davison’s 14.8 points per game, Long Beach State averages fewer than 60 points per game. Even Davison — a preseason All-Big West pick — has struggled with her efficacy, shooting only 37 percent from the floor despite taking almost 15 shots per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Long Beach has been able to keep it close — with five of the team’s losses scoring in the single digits — the team has been sunk by its 59 free throw percentage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Long Beach has played with a relatively solid defense — they currently hold opponents to 43 percent from the floor — their Achilles heel all season has been their lack of rebounds. On average, Long Beach State has been outrebounded by 16 rebounds per game, allowing their opponents to have second-chance opportunities despite their solid initial defense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, they will enter conference play with a bit of momentum on their side after winning their last two non-conference matchups, including a 50-48 victory over Utah State in their last game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During that game, graduate transfer forward Cydnee Kinslow made her season debut after sitting out the first 12 games injured, and immediately made her presence known by grabbing nine rebounds in 37 minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The addition of Kinslow should help Long Beach play more competitively.    Though Long Beach State has struggled most of the season, don’t be surprised if Davison cleans up her offensive efficiency and leads the team to a .500 record in the conference.</span></p>\n<p><strong>UCI (1-0, 13-1)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Irvine women’s basketball team was selected to finish in third place by the Big West preseason poll with only sophomore forward Jordan Sanders earning a spot on the preseason All-Conference Team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, 13 games and one league match into the season, there is no doubt that the Anteaters are the team to beat thus far into conference play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, UCI is at the top of the Big West conference with a 1-0 league record and, more importantly, an 11-2 overall mark.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the Anteaters two losses came against a very tough Oregon team ranked No. 5 in the country but the other came against a much weaker San Diego State team that is just 5-8 on the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SDSU did beat two other Big West programs in Hawai’i and Cal State Fullerton but lost to UC Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, UC Irvine is the only team in the league thus far to have double digit wins and that is in large part to the performance of Sanders who is averaging an astonishing 21.1 points per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is not just the best mark on her team but the second best average in the Big West sitting just behind UC Davis’ Morgan Bertsch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanders also leads her team in rebounds per game with 5.5 boards per contest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also receives help from fellow teammates Lauren Saiki and Andee Ritter who both average double figures in points per contest.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With three stud players on offense, UC Irvine hopes it can continue its great start to the year and possibly earn a Big West title.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Irvine takes on CSUN on Saturday at 2 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><strong>CSUN (1-0, 7-8)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal State Northridge women’s basketball team is currently 7-8 on the year and will look to get back to .500 as they played their second game of the conference schedule.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has been an up and down year for the Matadors but they were able to pick up a win in their most recent matchup against UC Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are led by senior center Channon Fluker who is averaging a double double on the year with 16 points and 11 rebounds. She also leads the team with the highest field goal percentage from the field with 48.3 percent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the problems that the squad has faced this year is that they lack a consistent second scorer behind Fluker. With no one on the team averaging double figures besides Fluker, it has been difficult at times for them to put up points consistently. With them in the midst of conference play, it will be crucial for a second scorer to emerge in order to keep opposing defenses from keying on Fluker in the paint.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the flip side, CSUN has been very impressive on the defensive end of the floor as they have held opponents to just 38 percent from the field. Much of that can be attributed to the consistent ball pressure which has led to opposing offenses struggling to find the bottom of the net.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for the Matadors to turn their season around, they will need to find more ways to score the basketball, which also means that they must improve their three point percentage. With more consistent from behind the three point line, it will help keep defenses honest which will lead to easier shots for every player.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSUN is back in action at UC Irvine where they will look to pick up their second win in conference play at 2 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hawai’i (0-1, 4-10)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Big West play in full effect, the Hawai’i women’s basketball team is set to bounce back following a tough league opener loss to Cal State Fullerton.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, Hawai’i has struggled all year long boasting just a 4-10 overall mark to this point in the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the Rainbow Wahine are just 1-4 away from their home court.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, they will return home for a quick two-game stretch with matches against UC Davis and Cal State Northridge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just recently, Hawai’i had won three straight games with two coming against well known division I programs but it is now losers of three straight. It’s last two losses have been by a combined five points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming into conference play, the Rainbow Wahine were hoping to turn around this season and, despite a loss at the Cal State Fullerton, they still played a great game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Jan. 5, the Rainbow Wahine scored 68 points which was their third highest point total this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawai’i’s big scorer in that game was redshirt sophomore forward Amy Atwell who came up huge. She scored a career high 25 points in just 16 minutes with 18 of those points coming in the second half alone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the season, Atwell averages just four points a game, even after that terrific coming out party. With an increased role maybe she can be a factor this team needs to turn it around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, the Rainbow Wahine will hope to continue relying on junior forward Makenna Woodfolk who leads the team in points per game with the only player in double figures at 11.8.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, in the last three games she has averaged just three points per contest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawai’i will host UC Davis on Saturday at 1 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><strong>CSUF (1-0, 9-5)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cal State Fullerton women come into Big West play in 2019 one year removed from finishing last in the conference, missing out on the Big West Tournament and losing 12 out of their final 13 games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, however, their season is moving in a totally different trajectory, as they are currently sporting a 9-5 record and have won seven of their last eight contests —  including a win over Hawaii in their conference opener.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Titans have a roster that contains a mixture of upperclassmen and underclassmen that provide valuable contributions to the squad. Four players are scoring in double figures on the season and that group is lead by redshirt senior Daeja Smith, whose averages of 13.8 points per game and 9.7 rebounds per game rank fifth and second in the Big West, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to Smith, one of the keys to Fullerton’s early season success has been the playmaking ability of their backcourt duo.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raina Perez and Jade Vega both average double-digit scoring numbers to go along with their averages of five-plus assists per game, each.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perez and Vega rank second and third in the Big West in assists per game, giving Fullerton added versatility  as the two players are capable of handling the ball and playmaking for others on the floor. The ability that Perez and Vega have to score and assist the ball complements the inside scoring game of Daeja Smith and makes their team as a whole extremely difficult to guard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Titans finished in last place a season ago and were yet again picked to finish last according to the Big West preseason poll, but with the improved play of their returning players and the addition of some elite newcomers, Fullerton will look to turn the tables on the conference and show everyone that they can be a legitimate force in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside (0-1, 6-9)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conference play for women’s basketball is now in full effect, as the second fixture for UC Riverside’s Big West campaign is set for this Thursday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming off a close 59-67 defeat to UC Davis, for their first Big West confrontation, the UC Riverside Highlanders will look to improve as the young conference schedule begins to ramp up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far through the season, the Highlanders find themselves at a 6-9 overall record; enough for a .400 win percentage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signs point upwards, however, as the team evenly split their game schedule in the month of December, snagging a couple of road wins along the way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although, they’ll want to find their rhythm as soon as possible considering they dropped their first conference matchup of the new year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Riverside’s redshirt junior guard, Jannon Otto, leads all scorers on the team with 195 points to her name so far through the season; that’s a 13 point per game average. Playmaking seems to also run through her as she also leads her side in total assists with 47.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Close behind Otto, in scoring, is junior forward Marina Ewodo.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Featuring as the squad’s premier rim protector, Ewodo leads all her teammates in blocks, with 33, as well as rebounds, with a total of 107.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Together, these two tend to be at the top of opponents’ game plan as they play such a crucial part on the team this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of conference performance, UC Riverside finished as a middle of the table team in Big West standings last year; ending their campaign with a 6-10 overall record in conference play, good enough for the sixth seed in the playoffs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, they did perform very well during the postseason, making it as far as the semifinal stage; ultimately giving the No. 1 overall seed, UC Davis, a nail biter of a game after falling just short by a final score of 46-49.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as this young year goes, their 0-1 start places them in sixth place once again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expectations are high however, as a better league finish can set up yet another surprising playoff run for the Highlanders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up on UC Riverside’s schedule is another Big West bout, this time against Long Beach State, who is 3-10 on the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be Long Beach State’s first Big West matchup, but the Highlanders should have a slight upper hand entering this one.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Riverside hosts Long Beach State this Thursday, January 10th, in the SRC Arena at 7 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis (1-0, 9-5)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re the two-time defending regular season Big West champs. They’ve lost just four regular season Big West games in the last two years. They’ve got the fifth-leading scorer in the nation. They’ve won six games in a row.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Davis women’s basketball team is the team to beat in the Big West. That’s been the case for a couple of years, and a slow Aggie start isn’t enough to change that this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCD, now 9-5 and 1-0 in the Big West after beating UC Riverside, started this season 0-3. That mark included a blowout loss to then-no. 7 ranked Stanford and tough losses to Pacific and Portland State.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That start seems to be in the past now for head coach Jennifer Gross’s squad.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The eighth-year coach has guided her team and steadied the ship, even despite some key graduations from last year’s group.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the court, the turnaround has largely relied on the back of Morgan Bertsch, a 6’ 4” senior forward who’s fifth in the NCAA, is the leading scorer in UC Davis program history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Bertsch goes, so does the Aggie’s offense. That hasn’t been a problem considering the senior’s production, but it gives opponents an obvious point to focus on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Point guard Kourtney Eaton has been the woman in charge of feeding Bertsch, a job the four-year starter and the program’s all-time assist leader has performed capably with 5.1 assists per game. Junior forward Nina Bessolo works as Bertsch’s scoring complement with 9.3 points and 4.1 rebounds per game while sophomore Cierra Hall leads the team with 6.9 rebounds per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compared to the rest of the Big West, the Aggies love the three-ball. UCD has put up 333 threes so far this season, more than any other rival school. Only UCSB comes close with 331, and the Gauchos’ 26.1 percent mark from deep pales in comparison to UCD’s 32.4 percent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All that shooting and all those points – the Aggies are second in the Big West in points per game at 71.4 – hasn’t come at the expense of their defense. UCD has given up just 62.5 points per game, again second in the conference, and are holding opponents to a Big West-worst 36.5 points per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Davis is rolling on both ends of the court right now as they begin to defend their crown again.
