Ritter is currently posting a goals against average (GAA) of only 0.76 this season, compared to 0.87 last season, and has compiled a total of 27 saves. With a strong core of defenders to couple Ritter’s play, the UCSB women’s soccer team has notched five shutouts in only 10 games.</p>\n<p>“So far we have been really happy that we have been heading uphill on our journey to conference,” Ritter said. “We need to keep proving to ourselves that we can score goals.”</p>\n<p>With an impressive scoring outburst this past weekend, the Gauchos have improved their goals per game to 1.8 on the season. Junior midfielder/forward Angelisa Cortez has led this scoring attack with three goals and three assists over the past three games.</p>\n<p>It will certainly be a challenge for the Gauchos to keep up their blistering scoring pace however, as Duquesne enters this contest with a very stubborn defense of its own.</p>\n<p>Senior goalkeeper Devon Tabata has only allowed six goals this season and posts a GAA of 0.79. This is due in large part to an impressive 33 saves over only seven games. Just as the Gauchos, the defense for Duquesne has also produced five shutouts.</p>\n<p>On the other side, Duquesne’s offense has struggled this season as they have scored only nine goals and have a shot percentage of just .098. Sophomore midfielder Maddie Layman has been a bright spot though, as she leads the team with three goals and a shot percentage of .231.</p>\n<p>With all signs pointing to this being a highly defensive battle, the Gauchos do have one key advantage working in their favor. The UCSB women’s soccer team will have had an entire seven days to prepare for this match, compared to only two for Duquesne.</p>\n<p>“I think [the rest] is definitely an advantage,” Ritter said. “We can get in a few more sessions and focus on the recovery and maintenance of our bodies.”</p>\n<p>The match will kick off this Sunday at Harder Stadium at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p>A version of this article

When the Gauchos have played away from home, opposing teams have flustered them with gameplans centered around sending hopeful long balls into the box, substituting constantly and fouling to keep them from trapping and passing the way they want to.</p>\n<p>“Our record on the road is not good enough. We need to learn how to win ugly and not just win pretty like we do at home,” Murphy said. “As a team we need to figure it out and we need to figure it out quick.”</p>\n<p>The most impactful issue for UCSB, though, has been the utter decimation of its defense.</p>\n<p>Key defensive starters in Murphy and senior right back Kevin-Garcia Lopez have been hampered by injuries, with Garcia-Lopez slated to miss the next two weeks. Sophomore captain Paul Ehmann has officially left the team to return to Germany, leaving a gaping hole for the Gauchos to fill in their back line. Additionally, freshman Jeff Quezada and junior Dylan Murphy missed over a full game each after being red carded two games ago.</p>\n<p>“It’s been kind of crazy the last couple weeks with Paul leaving and suspensions and injuries, but at the end of the day it’s not acceptable to be bleeding goals like we have been,” Murphy said. “It’s on us to step up and take ownership. It’s not a problem that’s solved overnight but we’ve got to figure it out quick.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ current streak of three straight without a win has been accompanied by their worst offensive slump this year, with the team having scored just one goal during that stretch. Ending that slump could be difficult this weekend against the Big West’s number one defense in Davis, which gives up just 0.60 goals per game to opposing teams. To make matters worse, leading goal scorer sophomore forward Nick DePuy will miss the game due to yellow card accumulation after being booked for the fifth time this season against LMU on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>“We have to defend better. We have to find somebody on the field that can find us a goal,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “It’s the same thing that we did when we won four games in a row. Again, right now, it’s all about our defense.”</p>\n<p>Luckily for UCSB, Davis has struggled recently, mirroring the Gauchos with just one goal in its last three outings. Junior midfielder Lucas Mohageg leads the way with three goals, but the Aggies have not been particularly dangerous on offense all season, averaging just one goal per game as a team.</p>\n<p>“Davis is a tough place to play and it’s not a very pretty game. We’ve just got to instill some self-belief again and go along those lines,” Murphy said. “It’s not about the opponent, it’s all within ourselves at the moment.”</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos can find a way to win against Davis, it would be their first Big West road win since they defeated the same Aggies last October in a thrilling 3-2 double overtime victory. However, according to Vom Steeg, they will need to stay strong mentally in order to overcome the recent setbacks that have plagued them.</p>\n<p>“To win on the road you have to have the right mentality,” Vom Steeg said. “Do I feel like we still have a more talented team than, say, UC Davis? Sure. But you’ve got to have the right mentality to win a game like that.”</p>\n<p>The game is set to kickoff at 3:00 p.m. this Saturday at Aggie Soccer Field.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56931\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-16/at-a-mid-season-crossroad/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56931\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-16/at-a-mid-season-crossroad/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-16/at-a-mid-season-crossroad/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-16/at-a-mid-season-crossroad/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-16/at-a-mid-season-crossroad/","id":1546,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1545,1544,1543],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to End Preseason With Momentum","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/UCSB-Mens-Soccer-9.27.2013-Peter-Vandenbelt-13.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/UCSB-Mens-Soccer-9.27.2013-Peter-Vandenbelt-13.jpeg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB tries to rebound from loss to No. 1 UCLA with two home games this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coming off of a tough 1-0 loss to No. 1 UCLA last Saturday, the UCSB men’s soccer team is looking to get back on track with home games against San Diego State and Drake University this weekend.</p>\n<p>The loss to the Bruins dropped the Gauchos below .500 for the second time this season to a record of 2-3-1.

Despite the Aztecs’ hot start to the season, home-field advantage may prove to be an important factor as all five of their wins this year have come at home.</p>\n<p>“San Diego State is kind of a scrappy team. They won’t really make 10, 15 passes in a row,” sophomore goalkeeper Josh McNeely said. “I think they’re just going to try to sit behind the ball and capitalize on one of our mistakes, but that’s where we have to do better and keep it tight in the back.”</p>\n<p>San Diego’s offense is powered by forward David Olsen, who has scored a team-high five goals in seven starts. The 6’0” freshman is complemented on the attacking front by sophomore forward Forrayah Bass, who has accumulated three goals and four assists in only five starts this season.</p>\n<p>“[The Aztecs] have some good players up front that’ve been scoring a lot of goals,” Vom Steeg said. “I think it’s a dangerous attacking team, but they’ve also been giving up goals.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos did just hold the No. 1 team in the nation to a single goal last weekend, they have had some early season defensive struggles, most notably in giving up three goals to No. 22 Furman and four to No. 19 Stanford in previous weeks.</p>\n<p>“This is one of those games where I think it’s a good opportunity for us to take advantage of a defense that maybe isn’t as good as UCLA’s, but obviously we haven’t gotten a shutout this year,” Vom Steeg said. “We have a lot to do defensively to make sure that we start getting shutouts.”</p>\n<p>On Sunday, Drake will come to town looking to build on its recent 1-0 win over UMKC. The Bulldogs, who are currently averaging just over one goal per game as a team, have had their own share of defensive struggles this season, giving up 11 scores in just seven games.</p>\n<p>“The thing about Drake is that they’re a very disciplined team. They play basically a 4-5-1, they’re very organized,” Vom Steeg sad. “It’s a team that in the past we’ve struggled to find goals against, so hopefully we can find some goals on Friday night and have that lead into Sunday.”</p>\n<p>A point of emphasis for UCSB this weekend will be its offensive presence, especially after a solid defensive outing against UCLA was essentially wasted due to its inability to score a goal. So far, the team total of eight goals has been equally spread between eight different players.</p>\n<p>“Offensively, it’s not just scoring goals, we need to be more dangerous,” Vom Steeg said. “We need to be able to get more coming off the amount of times we’re on the ball.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos know they won’t necessarily be able to control how many goals they score or concede, what they must control is their mental game. Mental lapses on the defense have been costly at times this season, and the importance of every moment on the field will only grow when Big West play begins next week.</p>\n<p>“We have these little 10-minute lapses where we either lose focus or are under a bit of pressure, which is normal for soccer games. We just have to really stay focused for those 10 minutes,” McNeely said. “[The key] is just going to be staying focused for a full 90 minutes, improving on our defensive errors, and really staying focused in those ten-minute lapses.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff against San Diego State is set for 7:00 p.m. this Friday, while the game against Drake is scheduled for 6:00 p.m. on Sunday.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of September 25, 2014th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56204\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/gauchos-look-to-end-preseason-with-momentum/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56204\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/gauchos-look-to-end-preseason-with-momentum/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/gauchos-look-to-end-preseason-with-momentum/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/gauchos-look-to-end-preseason-with-momentum/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/gauchos-look-to-end-preseason-with-momentum/","id":1547,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1546,1545,1544],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Capture Momentum With Pair of Wins","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/jomegonz.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/jomegonz.jpg?resize=980%2C625&ssl=1","description":"UCSB takes down Drake University and San Diego State to improve its record to 4-3-1.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In its final two games before the beginning of Big West play, the UCSB men’s soccer team went undefeated this weekend with a 4-1 win over Drake University and a 1-0 victory over San Diego State.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos improve to 4-3-1 on the season with their latest win over Drake on Sunday.

The freshman was able to keep the shot low as he placed it into the right side of the net, giving the Gauchos’ their fastest scored goal this season.</p>\n<p>“We talked about being dangerous, and I thought we were dangerous right from the get-go,” Vom Steeg said. “Our gameplan was to get on the board early and get good wide play from [Lopez] on the right and [sophomore midfielder Ismaila Jome] on the left. Sometimes you draw things up and it actually works and I tonight we got the ball in the right spots early and that first goal was really important.”</p>\n<p>UCSB kept the early pressure on and was able to capitalize off poor defending in the 21st minute. Left back Drew Murphy joined the attack before playing a 1-2 to Ahl and finding space at the edge of the box. The sophomore was then able to waltz through the defense against a weak challenge before scoring an easy tap-in goal past the keeper.</p>\n<p>“It’ll never happen again, it’s like they wanted everything but the ball,” Murphy joked. “It made me look good, a lot better than it was. I wouldn’t expect something like that again.”</p>\n<p>In the 28th minute, Murphy returned the favor, finding Ahl at the near post off a corner kick. Ahl finished it with a high, first-touch shot into the top left corner of the net, giving him a brace on the day.</p>\n<p>“[Ludwig] had the same look on Friday night and he put it over the bar, so I thought he took real good care of that thing to keep it down and tucked it in,” Vom Steeg said. “We got the ball in the right places, we put it in the right spot and I thought it was a great finish.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos ended up tacking on one more when in the 82nd minute, senior forward Reed McKenna got past his defender with a nice move on the right side of the box. He then set himself up for a shot on his favored left foot and fired it into the right corner of the net.</p>\n<p>What should have been a second straight shutout for UCSB and freshman goalkeeper Brandon Berke could not be preserved, however, as in the 85th minute, a Drake player earned a penalty after being knocked down in the box. Junior defender Alec Bartlett stepped up to put away his first goal of the season, placing his shot into the right side of the net while Berke dove the other way.</p>\n<p>In Friday’s game against San Diego State, the Gauchos shook up their lineup looking to bounce back from being shutout at home against No. 1 UCLA last week. Berke got the first start of his career at goalkeeper, filling in for injured sophomore goalkeeper Josh McNeely, and sophomore midfielder/defender Nick DePuy got the start at forward.</p>\n<p>The switch paid off, as DePuy got his team on the board in the 21st minute. A low-cross from Murphy took Aztec freshman goalkeeper Adam Allmaras off his line to slap the ball away, accidentally sending it right to DePuy, who easily put away his second goal of the season.</p>\n<p>Despite giving up three shots on goal and twelve in total, UCSB was able to earn its first shutout of the year behind Berke and his three saves. The Gauchos also had one of their most productive weekends offensively, getting off 33 shots through two games with 15 on frame.</p>\n<p>UCSB will return to action this Thursday at 7:00 p.m. when it opens up its conference schedule against Cal State Northridge.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56274\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-29/gauchos-capture-momentum-with-pair-of-wins/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56274\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-29/gauchos-capture-momentum-with-pair-of-wins/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-29/gauchos-capture-momentum-with-pair-of-wins/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-29/gauchos-capture-momentum-with-pair-of-wins/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-29/gauchos-capture-momentum-with-pair-of-wins/","id":1548,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1547,1546,1545],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
