Additionally, Padilla will be able to create tools that make it easier for researchers to organize information that is already available to them, such as email correspondence and documents in inaccessible formats.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">New Mac computers also made their debut in the Learning Commons earlier this summer, which are now the only Mac computers available on campus for general student use.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The installation of the six iMacs and three MacPros comes as part of the technology plan that came with the expansion of Davidson Library.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“We feel that the Mac operating system is the best fit to accommodate for increasingly interdisciplinary coursework,” Rebecca Metzger, the library outreach coordinator, said. “It’s not unusual for a biology student to need a film editing program for a final class project, for instance.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Metzger, funding for the computers came from the library’s budget, mostly made up of state money and private donations. The library also plans to use $30,000 to $40,000 from the Class of 2016 senior class gift to install additional technology.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">One of the biggest plans for the upcoming school year is to address the compact space issue inside the library. Over 250,000 people visit the library every month, and this is expected to increase with one of the largest incoming freshman classes in history starting UCSB in fall 2016.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">This year, library staff will focus on adding furniture and expanding late-night study to other parts of the building. The second floor Mountainside will become available Fall Quarter for late-night hours.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Metzger said she is currently working with UCSB’s Health &amp; Wellness Center to obtain two egg chairs for the library that will help promote relaxation during the demanding academic year.</p>\n<p>According to Metzger, improving the learning commons is an evolving process, and the library staff is always looking for student suggestions regarding technology needs and furniture needs. Suggestions can be submitted at the wooden boxes on the services desks or by emailing <i>outreach@library.ucsb.edu</i>.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, September 22, 2016, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72571\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/library-funding-aims-at-tech-advances/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72571\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/library-funding-aims-at-tech-advances/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/library-funding-aims-at-tech-advances/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/library-funding-aims-at-tech-advances/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/library-funding-aims-at-tech-advances/","id":2709,"author":{"id":153,"name":"Gerardo Banuelos"},"related":[2708,2707,2706],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":153,"name":"Gerardo Banuelos","biography":"Not available","articles":[2709,4492],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Finance and Business Committee for an upcoming event featuring Ben Shapiro, a political commentator who will present a criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>\n<p>Shapiro, former editor of conservative news source Breitbart, last <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-13/fox-contributor-speaks-on-guns-media-at-ucsb/\" target=\"_blank\">spoke at UCSB</a> in 2013. He has previously been banned from speaking engagements at other universities and was escorted off the CSU Los Angeles campus in May 2016 due to protests.</p>\n<p>During the College Republicans’ lengthy presentation, speakers swore more than once and had to field multiple questions from the finance and business committee, including doubts about safety.</p>\n<p>“Our purpose is not to be offensive for the sake of being offensive; that’s childish, and no one wants that,” Andrew Gates, president of College Republicans, told the <em>Nexus</em>. “We believe that offering a different perspective would open a civil dialogue.”</p>\n<p>The group asked for $350 to reserve Corwin Pavilion, $650 for security and $4,000 for Shapiro’s speaker fee.</p>\n<p>The hefty security budget of $650 highlights an underlying risk of violence. Gates has organized similar events in the past and reassured the committee there would be no tolerance for any form of violence.</p>\n<p>“We won’t assault anyone,” he said at the meeting.</p>\n<p>Two attendees in support of College Republicans were seated at the front of the room wearing “Make America Great Again” hats, drawing looks of disapproval from other audience members.</p>\n<p>Shapiro has been vocal in his criticism in the Black Lives Matter movement, saying that it lacks values and acts as a source of violence.</p>\n<p>“Obviously, Ben Shapiro has a message, and we agree with that message,” Gates said, “Anyone who thinks he’s irrational or immoral or the worst person ever is free to [say] so at the Q&amp;A portion of the event.”</p>\n<p>“I understand the purpose of the Black Lives Matter movement; I understand the reasoning behind the name,” Gates said, but added that he takes issue with how statistics are applied to support assertions of inequality in black communities.</p>\n<p>Gates also said it’s unfair to suggest that white people cannot be subject to racism.</p>\n<p>“It’s sort of a clever way of in academia to get away with saying shitty things about white people,” he said.</p>\n<p>After heated discussion between committee members, finance and business committee chairman Reilly Hobson interjected, reminding everyone that ideology does not influence whether a group should receive funding.</p>\n<p>After an initial objection, followed by a vote with seven members voting to approve funding and four members abstaining, College Republicans were granted the funds.</p>\n<p>They are pursuing additional funding from Young Americans for Liberty as well as other conservative political organizations in the Santa Barbara area.</p>\n<p>The funding is pending approval by the A.S. Senate during Wednesday’s meeting at 6:30 p.m. in the Flying A Room of the UCen.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73657\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/a-s-to-fund-college-republicans-event-featuring-ben-shapiro/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73657\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/a-s-to-fund-college-republicans-event-featuring-ben-shapiro/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/a-s-to-fund-college-republicans-event-featuring-ben-shapiro/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/a-s-to-fund-college-republicans-event-featuring-ben-shapiro/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/a-s-to-fund-college-republicans-event-featuring-ben-shapiro/","id":2707,"author":{"id":109,"name":"Brandon Chen"},"related":[2706,2705,2704],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bird Calls Persist While Residents Call for Reprieve","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-11-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sanic-gallery9.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sanic-gallery9.jpg?resize=900%2C596&ssl=1","description":"Residents of the neighboring San Miguel and San Nicolas dorms have received reports from resident assistants about students yelling “cacaw” at all hours of the day and night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_73662\" style=\"width: 765px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sanmig-slider2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1468668014\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73659\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73662\" data-attachment-id=\"73662\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/bird-calls-persist-while-residents-call-for-reprieve/sanmig-slider2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sanmig-slider2.jpg?fit=755%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"755,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"sanmig-slider2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sanmig-slider2.jpg?fit=250%2C99&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sanmig-slider2.jpg?fit=755%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73662\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sanmig-slider2.jpg?resize=755%2C300\" alt=\"The bird calls originated between San Miguel and San Nicholas Residence Halls.

While around five students from his floor were stopped, the resident assistant speculates there must be at least 15 rooms involved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a majority of the yelling taking place as late as midnight, the perpetrators have drawn the ire of many students with early classes or jobs, prompting screaming matches between those yelling “cacaw” and those trying to get sleep. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students in the dorms have yelled back pleas for quietude, various profanities and some resorted to threatening violence against the bird callers. Some students remain unbothered.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carmiya Baskin, a first-year residing in San Miguel, said, “there are always people on the lawn talking,” and the bird calls have not really disturbed her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tiffany Wu, an RA in San Miguel, sent a text message to residents stating there had been “a lot of noise complaints lately. A lot of it is coming from outside the building … the RAs are currently working on investigating this issue.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While she doesn’t know the total amount of noise complaints, she has received over 10 noise complaints from her floors alone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residence hall staff has identified and spoken to several students from San Nicolas, though no student was individually documented. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the bird calls have decreased in volume and frequency, they are still taking place.

Half of the dormitories and a new dining hall should be completed by the end of fall 2016.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Parking spots next to Santa Catalina have been out of commission since last year and have been relocated one mile up to campus at Lot 38.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">At the end of construction, San Joaquin North and Tower Villages will house 1,000 student beds in three-bedroom, double occupancy apartments. A new two-story Portola Dining Commons will have outdoor and indoor seating.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Road construction surrounding the new housing has raised concerns from many Isla Vistans who say the new crossing system will pose risks to children who attend the adjacent Isla Vista Elementary School. University architects and planners believe the crosswalk plan will enhance safety and create easy access between the two sides of El Colegio and Storke Road.</p>\n<h3 align=\"JUSTIFY\">Visiting Scholars’ Residence for the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP)</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_72581\" style=\"width: 3010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"374399950\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72566\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72581\" data-attachment-id=\"72581\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/campus-construction-chugs-along/kitp-visiting-scholars-residence-isla-vista-aug-19th-2016-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg?fit=3000%2C1622&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,1622\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"KITP Visiting Scholar’s Residence, Isla Vista, Aug 19th 2016.\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg?fit=250%2C135&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg?fit=888%2C480&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72581\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg?resize=888%2C480\" alt=\"Hari Patel / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg?resize=250%2C135&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg?resize=768%2C415&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C554&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72581\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Hari Patel / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Spanning 75,000-square-feet, the large visiting scholars’ residence next to the San Clemente apartments is slated to open the first week of January 2017.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The development was announced in October 2015 as an addition to UCSB’s storied KITP. The main location of the research program is the orange porthole building next to the Channel Islands Five (Chi-5) Residence Halls.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The residence on El Colegio Road will include meeting rooms, shared kitchens, dining rooms, a gym and 61 apartment-style, fully-furnished private bedrooms with private bathrooms.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">All developments have gone as planned, according to KITP residence manager James Brill, and the building will soon allow for “unhampered creative exchange” between all visiting scientists.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Charles Munger, business partner of Warren Buffett, made the construction possible by donating $65 million to KITP. More recently, he committed $200 million to UCSB to replace the Chi-5 dorms with more modern amenities. The plan is still running through several stages of approval.</p>\n<h3 align=\"JUSTIFY\">Faculty Club Construction</h3>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The faculty club is a reiteration of an earlier faculty residence and conference area, first designed by Charles W. Moore in 1966.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The club, intended to host visitors, will have 34 boutique hotel-style rooms, an enclosed pavilion for meetings, presentations and private parties, two social and event terraces, meeting rooms, a members’ lounge, a bar, a main dining area and a manager’s suite.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Construction will wrap up in early October, according to campus architect Ed Schmittgen. “However, there is a period of time that UCSB needs to work in the building prior to opening to the public,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">They will address items such as orienting staff, training and familiarization with building systems during this period.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72568\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72568\" data-attachment-id=\"72568\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/campus-construction-chugs-along/faculty-club-by-christina-demarzo-print-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Faculty-Club-by-Christina-DeMarzo-PRINT-1.jpg?fit=3000%2C1987&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,1987\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"faculty-club-by-christina-demarzo-print-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Faculty-Club-by-Christina-DeMarzo-PRINT-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Faculty-Club-by-Christina-DeMarzo-PRINT-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-72568\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Faculty-Club-by-Christina-DeMarzo-PRINT-1-1024x678.jpg?resize=888%2C588\" alt=\"faculty club construction.
