Levine, claims that the officers, due to the accusations of “misconduct, dishonesty, and improper investigative techniques,” “intentionally violated” Galoustian’s right to due process and a fair trial, according to a motion filed with the court on Oct. 3. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levine attached copies of a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-07/former-officer-sues-ucpd-alleges-racism-misconduct-and-conspiracy-throughout-department/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lawsuit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> filed by former UCPD Officer Ryan Smith, referred to as John Doe in court documents, as well as articles by the </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2019/05/09/whistleblower-lawsuits-blow-lid-off-ucsb-police/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara Independent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the Daily Nexus describing the lawsuit, as supporting documents for the motion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The motion names Officers Ryan Hashimoto, Michael Little and Tiffany Little as well as Lieutenant Mark Signa and argues that “the defense needs the requested information to properly prepare for trial on this matter.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specifically, the defense argues that because Hashimoto allegedly circulated a video “of an alleged sexual assault that was evidence in [Galoustian’s] case,” the video tapes have been “tampered with and no longer reflect the original content.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the motion, Levine also referenced an allegation in the UCPD lawsuits that said “many reports were being taken by UCSBPD officers, sanctioned by Signa, where males were being listed as rape and sexual assault suspects, despite no evidence of a crime occurring.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Traits of dishonesty, misconduct, false sexual assault reports, and improper investigative techniques are very relevant issues in this matter, as is whether or not Hashimoto and the other officers and employees of UCSBPD tampered with video or audio evidence in this and in other cases,” Levine wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The motion requests: </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The name, address and telephone number of all persons who accuses any above-named officer of acts constituting misconduct.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The name, address and telephone number of all persons who were interviewed as potential witnesses to any of the aforementioned accusations of misconduct.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The name, address and telephone number of all persons who accuses any above named officer of making false, misleading or inaccurate statements (or committing any other misconduct, such as threatening or coercing or interfering with witnesses), orally, in writing or in any other form, during an official, internal affairs or any other investigation conducted by the Investigating Department or any other agency.

\r\n</script> \n<p>While baseball was invented in the United States, it is a game that has evolved below the equator in many Latin American countries.</p>\n<p>When the U.S. military began to occupy Latin America in the early 1900s, soldiers brought along the game of baseball and the native peoples took it and transformed it.<br>\nGone were the rigid unwritten rules that chastised emotional outbursts and encouraged robotic behavior.</p>\n<p>Latinos played baseball the way they played soccer: with their hearts on their sleeves and exuberance in every at-bat.</p>\n<p>This energy has translated into great success for Latinos in the MLB who, with pioneers like Orlando Cepeda and contemporary phenoms like the late Jose Fernandez, have more than caught up skill- and talent-wise with the “originators” of baseball.</p>\n<p>When Bud Norris says, “We’re opening the game,” he puts himself, and subsequently white men as the gatekeepers of who is allowed to play, essentially disregarding the notion of a meritocracy that is crucial to all sports.</p>\n<p>To behave as though one group has the right to include or exclude people from the game of baseball is to ignore the history of how the game has proliferated to other countries, and it creates a false narrative that devalues the contributions of Latinos to the game.</p>\n<p>The other problematic aspect of this quote is the feeling that Latinos are bringing a sense of disrespect to the game.</p>\n<p>Even though Latinos make up about 26 percent of the league, almost 50 percent of the brawls this year have pitted whites against Latinos.</p>\n<p>Whether it is a Yasiel Puig bat-flip or a Jose Bautista home run trot around the bases that is deemed a little too long, there is something that pisses pitchers (a predominantly white position) off about the way that Latinos play the game.</p>\n<p>However, it isn’t merely the Latino style of play that is aggravating to players; it is the fact that they seemingly don’t respect “American” culture.</p>\n<p>This is exemplified in the recent story of a minor league training room in which a white player killed the radio that some Latinos were listening to some Spanish music on and declared,</p>\n<p>“Hey, Reggaeton, es no bueno. America! English music!”</p>\n<p>This notion that it is somehow disrespectful to America and baseball to express your Latin identity is problematic in that it establishes a hierarchy of cultures in the MLB that allows some players to feel entitled to denounce others not based on their play but on their culture.</p>\n<p>I do not want to give off the impression that this attitude is present in all MLB players. For instance, former catcher Dave Valle learned Spanish while playing winter ball in Latin America for five seasons.</p>\n<p>He said, “The benefits were me having a world view of what my teammates came from.”</p>\n<p>It gave me a better understanding of the Latin culture, and as a teammate, it helped me as a leader to be that bridge between the American guys and Latino guys because I could speak a little bit of Spanish and help them.”</p>\n<p>This drive to create empathy and companionship among different cultures is what is necessary to have a more equal and unified MLB, and only once this is attained can baseball truly be America’s pastime.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the March 9, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

During the talk, the pair discussed the legacy of the movement and what has changed after two years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two began by talking about their daughters. “When our investigation began, my daughter weighed 12 pounds” and “had never eaten a plate of solid food,” Twohey said. Kantor’s youngest daughter “liked grabbing phones so much that by the end of the summer, she had accidentally managed to FaceTime Ashley Judd.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good laugh from the audience later, Kantor then posed the question: “So when these girls are much older, what are we going to tell them about Harvey Weinstein?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weinstein was not the first to be accused of sexual misconduct. In particular, Kantor noted, the New York Times had published an article in April 2017 revealing how then-television host Bill O’Reilly paid out millions of dollars to women with numerous claims against him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With that in mind, the editors gathered a bunch of reporters — including me — and asked what now seems like a quaint question: ‘Are there </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">other</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> powerful men who have covered up inappropriate treatment of women?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a trail of whispers, Kantor explained that she eventually managed to hold off-the-record conversations with Rose McGowan, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ashley Judd, all of who “separately told me very harrowing stories about Harvey Weinstein and hotel rooms.” But for the most part, people were generally reluctant to share their experiences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pair knew they needed to take a different approach than getting people on the record in order to implicate Weinstein. It was difficult enough to convince people to talk officially in the first place, but Kantor explained that they also needed concrete evidence in the form of settlements, human resource records and the testimonies of ex-Weinstein employees to avoid a “‘he said, she said’ kind of story.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two dug around and Twohey finally found the people who had been waiting 25 years for her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their cases, Kantor and Twohey could not print what they learned, but that’s not to say they didn’t learn anything. The first woman was legally prohibited from saying anything; the second woman’s husband denied any possibility of sexual assault due to a genuine lack of knowledge of what had happened to his wife.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two said that by now, they had learned about the extreme restrictiveness of secret settlements. No matter how willing the victim is to speak, their silence was mandated by agreements signed years ago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One call Twohey and Kantor made was to Irwin Reiter, Weinstein’s “gruff, loyal” accountant of 30 years. They did not expect him to help, but he ended up becoming a pivotal figure in the investigation, having become disillusioned with his boss after Weinstein’s obsession with sex became increasingly alarming. Reiter began sneaking Kantor details associated with Weinstein for the team to check out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One night in September 2017, Reiter gave Kantor a memo to copy by employee Lauren O’Connor, who wrote statements along the lines of, “At this company, the balance of power is Harvey Weinstein: 10, me: 0.” The accusations in the memo, which described Weinstein’s acts in around 2014 and 2015, helped the investigation take on a new urgency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, there were those seeking to undermine Twohey and Kantor’s progress.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Twohey, prominent attorney David Boies worked with Weinstein to silence his victims and, now, the New York Times piece by way of a $300,000-contract to former Israeli intelligence officials from private intelligence company Black Cube. Their objective was to “target” the sources and journalists behind the story and stop it from ever going to print. As Twohey put it, “It was basically a ‘hit’ on our project.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the final 48 hours before Kantor and Twoheypublished the story, the two presented Weinstein their findings and gave him a chance to tell his side of the story. As publication neared, Weinstein took on a more direct, confrontational role. Flanked by a small cadre of prominent attorneys and prosecutors, Twohey said he “barged” into the Times’ office with folders of photos showing women, some of them involved in allegations against him, smiling and acting happy next to him, along with information that was meant to discredit and embarrass them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They were threatening lawsuits against us. They were basically bullying us and trying to attack us as individuals.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In spite of all of the work and risk put into the story, Kantor and Twohey still had doubts about whether anyone would care when the story was published. To the audience in Campbell Hall, Kantor asked, “Who here had never heard of Harvey Weinstein before this story?” Surveying the hands, she concluded, “A substantial number of people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They were additionally concerned that not enough people would go on the record. Laura Madden, the only person who had agreed by that point to do so, nearly changed her mind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twohey and Kantor learned their fears were unjustified, however, when Madden sent the pair a note that read, “I realize that time is short. I want my daughters to grow up in a different world. I am happy to go on the record.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashley Judd, meanwhile, came forward at the last minute as well, stating that “women have been talking about Harvey Weinstein for a long time privately, and it’s past time to start having the conversation publically.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then the article was published.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turmoil ensued within the Weinstein Company and board members were split on what to do. Weinstein himself refused to go down quietly, Twohey and Kantor explained. “There are going to be women’s organizations that have my back,” he said, defending himself. “There are going to be dozens of them, and there’s gonna be a movement.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And … and there was!” Twohey responded with amusement along with the audience. “But not the kind he was predicting.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Largely inspired by the revelations brought forward in the article, the #MeToo hashtag began trending on social media, used by both celebrity and non-famous individuals to share their own stories of sexual harassment and assault. But, two years later, what’s next?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kantor, there is a “mounting sense of unfairness about the issue on both sides”: Supporters and victims believe society hasn’t gone far enough in addressing sexism and power, and detractors, especially those accused of wrongdoing, believe society has gone too far without a “clear and sound process in place for evaluating these kinds of complaints.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Citing increasing divisions within the movement, Twohey asks people to consider and reconsider the weight of sexual misconduct allegations, the vetting process and the extent to which those accused should be held accountable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kantor ends with her own questions on the legacy of #MeToo. Will her kids still see sexual harassment and assault as everyday occurrences? “Or, will we be able to say, ‘I was there when things changed?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We don’t have all the answers to these questions,” Twohey contends; a journalist’s goal, she said, is to get the full story and have the reader draw their own conclusions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But one thing Kantor wants to make clear is this: “You can’t solve a problem you can’t see.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

text. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Efforts to increase the Pell Grant award have been introduced in Congress before; Congressman Carbajal introduced the </span><a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr2260\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Middle Class </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating Higher Education Affordability Necessary to Compete Economically (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.H.A.N.C.E.) Act</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on May 1, 2017, which would have increased the maximum award for Pell Grants, but the bill did not make it past that session of Congress. The </span><a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s3018\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Degrees Not Debt Act of 2018</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, introduced by Senator Martin Heinrich on June 6, 2018, also fell short in that session. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carbajal, a UC Santa Barbara alumnus,</span><a href=\"https://carbajal.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=15121\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> relied on Pell Grants</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to help pay for his college degree and “understands firsthand the difficulty students face when contemplating how to afford a higher education,” according to his personal website. The new $10,000 amount is meant to reflect the average cost of in-state tuition at public, four-year institutions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t wait any longer to act on student debt, and the Degrees Not Debt Act is a solid way to make financial aid and college more accessible to more people. The cost to attend UCSB as an in-state student is more than $12,000, but the Pell Grant currently caps off at $6,195,” Carbajal wrote in a statement to the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have to do more for our students, and I’m glad to have worked with student advocates across the state over the past year to make this idea a reality.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The re-introduction of a bill to increase the maximum amount of the Federal Pell Grant award comes during a time when conversations about both tuition and student debt are subjects of heavy debate on the national stage. This past summer, Democratic presidential candidates </span><a href=\"https://elizabethwarren.com/debt/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elizabeth Warren</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/issues/free-college-cancel-debt/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bernie Sanders</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> both introduced plans to cancel student debt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 72% of UCSB students received some form of financial aid through the university during the 2018-19 school year, according to UCSB’s </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/campus.profiles/campus.profiles.2018.19.pdf\">campus profile.</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s a really big increase,” External Vice President for Statewide Affairs Daevionne Beasley said. “That is a lot of money, especially to a low-income student, these thousands of dollars matter.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The aid is only a bandaid to the larger institutional problem of charging people astronomical amounts of money for a good education,” he added. “I will always be an advocate for free college and free tuition… but until we can get to that point, the more financial aid, the better.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the EVPSA office’s legislative agenda has not been finalized yet, Beasley said that the EVPSA office will be advocating for the Degrees Not Debt Act on future lobbying trips. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Oct. 17, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Updated [Oct. 19, 2:16 p.m.]</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.
