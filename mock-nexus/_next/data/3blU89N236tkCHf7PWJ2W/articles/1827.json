The workshops were also recorded so professors could access them later on the </span><a href=\"https://keepteaching.id.ucsb.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instructional Continuity site.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Adler-Kassner, UCSB’s history of teaching through natural disasters and crises turned out to be helpful in responding to the coronavirus pandemic.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had a pretty good infrastructure to support this partly because of the Thomas Fire,” Adler-Kassner said. “We already had the Instructional Continuity site set up, and because we know Summer Sessions A and B and all the sessions in between will be offered remotely, we’re developing more resources.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Instructional Support Team also holds regular online “coffee hours” over Zoom for instructors and teaching assistants to talk about their remote instruction experiences. If a staff member needs assistance outside of these meetings, the support team is readily available for consultation, Adler-Kassner said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we think toward fall and wait for the campus to provide some guidance about what’s going to happen, we’ll of course be there to support that in very proactive ways,” Adler-Kassner added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from teaching support, the UCSB Academic &amp; Staff Assistance Program (ASAP) is  providing mental and emotional health support for faculty. The group, which offers short-term counseling, consultations, workshops and more, is assisting professors in identifying and managing work-related and personal concerns; these resources are available on </span><a href=\"https://www.hr.ucsb.edu/asap\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the ASAP website.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ASAP also organized the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 Pandemic Coping Skills Resource Group, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which holds group meetings for staff to connect with each other, discuss and learn coping skills and maintain their psychological well-being under stressful circumstances, as described in an email sent out to faculty by the Pati Montojo, the ASAP manager and a licensed psychologist. The group has also started a </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGmApjVWytiKQksNDjoZw8g/featured\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YouTube channel</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, uploading videos that help viewers understand anxieties related to the pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall, who supervises academic planning and programming at UCSB, described the shift to remote learning as a “miraculous transformation,” praising the faculty and staff for their dedication to making the online environment possible in just a few weeks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If somebody had asked us a year ago and said, ‘We want you to transform your whole curriculum to remote teaching, and we’re going to give you a year to do it,’ people would’ve said, ‘Are you crazy?’” Marshall said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Marshall, while instruction for Fall Quarter 2020 remains uncertain, the university hopes to welcome students back to campus for future quarters. However, campus life will likely </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-10/hybrid-course-schedules-single-dorms-face-masks-for-all-preparing-for-fall-quarter-2020-at-ucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not resume to norma</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">l by fall, and UCSB is prepared to continue remote instruction if that is the case.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Until there’s a vaccine, we’re going to be living in somewhat altered circumstances,” Marshall explained. He described a mixed approach to instruction involving a combination between online and in-person classes to reduce density and encourage social distancing. “Whatever arrangement we can make to have it be safe and effective,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, many </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-24/pandemic-pedagogy-faculty-prepares-for-first-quarter-of-remote-instruction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">professors would rather teach face-to-face</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> classes, but as more resources develop, their classes are slowly becoming accustomed to online formats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a lot of innovative teachers. They’ve also gotten help from their students who I think, in many cases, are more conversant, more comfortable, with technology,” Marshall said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adler-Kassner added that as both professors and students adapt to the situation, they’re helping each other create an efficient space for both sides of the screen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s helpful for students when they know we faculty are doing the best that we can and trying to sort of think about things,” Adler-Kassner said. “It’s also helpful for faculty to really hear about the student experience.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are things that we are learning from this experience that can improve our teaching overall.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94450\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-16/a-spectrum-of-support-how-ucsb-is-helping-instructors-teach-through-a-pandemic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94450\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-16/a-spectrum-of-support-how-ucsb-is-helping-instructors-teach-through-a-pandemic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-16/a-spectrum-of-support-how-ucsb-is-helping-instructors-teach-through-a-pandemic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-16/a-spectrum-of-support-how-ucsb-is-helping-instructors-teach-through-a-pandemic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-16/a-spectrum-of-support-how-ucsb-is-helping-instructors-teach-through-a-pandemic/","id":1827,"author":{"id":279,"name":"Melea Maglalang"},"related":[1826,1825,1824],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":279,"name":"Melea Maglalang","biography":"Not available","articles":[1823,1827],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Senate’s unallocated budget, which is not designated for spending on a specific topic. The fund, provided by students through campus fees, will have $88,688.30 left after the transfer to the Financial Crisis Response Team (FCRT) and Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) offices, according to the resolution. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was really important that we use some of our excess student fees that the students have paid into A.S. in the first place,” Ferguson said. “This is their money and it deserves to be going towards things that will be helping them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FCRT, which helps students facing financial difficulties through a variety of services such as housing rent vouchers, will disperse the money among students who need it most based on the response team’s general review process, according to Rebecca Plotkin, the basic needs coordinator in the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships and a member of the FCRT.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EOP provides </span><a href=\"http://eop.sa.ucsb.edu/services/grant\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S./EOP</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> grants to students facing specific financial needs, such as medical costs, according to Aaron Jones, director of the EOP; he added that the EOP office currently has roughly $4,000 left for A.S./EOP grants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there is no set date for the organizations to receive the money, Ferguson said he expects A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez, who is directed by the resolution to transfer the funds, to do so “promptly.” After the FCRT and EOP distribute the funds, Marquez will write a report about how the money was spent and present it to the A.S. Senate, according to Ferguson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Normally, the unallocated funds would be used to fund student groups or various projects. The bill’s second author, Off-Campus Senator Daniel Segura-Esquivel, said that because of the remote nature of spring quarter, the money would be best spent helping students who are reeling from the financial impact of the coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a lot of financial insecurity that people are facing, especially with a lot of them losing their jobs, losing out on income that they were expecting,” Segura said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that the remaining money in the budget is for “emergency situations or just things … we don’t foresee that we can’t really plan ahead for.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93922\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-10/a-s-senate-allocates-80000-to-student-relief-groups-to-support-those-affected-by-coronavirus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93922\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-10/a-s-senate-allocates-80000-to-student-relief-groups-to-support-those-affected-by-coronavirus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-10/a-s-senate-allocates-80000-to-student-relief-groups-to-support-those-affected-by-coronavirus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-10/a-s-senate-allocates-80000-to-student-relief-groups-to-support-those-affected-by-coronavirus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-10/a-s-senate-allocates-80000-to-student-relief-groups-to-support-those-affected-by-coronavirus/","id":1824,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[1823,1822,1821],"comments":[{"id":"8ea7d3f8-89e6-49e9-9602-7e32ad6a0035","name":"Sample User 1","email":"nicholasjbarak@gmail.com","parent":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

The team works remotely now, but Wood considered the transition “fairly seamless.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, Wood’s team spends “more time than usual” helping instructors — who’ve never used GauchoSpace in any significant capacity — navigate the platform and tailor their classes to an online curriculum. Wood added that his team needed to help many instructors set up and use the testing options on GauchoSpace. Not all instructors use GauchoSpace to conduct exams, but there have been disputes between university members and proctoring services, such as </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-16/ucsb-faculty-association-issues-letter-advising-against-the-use-of-proctoru-testing-services/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ProctorU</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, about privacy concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Testing administered through GauchoSpace is by far the biggest use of data on the platform, especially due to remote learning, according to Diane Soini, GauchoSpace’s learning management system programmer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you have 800 people and the quiz closes all at once for all of them, all of a sudden, several systems have to calculate everybody’s grade and submit all of their submissions,” Soini said. “It’s a pretty big hit to the system.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GauchoSpace Development and Support team can monitor exams with tight deadlines in real time in order to respond quickly to issues that could occur during the testing period, according to Soini.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wood manages seven graduate student instructional design assistants who help the website perform various tasks, with the bulk of their work spent helping professors and teaching assistants successfully utilize the platform. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With midterms in full swing, the challenge of adapting tests and quizzes to an online platform  while maintaining the tests’ rigor and difficulty level has kept the design assistants busy answering questions and concerns from instructors. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can provide advice on what question types to use, and depending on how instructors would prefer to grade their midterms, what settings to use and we address a lot of concerns about cheating,” Erica Johnson, an instructional design assistant, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although cheating remains an issue for some professors, Johnson said the opportunity to cheat is unlikely to disappear.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t say that there’s a way to completely prevent cheating and sharing of answers, but there are some measures that we can take in the online tools that we use to minimize that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson added that essay-style questions, randomizing the order of questions and answers and time limits are all effective tools for preventing cheating over GauchoSpace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another instructional design assistant, Jonathan Downey, added that the graduate students were generally working more hours now, with most of the graduate students working on average 20 hours a week </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">double the hours of last quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of grad students will be TAs and whatnot, this is kind of what I do in lieu of that,” Downey said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GauchoSpace, which was built on an open-source platform called Moodle, allows the support team to share tips with other universities about how they’ve learned to adapt GauchoSpace using Moodle under the new circumstances. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Utilising Moodle’s open-source software, programmers across different universities can share how they’ve solved bugs and shortened the time a support team needs to troubleshoot, according to Hector Gonzalez, GauchoSpace’s instructional applications programmer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While UCSB announced Tuesday that all </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/all-summer-sessions-to-be-conducted-remotely-university-announces/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">summer sessions </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">would be carried out through remote instruction, the fate of in-person classes for fall quarter remains uncertain. Until the university makes its decision, the GauchoSpace team will need to keep up its increased support level.  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re definitely going to need to maintain that elevated level of support,” Wood said. “I would say that’s what we’re anticipating.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94319\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/gauchospace-sees-increased-visits-new-challenges-amid-remote-instruction-transition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94319\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/gauchospace-sees-increased-visits-new-challenges-amid-remote-instruction-transition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/gauchospace-sees-increased-visits-new-challenges-amid-remote-instruction-transition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/gauchospace-sees-increased-visits-new-challenges-amid-remote-instruction-transition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/gauchospace-sees-increased-visits-new-challenges-amid-remote-instruction-transition/","id":1826,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[1825,1824,1823],"comments":[{"id":"ed41853a-c670-4b77-b404-4d428a2eb3a9","name":"Sample User 4","email":"mocknexus@gmail.com","parent":null,"content":"Proin diam magna, aliquam at justo in, pharetra blandit orci.
