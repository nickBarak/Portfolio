AAAC is organizing the event with the United States Student Association, the Associated Students (A.S.) Office of the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA), the A.S. Office of the Student Advocate and UCSB-4-Bernie.</p>\n<p>Event organizer and second-year mathematics major Kyle Butts said the UC Board of Regents treats the University as more of a corporate entity than an academic institution, beginning when Ronald Reagan became governor of California.</p>\n<p>“Reagan ushered in an era of neoliberal thinking in California while he was governor,” Butts said. “That coupled with 17 Regents being business men who serve 12 year terms and only one student Regent, it is pretty clear that the UC is a business now to them.”</p>\n<p>According to Butts, the march will partially address how the 1960 California Master Plan for Higher Education, which reaffirmed California’s prior commitment to the principle of tuition-free education, has been abandoned.</p>\n<p>“This is evident in when Governor Schwarzenegger and the UC Regents met in 2004 for the Compact for Higher Education,” Butts said. “There they made clear that students and donations would be the primary sources of funding instead of state funding.”</p>\n<p>Butts said tuition-free college is attainable.</p>\n<p>“If we decide that it is time for our school to return to a true public university, we can make it happen,” Butts said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Residents of California did not have to pay to go to a university like UC Santa Barbara fifty years ago, so I ask what makes us different from the students 50 years ago. I say there is no difference.<br>\n–<em> Josephine Ampaw</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Event organizer and third-year political science and feminist studies double major Josephine Ampaw said she hopes the Teach In AAAC hosted last week succeeded in educating students on tuition and debt and inspired attendees to affect change.</p>\n<p>“I hope this course of action will first off be taken seriously by our city, state and national leaders, who will execute a plan in order to make free higher education a reality after bringing the demands to the center stage,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p>According to Ampaw, accessible higher education is an investment in the future of the country.</p>\n<p>“I believe students have to fight for free tuition because education is a right, not a privilege,” Ampaw said. “Every person who lives in the state of California, in the United States and across the globe deserves the right to not only a elementary and secondary education, but to a higher education as well.”</p>\n<p>Ampaw said California has had tuition-free public higher education in the past.</p>\n<p>“Residents of California did not have to pay to go to a university like UC Santa Barbara fifty years ago, so I ask what makes us different from the students 50 years ago. I say there is no difference,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p>According to Butts, the demand for a $15 minimum wage for all UC workers aims to facilitate the “American Dream.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a whole class of people who aren’t given the same opportunity as middle and upper middle-status people. With expensive public education and a $9 minimum wage, they as a collective are not able to overcome poor conditions with hard work,” Butts said. “Instead, the Million Student March is trying to level the playing field and create accessible forms of social mobility.”</p>\n<p>Butts said UCSB is a hub for student political engagement.</p>\n<p>“Looking at the history of UCSB and the UC system as a whole, I think we’re the heart of the student movement,” Butts said. “By hosting the march here at UCSB, we’re simply entering the long history we’ve had in activism.”</p>\n<p>Second-year psychology major Hannah Houska said the “the fight is now” against tuition hikes, because UC’s tuition freeze will end at the 2017-18 academic year.</p>\n<p>“Our goal is not to continue the cycle of tuition hike and tuition freeze, but rather our goal is to lower tuition,” Houska said.</p>\n<p>According to Butts, #MillionStudentMarch will encourage students to be more politically active.</p>\n<p>“Come Thursday, it will be clear that frustration will bring students out,” Butts said. “It would be so easy to not come, but a million students across this country are going to have this issue be talked about, so activism is alive and well here at UCSB.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

mathematician Yitang Zhang will be joining UC Santa Barbara’s mathematics faculty this fall, a development many hope will add further prestige to the university.</p>\n<p>Zhang became famous in 2013 when he submitted a proof to the Annals of Mathematics which established the first finite bound on gaps between twin prime numbers, a feat many believed to be impossible. The New Yorker magazine published a profile on Zhang in February, and Filmmaker George Csicsery premiered a documentary on Zhang called “Counting from Infinity” in January. Zhang’s major breakthrough earned him numerous awards and honors, including the 2013 Ostrowski Prize, the 2014 Frank Nelson Cole Prize in Number Theory, election to the Academia Sinica fellowship in 2014 and tenure professorship at the University of New Hampshire in 2014.<br>\nUCSB mathematics professor and number theory specialist Jeffrey Stopple said it is unusual for mathematicians to be featured in The New Yorker.</p>\n<p>“He’s probably at this point one of the most famous mathematicians in the world,” Stopple said. “I think there might be only maybe two or three others alive that have his level of celebrity.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang said he hosted Zhang’s visit to UCSB during a mathematics department colloquium in May and he personally invited Zhang to join the faculty as a professor.</p>\n<p>“I was honored to be able to host his visit to our campus and to invite him to become a professor, a colleague and a friend on our campus,” Yang said in an email.<br>\nAccording to UCSB professor emeritus in mathematics Martin Scharlemann, Zhang currently stands as one of the most prestigious professors at the university.</p>\n<p>“There are various types of prestige in mathematics. One is to be known by experts in your field and another is to be known by the general public,” Scharlemann said. “At least in the second category, he’s probably the most remarkable here at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>UCSB mathematics department chair and professor Darren Long said he hopes Zhang’s presence in UCSB’s math department will increase the amount of interactions between professors and expand the department’s range of research.</p>\n<p>“This is not an enormous department, so we don’t have representation in every field possible,” Long said. “He is somebody that opens up a vista in that way.”<br>\nAccording to Stopple, hiring Zhang will significantly increase the university’s prestige and will attract even more students in the future.</p>\n<p>“I think it raises the profile of the campus enormously,” Stopple said. “In terms of recruiting new students at UCSB, I think at all levels people will want to be here.”</p>\n<p>Long said he offered Zhang a reduced teaching load to start, but assumes Zhang will want to increase it because of his extensive teaching history at the University of New Hampshire.</p>\n<p>“It is my impression that he will want to teach undergraduates from time to time,” Long said. “I expect he will succeed.”</p>\n<p>University of Massachusetts Boston mathematics professor and former University of New Hampshire’s mathematics department chair Eric Grinberg said Zhang has always been a humble faculty member, despite his worldwide fame.</p>\n<p>“He was always very modest and unassuming and he certainly never boasted of anything,” Grinberg said. “Even though he’s become world famous, I don’t think that’s changed too much.”</p>\n<p>Grinberg said students at the University of New Hampshire found Zhang’s teaching style to be “very much accessible” and “easy to follow.”</p>\n<p>“Some people might try to impress everybody by how deep their work is and get them lost in technicalities,” Grinberg said. “Yitang Zhang doesn’t do that.”</p>\n<p>Stopple said Zhang’s next goal is to solve the Landau-Siegel Theorem, an important piece of a larger and more difficult problem called the Riemann Hypothesis, a 150 year-old mathematical conjecture with a one million dollar prize attached to it.</p>\n<p>“He sets his sights very high and I’m very impressed by him,” Stopple said. “Even the piece that he’s working on would make him famous all over again if he wasn’t already famous.”</p>\n<p>Stopple said it is unlikely Zhang will be able to solve the Landau-Siegel Theorem during his time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“In some sense, it would be like someone being struck by lightning twice,” Stopple said. “It’s ambitious to try, but he’s the guy who’s willing to try stuff like that.”</p>\n<p>Yang said UCSB is an ideal place for Zhang to teach while also conducting research.</p>\n<p>“Our campus provides both the intellectual environment and spectacular beauty for him to enjoy continuing his research to solve unsolvable math problems while also teaching our students,” Yang said in an email.</p>\n<p>Yitang Zhang was unavailable for comment.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 in the Thursday, Sept. 17, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
