I haven’t surfed in about a week, and the couple of weeks before this one I was only able to surf a few tantalizing times. Sweet, but not filling.</p>\n<p>I’ve constantly chided myself for having priorities that take me away from the calm and consciousness of the sea. Throughout my time in I.V., the ocean’s presence mere yards (and a cliff face) away has been a constant that I’ve been able to turn to when all else is havoc. Stress factors run rampant in the university setting, especially when one tries to have a personal life and a budding professional one as well.</p>\n<p>The ocean is an life force responsible for a lot of what is good in the world. I believe in it and in a strange way I also almost worship it. It’s hard to completely explain the swelling of spirit that a simple float in a chilly sea will give you. The force of the ocean emphasizes the inevitability of life, that humanity’s mark on the cosmic timeline is a miniscule blip – fragile, nondescript and apt to fade from existence as naturally and easily as a tide pulling a piece of driftwood from shore. For some reason I find that comforting – it makes me feel like a part of the grand scheme of the world, not like someone embedded in a frantic society that can’t get its wits about it.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The wonders of the sea are vivid and incredible. I never grow tired of being in and around great tidal bodies, nor could I exhaust my appreciation for the ocean’s marvels and quirks. I have pledged to myself to never underestimate the power of the ocean. For those of you who’ve been following my column, that was another Surfer’s Code reference (Read it! It’s by Shaun Thompson.).</p>\n<p>We all know the statistic that more is known about outer space than about the depths of Earth’s oceans. It’s almost like an alternate reality, full of massive volcanoes, giant trenches, and eight-legged magicians possessing the ability to wrestle sharks and shoot ink. The anglerfish, for example, strikes me as a particularly vivid representation of the wonders of the sea and its citizens; it has a fleshy growth protruding from its forehead that functions as a lure. Some deep-sea anglerfish even produce an eerie light from their lure – you’ve probably already seen a demonic representation of this same fish in Finding Nemo.</p>\n<p>Last Saturday, I had arrived home from a chaotic day with the light fading. Rather than attempting to enjoy a crazy I.V. party that night, a good friend and I loaded up with frozen squid, raw chicken, fishing poles, and all the necessary late-night fishing accoutrement. The pier was a happy reality. Couples strolled down the planked walkway to enjoy the ocean’s aura, scuba divers popped up out of the dark water below with loud exhalations and chatted to each other about the crabs they had seen on the bottom. Life was simple. I didn’t get to surf this week, but at least I have that experience fresh in my mind.</p>\n<p>As much as I might gain from keeping my insight about the wonders of the ocean to myself, I’m more passionate about ending the misery of those who have spent the majority of their existence landlocked or unappreciative of the sea. It’s right there, and it’s good for you.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

Recreation’s website. <em>Will Tran / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project began in the spring of 2017 and opened around early March 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The track was “in terrible shape” due to damage from tree roots, according to Jeff Huskey, director for the Department of Recreation at UCSB. He said the track was originally built in the 1950s and was officially named Pauley Track in 1974 after Edwin W. Pauley, who was a donor to several UCs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pauley Track was “previously deemed unsuitable for competitive use and lacked adequate lighting,” according to the UCSB Department of Recreation’s website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The track was reconstructed several times but the tree roots were such a problem the track needed an entirely new structure, Huskey said. The most recent construction project is the first work that has been done on the track in recent years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Huskey, the track was in such bad shape that it had not been used to host an event since 2010. To fix the root problem, a root barrier was placed between the track and the surrounding trees. Lights were added to the track as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The total cost of the track renovation was approximately $2.6 million, according to Huskey. The costs were funded primarily through the “Flip the Switch For Student Recreation” student fee passed in 2013.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The remodeling of the track was one of the three phases in the remodeling of the athletic fields. The other phases were repairing Robertson Gymnasium and using artificial turf on the track, according to Huskey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The track is open at approximately sunrise and closes around 11:30 p.m. The track is open specifically for UCSB students, but is still considered open to the general public.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John McCutcheon, the director of intercollegiate athletics, welcomed everyone and thanked everyone who supported the “Flip the Switch” vote during the grand opening on Wednesday. He also thanked the Cheadle family and the Pauley Foundation for their financial support. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brittney Johnson, a fourth-year on UCSB’s track team, expressed enthusiasm about the renovation to students, student-athletes and donors in attendance and thanked them all for their contributions. She told the crowd about how the team would practice on the previously unfit track and said it was a point of pride and an example of their work ethic to continue to practice in poor conditions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Practicing on the turf showed the resilience of this team,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Margaret Klawunn, vice-chancellor of student affairs, also thanked the donors for putting together Wednesday’s event, which she said was “an unusual project with great leadership.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the event’s organizers cut the blue ribbon signaling the grand opening of the track, students joined by athletes led the way in the first lap since the track’s opening.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The track will be hosting its first event since its renovation next week against the Cal Poly Mustangs on Saturday, April 28.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82634\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-22/pauley-track-reopens-after-over-a-year-in-construction/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82634\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-22/pauley-track-reopens-after-over-a-year-in-construction/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-22/pauley-track-reopens-after-over-a-year-in-construction/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-22/pauley-track-reopens-after-over-a-year-in-construction/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-22/pauley-track-reopens-after-over-a-year-in-construction/","id":2785,"author":{"id":226,"name":"Phillip Snoddy"},"related":[2784,2783,2782],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Green Advice for Green People:  For Every Fantasy Injury, an Upside","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"For coaches as well as fantasy owners, an injury to a star player can decimate playoff hopes.

But no matter who gets hurt, the season rolls on.  You need to be able to roll with it. No matter how much that boo-boo hurts, there is no crying in football, so slap a bandage on it and read on.</p>\n<p>There is no way to know who is going to get injured or when, so there is very little you can do to prepare. However, you can look at the depth charts.</p>\n<p>It’s the first thing every fantasy owner should do when you first draft players: Know the depth charts of the teams of the players you drafted. You don’t need to spend hours studying rosters. Just know who the second and third string guys are and which player is more likely to step up should your starter sustain an injury. If you have a spot available on your roster, it is also a good idea to pick up one of the backups, just in case that starter does go down.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Let’s start with the Kansas City Chiefs, who recently lost their starting running back, Clinton Portis, for 4-6 weeks. When Portis returns, he could regain at least a share of the starting role.  For now, the Chiefs will probably insert their number two running back, Ryan Torain, into the starting role. In the few opportunities he has been given so far this season, Torain has racked up 156 yards on 41 attempts — over three yards per carry — and one touchdown.</p>\n<p>While last week’s 40-yard performance against Green Bay was disappointing, Torain has shown in previous efforts that he has the ability to get the job done. More importantly, he has the support of Head Coach Mike Shanahan and very little in the way of competition from other guys in the Kansas City depth chart, so he has a lot of value while Portis is out. Torain is still available in almost 20 percent of ESPN leagues, but he is going fast.</p>\n<p>At the wide receiver position, owners of Rams wide receiver Mark Clayton will be disappointed to learn that after injuring his knee on Sunday, Clayton will be forced to miss the rest of the season. However, though his season is lost, his owners still have a chance to salvage theirs. If you look at the Rams’ depth chart you will see that rookie wide receiver Mardy Gilyard, who can be picked up in almost 100% of leagues, is set to take on an extended role in the Rams’ offense. While it is unlikely that Gilyard will instantly match Clayton’s level of production, someone is going to have to catch those extra passes from quarterback Sam Bradford. Gilyard is worth a look from anyone who owned Clayton.</p>\n<p>That same rule applies for owners of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who may not be able to play in week six. If you have no other viable replacement, Packers backup QB, rookie Matt Flynn, would be a wise add for this week — if only as a precaution. In the event that Rodgers can’t play, Flynn will take over the offense for the week and for that reason could provide a solid fantasy performance for any owner willing to gamble on him.</p>\n<p>Knowing who stands to replace who in the event of an injury is all fine and dandy, but it will only get you so far if you don’t understand how individual coaches handle injuries. This brings us to the second point in dealing with injuries: Know how different coaches react to losing a starter. Some coaches will simply put in the guy who is next on the depth chart and wait until the starter returns. Others, however, are not that simple.</p>\n<p>Saints Head Coach Sean Peyton exemplifies a coach who tends to replace injured starters with committees of healthy players, making it difficult to know who is going to get the bulk of the work from week to week. Peyton, for example, has chosen to fill the hole left by starting running back Pierre Thomas with a committee of Ladell Betts and Chris Ivory. Although Betts has been productive on his own in the past, it will be difficult to predict how often he will touch the ball while sharing carries with Ivory. This ends up negating any potential value of either player, since neither can be relied upon to produce consistently. Any owner who picks up either Betts or Ivory without first knowing how Peyton deals with injuries would be making a mistake.</p>\n<p>Star players get injured just like anyone else. In all likelihood, you won’t find other stars to replace them. Still, most owners fail to take into account the fact that someone needs to fill the void that the injured player left on his team, and that the replacement player will have value as long as the star is injured. By knowing how coaches like to handle injuries and who is next in line on the depth chart, you may be able to prevent an injury from harming your playoff chances. Real men may play through injuries, but real fantasy owners work around them.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus <em>Staff Writer Josh Greenberg is a real man and a real fantasy owner.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27325\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-injury-upside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27325\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-injury-upside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-injury-upside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-injury-upside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-injury-upside/","id":2786,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2785,2784,2783],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Zsombor Vincze: The Hungarian Hurricane","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Senior utility Zsombor Vincze of the men’s water polo team is unique both in and out of the water.

There he met Bruce Wigo, the tournament director, whose son Wolf Wigo coached at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Bruce mentioned that his son was looking for players. Enamored by the American lifestyle, Vincze agreed.</p>\n<p>“I talked to Wolf [Wigo] on the phone and was immediately in,” the Hungarian native said.</p>\n<p>Vincze was soon on a plane to Santa Barbara to begin his life in America. In the water, the then-freshman immediately made an impact, earning All-MPSF Honorable Mention Team honors after scoring 30 goals and dishing out 23 assists. The following year, he accumulated 46 more goals and 25 assists to earn the same conference honors. After sitting out 2008 with a medical red-shirt, Vincze earned his third honorable mention award in 2009.</p>\n<p>“He has a lot of great aspects to his game,” freshman driver Matt Gronow said. “He is an amazing shooter, real smart, surprisingly fast and strong as hell.”</p>\n<p>Although he adapted quickly to American water polo, Vincze initially struggled with English.</p>\n<p>“I had to carry a pocket dictionary with me everywhere,” Vincze said. “And I couldn’t express myself emotionally for the first year.”</p>\n<p>Although he could not convey his emotions, Vincze said his most difficult struggle involved the use of humor.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t able to joke,” Vincze said. “And that’s an essential part of me.”</p>\n<p>Last year at a women’s water polo game, Vincze and some friends performed synchronized swimming, which the crowd received favorably.</p>\n<p>“Everybody thought it was hilarious,” Golic said.</p>\n<p>Despite developing the ability to joke, some of Vincze’s friends jokingly insist his English still is not up to par.</p>\n<p>According to Gronow, Vincze’s roommate, Vincze has an “annoying” habit where he finds new English words that he likes and will perpetually say them.</p>\n<p>“I like the flavor of some words,” the Hungarian native said. “And I will create circumstances where it [the word] has to pop-up.”</p>\n<p>Another language quirk for Vincze is his use of abbreviations. Vincze abhors the use of mediated abbreviations such as</p>\n<p>“LOL,” “WTF,” and “OMG.” To poke fun at his roommates, Vincze uses them in everyday spoken conversation, starting a trend on the team.</p>\n<p>According to his roommates, Vincze also has terrible taste in music.</p>\n<p>“His music taste is horrible,” Gronow said. “He likes crap and will play his Hungarian music to the maximum volume and sing along.”</p>\n<p>Vincze disagrees with Gronow.</p>\n<p>“I have the most sophisticated taste in music,” Vincze said. “Matty’s taste is horrible.”</p>\n<p>Golic, a fellow Eastern European, agrees with Vincze on this issue.</p>\n<p>“I think his taste is great,” Golic said. “He knows good music for sure.”</p>\n<p>According to his teammates, Vincze has several other quirks, including pre-game rituals that red-shirt freshman Paddy Kelleher calls “ridiculous Hungarian stretches.”</p>\n<p>“Some of them probably shouldn’t be done in a speedo,” he said.</p>\n<p>Like all athletes, Vincze appreciates his rest. However, he probably appreciates it a little more. The Hungary native uses the aid of a sound machine to sleep.</p>\n<p>“He sleeps with a little sound machine to calm him, like a baby,” Golic said. “We all make fun of him for it.”</p>\n<p>Vincze and the rest of the squad play again at Campus Pool on Oct. 23 at 12 p.m. in a conference match against Long Beach State.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27629\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-18/zsombor-vincze-hungarian-hurricane/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27629\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-18/zsombor-vincze-hungarian-hurricane/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-18/zsombor-vincze-hungarian-hurricane/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-18/zsombor-vincze-hungarian-hurricane/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-18/zsombor-vincze-hungarian-hurricane/","id":2787,"author":{"id":295,"name":"Ryan Eagleson"},"related":[2786,2785,2784],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
