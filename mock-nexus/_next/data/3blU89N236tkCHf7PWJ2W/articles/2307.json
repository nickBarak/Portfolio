However, they have surpassed their previous records, as this is the first year that both teams have qualified for O.R.C.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact that we were able to qualify and be put on the same playing field as our A team and qualify alongside schools that don’t take us seriously really means a lot to me, coming in as an underdog,” B Captain and Secretary Zenia Safadi said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team is student-run and receives part-time assistance from a UCSB alum who acts as an attorney coach, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to Poroj.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That fact has been disadvantageous due to the huge time commitments, no attorney coaches, high tournament fees, and travel expenses,” Poroj said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though this is the team’s biggest accomplishment to date, they have been steadily increasing their status as a nationally known team. In 2014, the team took first place in the Yale University Invitational, and this past January they hosted Mocktopia, the second-largest tournament on the West Coast. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suebert praised her teammates for their motivation and persistence, a combination of which gives them “the Umph,” as the Executive Board calls it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though they are not sure of what to expect from their first-ever tournament, during which they will compete against teams from Harvard, Yale, Stanford and other Ivy League schools, Poroj believes that this is a defining moment in the team’s transformation as a team in it for fun, but also one that will “kick ass and take names.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since we have never made it to Nationals before, we do not know what to expect, but we do know that only the best of the best will be competing … so we are going to Minneapolis with guns blazing,” Treasurer Janice Espindola said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team has started a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/ucsb-mock-trial-nationals\">GoFundMe</a> to help pay for the trip to Nationals. </span></p>\n<p><i>Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the team did not have a coach.

To view them just on a basis of names, it would seem as though player value begins to drop off around the 10th spot on each list. But if you look carefully, you will find low-ranked players who still produce solid numbers and may even still be available in your league.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at ESPN’s rankings. On its list of the top quarterbacks, ESPN has Matt Schaub of the Houston Texans ranked 6th, while Chad Henne of the Miami Dolphins is ranked 14 spots lower at #20. Schaub has almost 200 more yards passing than Henne, has a higher QB rating, and has thrown for two more touchdowns, making it seem as though Schaub is the obvious choice over Henne. But to be a successful fantasy owner, you are going to need to look a bit deeper. Take Henne and Schaub. Despite his numbers, Schaub has only scored nine more fantasy points than Henne. Why? Interceptions. Schaub has thrown four interceptions to Henne’s one. </p>\n<p>So while Schaub has had the more explosive season, he is also more likely to hurt you fantasy-wise. And while Schaub is owned in 100 percent of ESPN leagues, Henne is still available in almost 33 percent of leagues. The contrast is even more striking when you compare Henne to ESPN’s #11 quarterback, Eli Manning, who, despite also being owned in 100 percent of ESPN leagues, has actually put up fewer fantasy points than Henne. It is because of players like Henne that free agency can be an owner’s best friend. Every now and then there will be a player who is flying under the radar but is still producing at the level of a highly ranked player. If you pay attention, you might find one.</p>\n<p>Here are a few more numbers. Maurice Jones-Drew, running back for the Jacksonville Jaguars, is ESPN’s fourth-ranked running back. He has scored a grand total of 20 fantasy points and is owned in 100 percent of leagues. The 40th and 41st ranked running backs, Jason Snelling and Mike Tolbert, have put up 41 and 29 fantasy points respectively, and are both still available in almost 40 percent of leagues. St. Louis Rams wide receiver Mark Clayton, who can still be picked up in 23 percent of leagues, is ranked 30th by ESPN despite scoring nine more fantasy points than sixth-ranked receiver Greg Jennings.</p>\n<p>My point is this: Just because you missed out on the top ten players does not mean you can’t put together a strong team. Instead of memorizing all the bullshit the analysts at ESPN or any other fantasy football site come up with, do some actual research. Track performances each week and keep a close eye on the free agents in your league, because more likely than not, you will find something that somebody else missed.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus staff writer Josh Greenberg spends his days trolling free angency lists, and absolutely nothing else.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26209\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-29/green-advice-green-people-player-rankings-overrated/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26209\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-29/green-advice-green-people-player-rankings-overrated/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-29/green-advice-green-people-player-rankings-overrated/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-29/green-advice-green-people-player-rankings-overrated/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-29/green-advice-green-people-player-rankings-overrated/","id":2304,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2303,2302,2301],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Model U.N.

The opening ceremony will be held in Girvetz Hall, large committees will be in the Theater &amp; Dance Building, small committees will be in the Student Resource Building and the closing ceremony will be in Isla Vista Theater.</p>\n<p>According to SBIMUN Security Council Chair and fourth-year political science and Italian double major Jane Huson, their event is relatively new compared to those held at other universities and will provide students with good preparation for future MUN conferences.</p>\n<p>“Our conference is pretty new and more of an educational one since it is hosted in the fall and a lot of colleges send newer delegates so they can experience it in a less intimidating environment,” Huson said. “A lot of students will go to the New York MUN in the spring and the Berkeley MUN in the winter so this is a jumping off point for the students.”</p>\n<p>The number of travel conferences MUN will be able to attend depends on how much funding they collect from hosting home conferences. The team is planning to attend conferences in New York, Davis, Berkeley and Los Angeles this school year.</p>\n<p>Chair of SBIMUN Human Rights Council and third-year global studies Benjamin Pu said the conference will be a great learning opportunity for many students.</p>\n<p>“This is a great training conference, and for many schools it will be the first conference of the year,” Pu said. “We provide a thorough and rigorous environment for rules and procedures and also emphasize educational aspects as well.”</p>\n<p>Huson said around 400 to 450 delegates from 18 universities throughout California are expected to be at the conference, including UC San Diego, UC Davis, University of Southern California and Stanford University.</p>\n<p>Chair of SBIMUN World Food Program and first-year pre-economics Jason Tsao said he looks forward to the event.</p>\n<p>“This is my first time chairing for a MUN conference and even though it’s going to be a long three days, I’m excited,” Tsao said. “There are training sessions held weekly and that’s where delegates will learn what to do at the conferences.”</p>\n<p>According to Huson, there will be four committee sessions spread out over three days with the opening ceremony introducing chairs, committees and a guest speaker. Each committee will have two topics for discussion and will be chaired by MUN students.</p>\n<p>Huson said MUN members can learn how to be better delegates through hosting a conference.</p>\n<p>“Conferences are super helpful because students are chairing and facilitating the debates,” Huson said. “Chairs who are members will see what makes people good delegates so when they go to travel conferences they can know how to better behave and win prizes and learn what goes into writing a good resolution.”</p>\n<p>MUN will host two more annual conferences, the Gaucho Model United Nations High School Conference and the Central Coast Scrimmage, on Feb. 14-15 and May 2 respectively.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58011\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/model-u-n-to-host-fifth-annual-conference-friday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58011\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/model-u-n-to-host-fifth-annual-conference-friday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/model-u-n-to-host-fifth-annual-conference-friday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/model-u-n-to-host-fifth-annual-conference-friday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/model-u-n-to-host-fifth-annual-conference-friday/","id":2306,"author":{"id":124,"name":"Josephine Niu"},"related":[2305,2304,2303],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stalker Reportedly Harassing Women After UCSB Lectures","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-03-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/policephoto.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/policephoto.jpg?resize=600%2C429&ssl=1","description":"The suspect has allegedly stalked and harassed multiple women in the past week.\r\n\r\n","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police are looking for a male UC Santa Barbara student who they say has stalked and harassed multiple women in the past week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suspect has asked women for their phone numbers after classes, the UCSB Police Department (UCPD) announced in a university alert. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the suspect feels ignored, he proceeds to harass the women, following them on social media, sending derogatory text and social media messages, and, in some cases, showing up at their residence,” the alert read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD is investigating the crime.
