Yang. Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs, also presented updates on all of the demands</em>. Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“Not enough [people] participate in the resistance against the continuation of the perpetuation of rape culture,” said Ro’Shawndra Earvin, a UCSB student and a lead speaker at May’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\">sit-in</a>, as she opened the meeting with a statement expressing her continued frustration.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara administrators led Tuesday’s panel in Harold Frank Hall, speaking on behalf of Chancellor Henry T. Yang. Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs, also presented updates on each of the demands.</p>\n<p>The panel included Katya Armistead, dean of student life; Kim Equinoa, assistant dean of students; Briana Conway, director of Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.); Jeanne Stanford, director of Counseling and Psychological Services; Diane O’Brien, executive assistant to Yang<strong>; </strong>and Cathy Farley, assistant chief for the UC Police Department.</p>\n<p>Earvin expressed her frustration at the university’s handling of the demands, saying Armistead failed to solicit students to join committees to comply with the demands through a university announcement.</p>\n<p>“Ro Earvin, in unity with the A.N.W.O branch of UCSB and the Student Activist Network are looking for students interested in working on committees created for the demands signed May 4th 2017 in response to the University’s response to Sexual Assault. And for more information to contact me at <em>r.smivsb@gmail.com</em> with the demand(s) interested in working on and a schedule,” Earvin said in her email to UC administration.</p>\n<p>Armistead said she misunderstood Earvin’s request and sent out an email advertising Tuesday’s town hall to all students.</p>\n<p>Following Earvin’s opening statement, attendees received updates on each of the 12 demands made by nowUCsb, an organization which strives to “expose and reform broken campus policies on sexual violence” according to the group’s Facebook page.</p>\n<p>The administration marked each demand as “incomplete,” “complete” or “in progress.” The panel then provided specific information on the progress of each demand.</p>\n<p>The first demand was to create and fund a survivor resource center in Isla Vista. According to Klawunn, the university provides legal and counseling services for survivors, despite there being no “one-stop shop” for these resources. The demand was marked as incomplete, but the panel said it was interested in looking further into the matter.</p>\n<p>The second demand, which said C.A.P.S. must provide adequate and timely mental health services to survivors and their families, was marked as in progress.</p>\n<p>C.A.R.E. Director Conway said the organization now has eight staff members, which she described as its largest staff ever. She said C.A.P.S. has also diversified the days and times for group counseling and activities.</p>\n<p>The third demand sought mandatory sensitivity trainings for UCPD and the I.V. Foot Patrol that address race, gender, class and sexuality in connection to sexual assault and interpersonal violence.</p>\n<p>Assistant UCPD Chief Farley said UCPD and the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office attended a three-day training this August. Additionally, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/detective-joins-ivfp-following-student-protests-demands/\">IVFP hired a new detective</a>, Julio Gutierrez, to handle sexual assault and interpersonal violence in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Klawunn said demand four, asking Santa Barbara City College to be more transparent about students who have been disciplined for Title IX violations, is complete.</p>\n<p>UCSB Title IX director Ariana Alvarez will be collaborating with the Title IX director at SBCC.</p>\n<p>The seventh demand, for survivors of sexual assault and interpersonal violence to be able to transfer to a different university, is already in practice, Klawunn said. The UC facilitates UC-to-UC transfers for survivors.</p>\n<p>Demand 10, which required integrating Queer Connect, an educational workshop that focuses on sexual assault, dating violence and stalking within LGBTQ communities, to reporting and trainings, was also implemented and officially began at the beginning of Fall Quarter, according to Conway.</p>\n<p>The remaining seven demands were marked incomplete, but members of the panel assured those in attendance they are working to meet them.</p>\n<p>Demand six ordered administration to work with the I.V. CSD to create a report card for government institutions and law enforcement agencies for behaviors and education surrounding rape and sexual assault in I.V. Earvin marked that demand six has not been satisfied.</p>\n<p>The university is unable to meet demand eight for increased lighting on Slough Road because the Coastal Commission will not approve the change in infrastructure, according to Klawunn.</p>\n<p>Demand nine, to organize a meeting with all UC Chancellors on our UC Santa Barbara campus to develop system-wide level change, was not met “the way the demand is written,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>A UC-level sexual assault policy training review was held in September.</p>\n<p>Demand 11 asked the UC president to conduct yearly campus tours, where they should hold a public sexual violence town hall at every UC campus once per year.</p>\n<p>Robin Holmes-Sullivan, UC vice president for student affairs, will instead hold a town hall at UCSB on Jan. 8.</p>\n<p>Demand 12 requested Chancellor Yang and his office regularly update students about the progress being made on these demands. Klawunn said the demand was incomplete and said Tuesday’s town hall was one way to update the public.</p>\n<p>After the panel discussed their progress on each of the 12 demands, the floor became open for the approximately 30 students present to ask questions. The panel also answered anonymously submitted questions.</p>\n<p>Attendees asked why the UC administration has the funds for <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-28/advertisements-cost-uc-santa-barbara-up-to-30k-for-halloween-weekend/\">Halloween ads</a> but not to meet the 12 demands. Others asked whether programs like Gaucho FYI and Haven are enough to combat rape culture.</p>\n<p>The public made suggestions to the panel regarding addressing rape culture at places like the Student Leadership Retreat, where many leaders of organizations gather for training each year.</p>\n<p>They also mentioned the newly-introduced UC Title IX Student Advisory Board and asked if the students chosen to serve on this board would be compensated for the time commitment required to be on the board.</p>\n<p>Armistead agreed that students who serve on the board should be compensated.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Nov. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

According to Mitchell, she never once asked them to describe their sexual assault experience out of respect for the witnesses.</p>\n<p>“Okay, what if that was me and I’m sitting there in the movie theater super overwhelmed and the whole world is watching the worst thing that ever happened to me … I wouldn’t want that,” Mitchell said. “The first question I ask them is, ‘why did you decide to testify?’”</p>\n<p>Mitchell said it takes courage for the witnesses to speak out, which is why she decided to keep any explicit depictions of the violence in the film.</p>\n<p>Human Rights Board Outreach and Publicity Coordinator Devin Sercu said the case is a pivotal point in history and UC Santa Barbara students could benefit from learning about the case, which she believes has roots in sociology, psychology and communication.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t really something that maybe a lot of people know about,” Sercu said. “I know that I didn’t know too much about this before we started organizing [the event] and it’s given me a lot of fresh perspective … These kinds of things affect us on a global perspective.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

id=\"caption-attachment-76914\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The building, located between Broida Hall and the UCSB Library, has been plagued by dry rot, damage from insects and steel beam corrosion. <em>Jose Arturo Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>After an inspection of the building by Van Sande Structural Consultants, campus building official Ed Schmittgen notified the university on Jan. 9 that the building was no longer safe due to dry rot, insect damage, steel beam corrosion and an inadequate amount of ventilation beneath the trailer’s floor.</p>\n<p>Schmittgen said there was also not enough seismic bracing within the building.</p>\n<p>Seismic bracing “prevents a building from moving laterally during a seismic event,” he said in an email.</p>\n<p>Such problems could weaken the building’s structure and lead to earthquake vulnerability, he said. The university informed students that they needed to evacuate the building within 45 days.</p>\n<p>The building is over 40 years old and serves as a gathering space for various cultural organizations, including El Congreso, Mujer de UCSB, Students for Justice in Palestine and conglomerate Mesa Directiva.</p>\n<p>After a seismic stabilization project that began during the week of Feb. 13 and concluded over Spring Break, the university has added 12 concrete pillars around the north and east sides of the building. These structures make the building more durable and resilient to earthquakes.</p>\n<p>“We essentially have more assurance now that the building is structurally stable than prior to this effort,” Schmittgen said.</p>\n<p>The addition of the concrete pillars has decreased the seismic risk of the building and is one of the steps stabilizing the building. The building will need further adjustments to fix a rotting part of the floor and the foundation of the building, which has suffered water damage.</p>\n<p>The remaining reparations will take place over the summer so students can continue to use El Centro throughout Spring Quarter. Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn said the administration is working with a group of students from El Centro to plan out the details of the project.</p>\n<p>“The seismic stabilization had to happen right away in order to keep the building in use this year, but the other part of the renovation, we’re outlining the scope of the project right now,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>According to Klawunn, pressure from the student groups that use El Centro prompted the administration to reconsider its options for the building’s future. Associated Students Senate passed a bill on Jan. 18 urging the university to preserve the historical building.</p>\n<p>“What really made the difference was students saying, ‘We don’t want the building out of commission,’” Klawunn said. “So then Design and Construction went back to see if there is any solution to this that could keep the building in operation.”</p>\n<p>Klawunn said the new solution was not driven by finances or the cost of a demolition project but rather by “what makes the most sense.” She said the plan allows students to access the building for the duration of the quarter.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, April 13, 2017 print issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/admins-opt-to-repair-el-centro/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/admins-opt-to-repair-el-centro/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/admins-opt-to-repair-el-centro/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/admins-opt-to-repair-el-centro/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/admins-opt-to-repair-el-centro/","id":2402,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2401,2400,2399],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Hold Vigil for Victims of Sutherland Springs Tragedy","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-11-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Texas-by-Sicheng-Wang-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Students and faculty sat around a collection of blue mini-LED candles during the vigil.
