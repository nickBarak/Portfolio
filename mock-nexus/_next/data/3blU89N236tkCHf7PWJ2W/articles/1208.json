Davis has been a coach for the UCSB tennis team since 2000, and he has done a terrific job. He has been the Big West Conference Coach of the Year a total of nine times and has led the tennis program to 10 Big West titles and NCAA appearances, including the ones during the outstanding year they had this year.</p>\n<p>The UCSB men’s tennis team went a solid 19-6 this year with Davis at the helm. This included a resounding 5-0 record in conference play and a respectable 6-3 record in home games. They ended their season with a 4-1 loss to the University of Mississippi in the NCAA Championship, but this was not all for nothing. The team showed out all season, and this included a 4-1 win against rival Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in the Big West Championship.</p>\n<p>Davis rallied the troops once again this season, and the team responded with an outstanding performance all year. He showed once again why he is one of the best — if not the best — coaches around and why he was invited to and honored at the ATP finals last year. He has taken the UCSB men’s tennis team from a good team to a great team, and his style of play has the Gauchos performing to the best of their ability, and they seemed to be firing on all cylinders before their loss to Ole Miss.

Santa Barbara then went on a tear through the Big West Conference, stringing together wins against opponents like Cal State Fullerton, Long Beach State and Cal Poly. Of the seven regular-season conference games they played in April, the Gauchos swept their opponents 4-0 a total of four times.</p>\n<p>The impressive run of seven-straight victories carried Santa Barbara to the No. 2 seed in the Big West Conference Tournament, while three more wins to extend its streak to 10 matches led to an eventual return to the Big West Championships, during which the team played Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Hawaii was responsible for the Gauchos’ sole blemish in their conference record, and the matchup between the two teams was extremely competitive. However, it was UCSB who was able to answer back against the Rainbow Wahine by winning the conference final match 4-1. The finish at the top of the Big West Conference punched the team’s ticket to the first round of the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Results of the NCAA selection chose UCSB to face the No. 47 UCLA Bruins. The Bruins were a familiar opponent for the Gauchos, who had played them during their non-conference schedule. The Bruins were able to win that match 4-0, clinching the doubles point and leaving three singles matches unfinished.</p>\n<p>The first-round meet between the two teams began with doubles play against the talented Bruin duo of freshman Ena Shibahara and junior Kristin Wiley. UCLA captured the doubles point after a loss by UCSB tandem junior Amanda Atanasson and senior Melissa Baker.</p>\n<p>In singles play, junior Palina Dubavets and senior Stefani Stojic tried to give the Gauchos an early leg up on the Bruins, but the play of No. 5 Shibahara and sophomore Alaina Miller was too much for the Gauchos’ standouts. Junior Terri Fleming clinched the meet for the Bruins after defeating Natalie Da Silveira. Yet again, it was the Bruins winning the match 4-0, clinching the doubles point and leaving three singles matches unfinished.</p>\n<p>Despite the early exit for the Gauchos, the team is still poised to be a contender in both the Big West and the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>The key players the Gauchos will be losing after this season are seniors Melissa Baker, Jaimee Gilbertson and Stefani Stojic. All three of these players were crucial to both UCSB Big West Championship titles and were key players in getting the team out of its regular-season slump this year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos end this season with a variety of accolades. The team has captured the first back-to-back conference titles since 1995 and 1996, which signaled the end years of UCSB’s six-straight Big West titles from 1991-96. The consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances were also the program’s first since then.</p>\n<p>It certainly was an exciting season to follow, as the women’s tennis program is taking steps toward returning to its glory of being one of the top-tier Big West teams.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77948\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/season-review-ucsb-womens-tennis-repeats-as-big-west-champs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77948\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/season-review-ucsb-womens-tennis-repeats-as-big-west-champs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/season-review-ucsb-womens-tennis-repeats-as-big-west-champs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/season-review-ucsb-womens-tennis-repeats-as-big-west-champs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/season-review-ucsb-womens-tennis-repeats-as-big-west-champs/","id":1205,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1204,1203,1202],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Morgan, Freund Set to Face No. 3 Florida in First Round of the NCAA Doubles Championship","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-05-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_MTennis-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_MTennis-11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite the team being knocked out a couple weeks ago, Morgan Mays and Simon Freund will team up one last time in hopes of making some noise in the NCAA doubles championships.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB men’s tennis returns once more as the final postseason bout is soon to be underway.

With their last defeat coming all the way back on April 10 versus UC Davis, this pair has proven time and time again that they’re able to compete at an elite level.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>On a specifically top-10 basis, Freund and Mays have gone 2-0.

Paired with Assistant Coach Blake Muller and his illustrious career at Stanford, the team was led by some of the greatest former talents.</p>\n<p>“I was really excited when I got here … I saw everyone really intent on changing the culture here.” Mays mentioned because previous to the 2013 season, Santa Barbara was not yet the Big West powerhouse we see today. The team was also nonfactors at a national scale, with all of their recent NCAA Tournament appearances being cut short in the Round of 64 mark. Their last most successful showing came back in 1997 when UCSB was ranked No. 17 in the nation and reached the Sweet 16 stage of the competition. Since then, and from the turn of the century, the Gauchos haven’t really played at that same sense of quality.</p>\n<p>During his junior year, Mays first began to see himself consistently lead the pack at the roster’s court one spot. He also became captain for the first time as an upperclassman.</p>\n<p>“It was another opportunity I looked very much forward to; [captaining] is a position of high responsibility and it meant that much more considering we were coming off a great year since we had won the Big West title,” he said.</p>\n<p>Mays followed this up by making the point that, early on, every season the team wanted to see exactly where they’d stack up in the conference; however, their expectations began to involve a pursuit of placement onto the ITA rankings. That same year, Mays posted a 17-11 singles record and a 13-9 in dual play, which earned him an All-Conference First Team Singles selection and an Honorable Mention in Doubles. The team went on to qualify as their conference’s first seed and claimed back to back Big West championships. “</p>\n<p>Starting last year, with the bringing in of newer and younger faces, was when I saw the tennis program’s culture first begin to change,” Mays said.</p>\n<p>Mays was referring to standout names like sophomores Anders Holm and Nicolas Moreno, as well as his doubles co-star junior Simon Freund. The identity of UCSB’s tennis program truly started to emerge as they began to set their goals high with a conference three-peat and potential upsets versus opposing top-tier programs.</p>\n<p>As this season’s campaign began to wind down, the accolades and record breaking began to pour in. UCSB’s late calendar win streak of 12 in a row handed them another Big West first seed which ultimately resulted in both a league and playoff clean sweep, granting the program their championship trifecta. Their overall season record of 19-6 had them at a .760 win percentage, which is the highest in franchise history and earned them the No. 37 ITA ranking. This national ranking finish also ended up being the program’s third-ever highest spot, with only the 1997 and 1998 teams both finishing top 25 in the nation.</p>\n<p>“This was the first time in a while that people started to notice us on a national stage … we faced four different top-10 teams in the early part of the season and managed a great performance against all of them,” he said.</p>\n<p>All in all, Morgan Mays was once again elected to the All-Conference First Team and even announced as the Big West Player of the Year. Davis also earned 2017’s Coach of the Year recognition. Regionally speaking, ITA also honored Mays with the Arthur Ashe Leadership and Sportsmanship Award and Muller as Assistant Coach of the Year.</p>\n<p>“Altogether it’s been an incredible year, I’m proud and I really believe the culture has shifted upwards from here. I truly think this program will excel and continue to win titles for years to come … all thanks to Marty and Blake, we all hope this mentality will keep growing.”</p>\n<p>Much praise can be passed on to the UCSB men’s tennis team, but there’s still more work left to be done. As for now, fans and Gauchos alike can surely be excited for more years of tennis court dominance thanks to a stellar youth core and a phenomenal coaching staff.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77938\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/changing-the-culture-how-mays-helped-shape-an-elite-tennis-program/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77938\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/changing-the-culture-how-mays-helped-shape-an-elite-tennis-program/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/changing-the-culture-how-mays-helped-shape-an-elite-tennis-program/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/changing-the-culture-how-mays-helped-shape-an-elite-tennis-program/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/changing-the-culture-how-mays-helped-shape-an-elite-tennis-program/","id":1206,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1205,1204,1203],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
