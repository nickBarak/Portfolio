","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s tennis team faces a huge week ahead as the Gauchos look to open conference play with an away game this Saturday at UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos (1-6 overall) find themselves in a significant slump heading into Saturday’s game against No. 42 ranked UC Irvine (3-4 overall), where they have lost their last four matches in a row. UC Irvine is one of the strongest competitors in the Big West that the Gauchos are set to meet. UCSB has been focusing heavily on mental strength and increased stamina thus far this season, and if the Gauchos want to come out of Irvine with the upset, they must dominate in these two aspects.</p>\n<p>“We have had a tough schedule this year,” junior April Scatliffe said. “It would be nice to go into our first conference match with some more wins for confidence, but we have definitely had some highlights so far. We know we have what it takes to do well this weekend. Irvine is the toughest Big West competitor that we will face, so we have to go into the match super determined and aggressive to pull of the win.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In their last match at home against Pacific, the Gauchos dropped a very tough decision 6-1. Many of the matches were close, but the Gauchos fell short nearly every time, with four of the six singles matches decided by a third set tiebreak.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have been plagued with injuries so far this season, and as a result, have been shifting their starting lineup quite frequently. The Gauchos have had three different starters at the first singles position thus far, and have really been trying to find their strongest lineup. However, in the case of this weekend’s match against UC Irvine, UCSB looks to be the healthiest it has been all season long with players returning to the court from injuries.</p>\n<p>Irvine has had a decent season for being ranked No. 42 by the NCAA. They have defeated strong opponents in San Diego State 4-0, and Cal State Fullerton 4-3, but have been blown out by No. 30 ranked TCU 4-0 and were outmatched by No. 44 Pepperdine 6-1. In their last match against No. 9 USC, the Anteaters were swept 7-0.</p>\n<p>Starting at number one singles for UC Irvine is Marivick Mamiit who fell to USC’s Brynn Boren 3-6, 2-6. The Anteaters have indeed had a tough schedule, but have dropped matches to teams who they were projected to defeat or who were of lesser rank. If the Gauchos arrive ready to win and get themselves in an early match lead against UC Irvine, then UCSB has a high chance of retrieving the win and the upset on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Another factor contributing to the Gauchos is the change of scoring rules against conference opponents. The NCAA had been working out a trial run of new scoring to make non-conference games shorter. In all of UCSB’s matches up to this point, there has been no complete third set, but rather a tiebreak to determine a winner if the first two sets have been split. This has been received with great disdain by the UCSB players, because instead of a match being determined by skill, it becomes more of a toss-up of who can reach 10 points in the tiebreak first.</p>\n<p>“Irvine will definitely be tough,” senior Kiersten Meehan said. “They are one of the toughest teams in the conference, but it will be great to go back to old scoring. I think we are a very fit team, so having the old scoring back will definitely work in our favor.”</p>\n<p>The match is set to begin this Saturday at 11 a.m. at the UC Irvine tennis courts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54105\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-look-to-turn-season-around-against-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54105\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-look-to-turn-season-around-against-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-look-to-turn-season-around-against-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-look-to-turn-season-around-against-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-look-to-turn-season-around-against-irvine/","id":219,"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete"},"related":[218,217,216],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete","biography":"Not available","articles":[171,175,178,189,192,194,196,208,209,210,211,217,219,305,658,659,662,728,746,749,785,786,1774,1806],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Tries to Rebound, Returns to Play Pacific","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/UCSB.Womens.Tennis.vs_.USF-4-1.26.2014-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/UCSB.Womens.Tennis.vs_.USF-4-1.26.2014-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB faces former conference foe Pacific at home this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Looking for a rebound from last week’s losses to Washington State and the University of Washington, the UCSB women’s tennis team prepares to host Pacific University this Sunday in its second home game of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB (1-5) looks to gain a win against Pacific (2-2) in hopes of avoiding what would be a fourth consecutive loss.

Freshman Kaiulani Boyer had her inaugural start at first singles for the Gauchos last Sunday, but was defeated by Washington’s Grace Ysidora 6-2, 7-6. The only other match where the Gauchos put up a considerable fight was the second singles duel. Junior April Scatliffe, who has been an extensive aid to the Gauchos thus far, faced Washington’s Elianne Douglas-Miron. The entirety of the match was close, but in the end Douglas-Miron outlasted Scatliffe 7-6, 3-6, 10-6.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Washington is among the strongest teams in the Pac-12 and one of the tougher opponents UCSB will face all season. The Gauchos also had the dilemma of traveling overnight from their earlier match against Washington State on Saturday, which is nearly 300 miles from Seattle where University of Washington is located. This Sunday however, the Gauchos will be at home against Pacific, a team similar to the Gauchos in terms of skill level.</p>\n<p>“I think it will be great to play at home,” senior Kiersten Meehan said. “I know it was a tough transition for everyone last weekend to go from here to snowy weather and having to play indoors. Pacific is always a competitive match, so I am sure the home court advantage will be a deciding factor.”</p>\n<p>Pacific travels to UCSB winning two of its last three matches. The Tigers latest match was a shootout victory over New Mexico State 4-3. Starting at number one singles for Pacific is Iveta Masarova who handily defeated NMSU’s Ros-Polly Nguyen 6-3, 6-2. UCSB will definitely have its hands full on Sunday, and pulling off a win will involve the intensified stamina and mental capabilities that the Gauchos have been pushing for all season.</p>\n<p>“We feel very pumped because we lost a close one to Pacific last year with a score of 4-3, so we are definitely ready to get some revenge this weekend,” Scatliffe said. “I think the energy we are going to bring and the comfort with playing at home will be key factors for us. Everyone is going to need to step it up and take care of business on their court.”</p>\n<p>The match is set to begin this Sunday at 10 a.m. at the Recreational Center tennis courts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of February 13, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54012\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-tries-to-rebound-returns-to-play-pacific/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54012\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-tries-to-rebound-returns-to-play-pacific/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-tries-to-rebound-returns-to-play-pacific/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-tries-to-rebound-returns-to-play-pacific/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/ucsb-tries-to-rebound-returns-to-play-pacific/","id":217,"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete"},"related":[216,215,214],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Squander 21-point Lead at Home, Fall to Seattle","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=679%2C405&ssl=1","description":"It was a rough ending for the UCSB women's basketball team as the Gauchos fell to Seattle University in their home opener.

The Redhawks earned their first win of the season against Santa Barbara, so they sit at 1-2 as well.</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior Drew Edelman led Santa Barbara with 16 points and 19 rebounds. Senior forward Chaya Durr added 12 points and eight boards while fellow redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter added 13 and seven boards. Freshman guard Sarah Bates contributed 11 points while freshman guard Danae Miller recorded a team-high four assists.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had a rough night finding the net, shooting 39.4 percent from the field and just 28.6 percent from beyond the arc. Tal Sahar, the redshirt sophomore who played for Seattle two years ago, only played five minutes, going 0-3 with one steal.</p>\n<p>Seattle was led by Alexis Montgomery, a redshirt senior, who ended the game with 20 points and 12 rebounds. Sophomore guard Kamira Sanders contributed a bit of everything for the Redhawks, scoring 21 points to go along with 9 boards, 6 assists and 4 steals.</p>\n<p>On the night, Seattle actually shot better from beyond the arc than overall. Converting on 10-24 threes and 27-65 shots overall, the Redhawks shot 41.7 and 41.5 percent, respectively.</p>\n<p>Both teams appeared evenly matched in the first quarter, with the quarter ending 14-14.</p>\n<p>After a back and forth first quarter, which was hardly impressive for either team, Santa Barbara went on a run in the second to take a 23-18 lead and forced a Seattle timeout with 5:46 remaining.</p>\n<p>Out of the timeout, the Gauchos maintained their momentum. Porter contributed 10 of her 13 points in the second quarter. With the Redhawks shooting only 25 percent from the field in the quarter, the Gauchos were able to end the half with a slight edge at a 36-24 lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB opened the second half with energy and looked to be in control.</p>\n<p>With 5:39 to go in the third, the Gauchos used a Bates three to go up 51-30, leading by their largest margin of the game.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Santa Barbara, it gave up a 15-9 Seattle run to end the quarter. The Redhawks used big scoring from Montgomery and a handful of three-pointers for their 21-point quarter. While Seattle remained down 15 heading into the fourth, Santa Barbara appeared to have gotten too comfortable with its lead.</p>\n<p>In the final quarter, Seattle made a huge comeback, shocking the home crowd.</p>\n<p>Seattle held the Gauchos to an abysmal 5-for-20 shooting and only 1-for-6 performance from beyond the arc in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Freshmen guards Cece Quintino, Bates and Miller each faced heavy pressure from the Seattle defense, led primarily by the pestering defense of McKenzie Williams. Williams seemed to have the young guards’ numbers in the fourth, making it a hard task for Santa Barbara to simply get the ball across half court at times.</p>\n<p>The Redhawks finally got their offense rolling in the fourth, using a big quarter from Kamira Sanders. Sanders had 13 points on 5-for-5 shooting to go with 6 rebounds, 2 assists and a steal in the fourth quarter alone.</p>\n<p>Shooting 62.5 percent from three helped the Redhawks overcome the deficit, making 5-of-8 shots from beyond the arc. Fans watched in disbelief as the Gauchos squandered their 21-point lead and Seattle came storming back. While the Gauchos were held to 11 points in the quarter, Seattle put up 32.</p>\n<p>After a few back and forth possessions of Seattle chipping away at Santa Barbara’s lead, it looked like UCSB had a chance to regain its composure.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos brought the ball up the floor with 2:56 remaining, up 71-70. Santa Barbara got the ball inside to Edelman on a nice feed that gave the forward a clean look, but the 6’4 forward could not convert.</p>\n<p>Frustration seemed to kick in for the Gauchos, as missed shots and an unanswered 7-0 run by Seattle pushed Santa Barbara into desperation mode. The Gauchos ended the game with three possessions each ending in badly-missed three-point shots, and Seattle made enough of its free-throws to close out the game.</p>\n<p>Scoreless in the final 2:56, the Gauchos fell to the Redhawks 77-71.</p>\n<p>Luckily for UCSB, it will have a week break to perhaps solidify its defense and work on running its offense the way Coach Henrickson wants. UCSB will travel to Moraga, CA for the Saint Mary’s Tournament, which will begin this Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79840\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-20/gauchos-squander-21-point-lead-at-home-fall-to-seattle/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79840\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-20/gauchos-squander-21-point-lead-at-home-fall-to-seattle/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-20/gauchos-squander-21-point-lead-at-home-fall-to-seattle/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-20/gauchos-squander-21-point-lead-at-home-fall-to-seattle/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-20/gauchos-squander-21-point-lead-at-home-fall-to-seattle/","id":218,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[217,216,215],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Face No. 2 USC, Fresno State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Margarita-Baliyan_2.9.14_-MensTennis-25.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Margarita-Baliyan_2.9.14_-MensTennis-25.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB travels to face No. 2 USC befoer hosting Fresno State in a pair of weekend matches.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It was a disappointing trip to Hawaii for the UCSB men’s tennis team as the Gauchos lost to Hawaii Pacific on Saturday 6-1 and then saw the rain cancel their first conference match of the season against Hawaii University. This leaves the Gauchos’ record at 2-4. Santa Barbara now looks towards this upcoming weekend with matches away at No. 2 University of Southern California on Friday and at home against Fresno State on Sunday.</p>\n<p>The only positive from this weekend was the play of junior Tobias Galskov. Ranked No. 108 in the country, Galskov won his fourth dual match of the season with a victory over sophomore Jaume Martinez-Vich, No. 6 in Division II, 6-3, 7-5. Other than this lone victory, the Gauchos lost the rest of their matches against the Sea Warriors, the No. 5-ranked team in Division II tennis.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos continued to struggle in their doubles play, losing the doubles point for the fourth match in a row. The new doubles pair made up of freshmen Teague Hamilton and Erik Johnsson barely lost to their opponents, juniors Adriano Locorotondo and Yann Renault, 8-7, while junior Ziad Sultan and senior Sasha Gryaznov lost 8-5 and the pair of Galskov and junior Miles Seemann fell 8-4.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I liked how our new pair of Hamilton and Johnsson played,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “I think they’ve earned another chance this weekend against USC.”</p>\n<p>Going to play USC will be the Gauchos most difficult test of the season thus far. The Trojans are 7-1 this season and will be looking to add to their record to ensure their place in the NCAA Tournament at the end of the season. USC is coming off losing in the championship match of the ITA National Team Indoor Championships to Ohio State, now the No. 1 ranked team in the nation. USC defeated No. 15 Tennessee, No. 7 Baylor and reigning NCAA runners-up No. 4 UCLA in order to make it to the championship match where the team lost 4-1. This result was similar to that of USC’s loss to Ohio State last spring in the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>“We’ve played well against USC in the past,” Davis said. “They are a great team and it’s my job to get our guys excited for the opportunity to take on this top ranked side and to try to get the upset.”</p>\n<p>The Trojans will be led by senior No. 7 Ray Sarmiento and junior No. 16 Yannick Hanfmann. Both players earned ITA All-American honors last year for singles and look to do the same this year. As a doubles pair, they are ranked No. 35 in the nation and will be a big test for Sultan/Gryaznov as the Gauchos top pair.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, the Gauchos will come home to take on Fresno State. The Bulldogs are 2-6 overall and have lost their last four matches, most recently to No. 76 Santa Clara this past Sunday, 4-0. After winning all three doubles matches, Santa Clara won the first three singles matches and the dual match was deemed over. The Bulldogs also had a match against Pacific on Wednesday night and will take on New Mexico at home on Friday before playing the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“We don’t know much about Fresno State,” Davis said. “They have a new coach, almost a completely new lineup, but I think we will have a great match against them.”</p>\n<p>The Bulldogs’ top player is junior Sai Kartik Nakireddi. He will be followed by freshmen John Darmstaedter and Eric Komati and sophomore Nikolas Papic. The Bulldogs have struggled in doubles, as the Gauchos have, losing the doubles point in their last four losses as well. The Gauchos will look to capitalize on this and gain momentum in order to win the rest for the match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos take on USC at 1 p.m. on Friday in Los Angeles and will play Fresno State at home on Sunday at 1 p.m. at the tennis courts behind the Recreational Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of February 20, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Margarita Baliyan of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54103\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-face-no-2-usc-fresno-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54103\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-face-no-2-usc-fresno-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-face-no-2-usc-fresno-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-face-no-2-usc-fresno-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-face-no-2-usc-fresno-state/","id":216,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[215,214,213],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
