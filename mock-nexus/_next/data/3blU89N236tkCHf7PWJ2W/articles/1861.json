Considering the overall magnitude of the team and all the years that rolled by, fans of Philadelphia craved that Vince Lombardi trophy more and more ever since the first inaugural Super Bowl back in 1967.</p>\n<p>Factor in two previous runner-up appearances (third time’s the charm), including a phenomenal 2017-18 season, and then you got the Eagles’ faithful talking about this being their year. Oh, how right they were.</p>\n<p>Before I get into the Super Bowl itself and how ‘pundits’ alike were counting out the Eagles all year long, I’m going to mention a few key moments from both regular and postseason play that stood out that ultimately led up to the completion of the Philadelphia dream as well as football’s greatest underdog tale.</p>\n<p><strong>The Field Goal Heard Around the World</strong></p>\n<p>What a start to the season this was. Carson Wentz had begun to show signs of major second-year progression, the Eagles had seemingly found a No. 1 wide receiver in Alshon Jeffery and that four-headed monster of a defensive line had only just begun its rampage on opposing quarterbacks.</p>\n<p>It was a Week Three divisional matchup at home for the Eagles when the New York Giants came knocking on Philadelphia’s door.</p>\n<p>Thrust early on into desperation mode after conceding the first two matches of the new season, the Giants sought to upset the Eagles in their own backyard and spoil the festivities of what looked to be the start of a promising year.</p>\n<p>It was a back and forth game throughout, but in the final minute of the fourth quarter, the game was tied at 24-24. The Eagles had moved up the field minimally but still had time to get into field goal range before the clock expired.</p>\n<p>On a right side curl route, Wentz found Jeffery for a 27-yard gain who then stepped out of bounds with one second remaining.</p>\n<p>Enter rookie kicker Jake Elliott, who landed the field goal from a franchise record of 61-yards out, earning the Eagles their second win of the season in very memorable fashion.</p>\n<p><strong>A Primetime Performance</strong></p>\n<p>With both teams at a 4-1 overall record, many analysts had the Eagles and Panthers battling for a top-three slot in the weekly power rankings. Luckily, the two teams would go on and face off in a primetime Thursday Night Football matchup.</p>\n<p>This away game would prove to be the hardest meeting for the Eagles this far into the season. With Cam Newton on the rise once more, Philadelphia was the only thing standing in Carolina’s way.</p>\n<p>The match was a hard-fought and close affair as both sides swapped leads several times.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the game came down to stamina as the Eagles’ defensive line completely halted the opposing run game, thus forcing Newton to overthrow and exhaust himself, resulting in a pair of late interceptions that halted all hope for a comeback.</p>\n<p>The Eagles had done it again in the clutch, proving that they were definitely a team to keep an eye on.</p>\n<p><strong>Wentz in a Lifetime</strong></p>\n<p>In the following week, the Eagles would go on to host a divisional Monday Night Football game for the ages against the Redskins. More specifically, Carson Wentz would go on and shred Washington in the air for 268 yards and four touchdowns.</p>\n<p>This standout game for Wentz would prove to be the platform for his potential MVP candidacy.</p>\n<p>Putting on a show all season long, he once again achieved some unbelievable feats by escaping collapsing pockets and making almost impossible throws all across the field.</p>\n<p>Truly, this was the start of something special for the Eagles’ organization and its fans, as talks of a deep playoff run were brewing.</p>\n<p><strong>Star Foles: A New Hope</strong></p>\n<p>Rams versus Eagles, Goff versus Wentz: a great battle in the NFC as well as the NFL Game of the Week at the famous Coliseum.</p>\n<p>At this point in the season, Philadelphia was at the top of the league standings and was just one win away from clinching the NFC East Division title.</p>\n<p>It was perhaps the most thrilling matchup yet — or perhaps I’m just biased because I saw it all go down live in person — as both sides just couldn’t stop scoring.</p>\n<p>Then, tragedy: Wentz goes down with an ACL tear after diving into the end zone in order to hand his team the lead.</p>\n<p>As Philly fans held their breath, they looked to backup quarterback Nick Foles to save the day. He’d go on to do more than just that, as we all know.</p>\n<p>Thus, the start of the Foles era began in the midst of a potentially abrupt end to the season and minute hope for what he could possibly achieve in the playoffs.</p>\n<p><strong>“They’re the Best Defense in the League; You Can’t Win!”</strong></p>\n<p>Thirty-eight total points, that was just how much the Eagles dropped on what pundits proclaimed as, ‘the best defense in the NFL.’</p>\n<p>The Vikings visited Lincoln Financial Field in hopes of earning a one-way ticket to the Super Bowl, which would be held in Minnesota regardless — that is, unless Foles and the Eagles had something to say about it.</p>\n<p>Starting with a pick-six by veteran cornerback Patrick Robinson, the floodgates were opened in Philly as the scores began to rain down on the opposing defense.</p>\n<p>Running backs LeGarrette Blount and Jay Ajayi ground pounded, tight end Zach Ertz caught on third down to move the chains and Foles flung it into the end zone from deep … The Eagles had done it.</p>\n<p>They had finally earned their chance to return to the Super Bowl, this time in hopes of exacting revenge upon a familiar enemy.</p>\n<p><strong>Super Bowl LII: Eagles 41 – Patriots 33</strong></p>\n<p>The previous section’s subheader was a critic’s quote for a reason. I can’t even begin to tell you the number of Eagles nonbelievers that were present in both national coverage and local media.</p>\n<p>You would think after all the counting out going on during the season and through the playoffs that the dialogue would change from “you can’t” to “maybe you can.” Inevitably, the Eagles went on and achieved as the underdogs once more.</p>\n<p>It was Brady, the G.O.A.T., versus Foles, the hope. Early on the Eagles took and maintained the lead.</p>\n<p>Following a pair of field goals on each side, a deep throw from Foles found its way into Jeffery’s control as he made a spectacular catch that resulted into a 34-yard touchdown.</p>\n<p>With a score of 9-3 early in the 2nd quarter, the Patriots would go on to travel all the way down the field until eventually missing on a muffed field goal attempt.</p>\n<p>The Eagles would go on and take advantage of Patriots turnovers on downs and hand the ball to Blount for a 21-yard rushing touchdown and extend their lead to 15-3.</p>\n<p>New England would soon respond after with a made long field goal, interception near the end zone, and a James White rushing touchdown with no extra point after.</p>\n<p>Halftime was on the horizon, but second year head coach Doug Pederson had something special planned for the Patriots on 4th and Goal; the “Philly Special” that is.</p>\n<p>The “Philly Special” play will go down in the Super Bowl history books as one of the best trick plays ever accomplished.</p>\n<p>This formation featured Foles ushering over to the shotgun position as yelled at his offensive line in order to distract New England’s defense.</p>\n<p>The ball was then abruptly snapped to halfback Corey Clement who ran left until he lateral passed possession to tight end Trey Burton.</p>\n<p>All the meanwhile Foles had sneakily walked unmarked into the right side of the goal line, then catching the easy touchdown pass from Burton.</p>\n<p>I’ll be honest, I screamed at the top of my lungs when I saw this entire maneuver get pulled off on the big screen in real-time.</p>\n<p>As the halftime whistle was blown, the Eagles entered the locker room with a lead of 22-12 and were just two full quarters away from the franchise’s biggest victory ever.</p>\n<p>Entering the third, Brady had a point to prove, likely relating to his moniker of ‘the Comeback Kid.’</p>\n<p>He ended the first possession of the new half with a darting touchdown pass to his favorite target in tight end Rob Gronkowski, bringing the score to 19-22. Foles then responded on the following drive with a touchdown pass of his own to Clement and expanded the Eagles’ lead once more to 29-19, but it was still a game that could burst wide open at any second.</p>\n<p>Then, as if the current trend was a surprise to anyone, Brady brought it back to within a score by way of touchdown pass to wide receiver Chris Hogan. The 4th quarter whistle would then bring the game to its most crucial point as time appeared to slow down entirely in this for the most part fast paced game.</p>\n<p>The Eagles started the last quarter of the match with a long field goal kick courtesy of Elliott, Philadelphia lead 32-26.</p>\n<p>On the next drive, Brady knew a touchdown would be enough to earn the Patriots the lead and shift the momentum in his side’s favor.</p>\n<p>Considering this game broke the record for most offensive yards in a Super Bowl back in the 3rd quarter, this possession was no different as Brady had his team travel down the field as he once again delivered a touchdown pass to Gronkowski.</p>\n<p>Down for the first time since the field goal exchange in the first quarter, Foles and the Eagles needed one last feat of skillful endurance as the clock wound down with the score still at 32-33.<br>\nClutch player spoiler, here comes Zach Ertz.</p>\n<p>Following a pair of first-down catches made by Ertz himself, the star tight end went on to catch the game-winning score that put Philadelphia up 38-33 late in the game.</p>\n<p>The two-point conversion failed but that didn’t matter because it was still all hands on deck regardless if the Eagles defense had any chance of stopping Brady and his bunch.</p>\n<p>Then, the greatest defensive play in Eagles history occurred right before everyone’s eyes.</p>\n<p>“Brady gets hit, the ball is out!” yelled play-by-play announcer Kevin Harlan as Philadelphia defensive end Brandon Graham strips possession away from the New England quarterback’s grasp.</p>\n<p>The ball ended up getting recovered by Eagles first-round drafted rookie Derek Barnett and his side was now in prime position to run out the clock and earn their first ever Super Bowl.</p>\n<p>Goosebumps ran rampant on both sides’ fans as each hoped for the best. Ultimately the Patriots would go on to hold the Eagles to only a field goal, but used up all their timeouts in the process.</p>\n<p>With the score at 41-33 and the clock within the final minute of play, the Eagles just needed a single defensive stop on downs.</p>\n<p>Playing deep in their own secondary, the Eagles only allowed Brady to get into a Hail Mary passing range as the whole nation held its breath for the last play of Super Bowl 52.</p>\n<p>They had done it. It was over.</p>\n<p>The Eagles had won.</p>\n<p>The final play resulted in that Hail Mary pass and the obvious target of Gronkowski’s huge frame was covered by six different Eagles cornerbacks.</p>\n<p>As the failed ball fell on the ground, so did all the green confetti.</p>\n<p>It was a night to remember for a new dynasty, and a night to forget for the old dynasty.</p>\n<p>We can all now breathe a sigh of relief Eagles fans; we made it into the circle of champions.</p>\n<p>Hopes were high for this glorious match and hopes will remain high as our team’s future remains bright with the help of both Wentz and Foles, the young and experienced star core on both offense and defense, as well as the coaching and administrative talents involved with the Eagles organization. Now as the offseason approaches and we let this win sink in, all I have to say is one last thing… Go Birds.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Feb. 22</em><em>, 2018, edition

id=\"caption-attachment-92890\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of the stations is to provide hungry students with a quick snack during the middle of their days. </span><em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Promise Scholar Program is comprised of 500 students who are a part of underrepresented and low-income groups and who have an average family income of $25,000, according to Program Director Holly Roose. Students who qualify for the program are promised an estimated $120,000 in financial aid over four years if they remain Cal Grant or Pell Grant eligible. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose said that the goal of the stations is to provide students who are hungry with a quick snack during the middle of their days, with options such as granola bars, trail mix, fig bars and fruit snacks, and to supply menstrual products.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the frustrations that motivated this project was that in order to get into the dining commons and access the [A.S.] Food Bank, you need to have a student ID, and our [Promise Scholar] kids often lose their IDs so $35 is a lot of money to replace it,” Roose said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stations have been placed in 10 locations on campus, including the Transfer Student Center, Opening New Doors to Accelerating Success Student Center, UCSB Student Health, the MultiCultural Center, the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, El Centro, College of Letters and Sciences Advising in Cheadle Hall, the Athletics Department, the Educational Opportunity Program and the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose explained that the new project was funded by the California government, which allocated around $80,000. The grant is designated to be spent by June and will be a contender for renewal if the project succeeds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For students with a heavy academic workload, sitting down for a meal during the day is not always feasible. Fifth-year biochemistry and molecular biology major and Promise Scholar Sami Kaayal said the conveniently placed snacks have helped him stay fueled during busy days. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Having a decent chunk of those snacks throughout the week can help me whether I’m rushing to class and I don’t have time to eat breakfast … or just as supplemental snacks throughout the day between classes,” Kaayal said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the Promise Scholars Program represents low-income students, Roose explained that the healthy snacks and menstrual products are available to all students on campus, regardless of income. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Promise Scholars Program deals with very low-income students, but the middle-class students fall through the cracks on this campus as well,” Roose said. “They don’t get financial aid but they can’t necessarily pay for college either so some of the middle-class students are even needier sometimes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At the end of the day, I just want hungry students to get food and proper sanitary products.”</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aniket Mehrotra</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> contributed reporting. </span></em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article

id=\"caption-attachment-87436\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rabbi Evan Goodman, executive director of the Santa Barbara Hillel, spoke at last year’s divestment meeting against the resolution. </span><em>Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The executive director of the Santa Barbara Hillel, Rabbi Evan Goodman, has organized and led the trip for the past five years. The trip is described on the Hillel </span><a href=\"https://santabarbarahillel.wufoo.com/forms/perspectives-with-sb-hillel-application-2020/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">application</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as an almost free “life-changing trip to explore Israel and the Palestinian Authority.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will bring UCSB undergraduate student leaders together to learn about inter-group and interpersonal relations. Along the way, we will explore Israeli society, Palestinian society, and the conflict in the region,” the application for the trip reads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the application page, the Santa Barbara Hillel, which is located in Isla Vista, says students will, among other things, “[hear] multiple narratives from a wide variety of speakers and guests, including religious, secular, Druze, Christian, Jewish-Israeli, Palestinian, and Muslim voices.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition lays out several reasons why Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) is opposed to the trip, building upon a statement it released </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/UCSBSJP/photos/a.531496596893112/2383080478401372/?type=3&amp;theater\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">last spring</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that called upon student leadership to “refrain from attending the Perspectives Israel Trip.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We oppose this trip on the basis of morally deficient funding sources, normalization of the occupation of Palestine, and its ultimate goal of silencing calls for Palestinian freedom,” the organization wrote in this year’s petition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SJP argues in the petition that any Associated Students (A.S.) senators who attended a Perspectives trip would have a conflict of interest if a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/a-s-senate-votes-against-divestment-through-secret-ballot/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“divestment resolution”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> were to be reintroduced this year. Over the past several years, A.S. senators have introduced various resolutions calling for A.S. and UCSB, among other UC entities, to withdraw investments from companies that profit off of alleged human rights violations by the Israeli government against the Palestinian people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last spring was the sixth time in seven years that a version of the resolution was introduced to the A.S. Senate. The resolution failed last year, making UCSB the only undergraduate campus in the UC system that has not passed a divestment resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Attorney General Tyler Barth, who is responsible for </span><a href=\"https://coc.as.ucsb.edu/position/office-of-the-attorney-general-attorney-general/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">investigating and prosecuting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “any potential violations of ASUCSB Legal Code,” said in an email that conflicts of interest are defined in A.S. Legal Code as “situations of personal financial gain (A1), situations wherein votes are cast to benefit friends and family (A2), and situations where the interests of AS senators’ outside organizational involvements conflict with the interests of ASUCSB (A3).”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said in a follow-up interview that while the Perspectives trips were mostly covered by the Santa Barbara Hillel, they did not count, in his interpretation of Legal Code, as a “financial gain,” since attendees did not actually receive any financial compensation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barth, in addition to a number of current and former elected members of A.S., went on the Perspectives trip this past summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I decided to go on this educational trip, I was seeking to enhance my knowledge of international issues through first-hand experience. If I thought it was a conflict of interest and would inhibit my ability to judge fairly and impartially as Attorney General the following year, I would not have gone,” Barth said in a message when asked if he believed his own attendance on the trip created a conflict of interest in determining if attending the trip created a conflict of interest for senators.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I maintain that, using the definition of conflict of interest in AS Legal Code that governs my position, Perspectives is not a conflict of interest for elected officials who have gone or intend to go on it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition also argues that the application for the trip “implicitly states” that the trip will be unbiased but does not actually provide students with “a diversity of perspectives” because the trip is funded by Maccabee Task Force (MTF); MTF advertises itself on its website as an organization created “to combat the disturbing spread of anti-Semitism on America’s college campuses.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe the BDS movement is at the forefront of this troubling trend. We maintain that BDS is an anti-Semitic movement that crosses the line from legitimate criticism of Israel into the dangerous demonization of Israel and its supporters,” MTF continues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement is “a Palestinian-led movement for freedom, justice and equality,” according to the </span><a href=\"https://bdsmovement.net/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">movement’s website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and “aims to end international support for Israeli violations of international law by forcing companies, institutions and governments to change their policies.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition argues that MTF’s stance “demonstrate[s] [MTF’s] closed mindedness regarding the occupation, given its obvious and vehement opposition to the Palestinian call for</span><a href=\"https://bdsmovement.net/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against Israel (BDS).” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SJP also condemns the fact that Sheldon Adelson — one of the </span><a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/trump-inc-podcast/sheldon-adelson-casino-magnate-trump-macau-and-japan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">biggest funders</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and a “</span><a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/2018/10/22/sheldon-adelson-breaks-spending-record-on-midterm-elections-surpassing-100m/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">conservative megadonor</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” — serves as president of MTF. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Furthermore, the reign of terror that Donald Trump and Republican Congresspeople have exacted on marginalized communities within the United States and across the globe, combined with the continued occupation of Palestine galvanized by far-right political figures in Israel, has been extensively funded by Adelson much like MTF’s Perspectives Trips,” the petition wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition also notes that the Santa Barbara Hillel received $238,739 from MTF in 2016 for “Campus Education and Trip to Israel” — the largest donation to a college campus listed on the </span><a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/474908810/201702979349300200/full\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maccabee Task Force’s 2016 tax returns</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — and an additional $119,807 in </span><a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/474908810/201842699349301204/full\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2017</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There was no donation purpose listed on the 2017 returns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This demonstrates the immense commitment from outside billionaires to engage in “pro-Israel” lobbying on students, specifically at the UCSB campus,” the petition wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goodman, the executive director of Santa Barbara Hillel, said the organization receives funding from people with a wide variety of political views, but that a funder’s political leanings do not affect the kind of programming the center puts on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It happens, that in this case, we have a funder who we’re transparent about. If students ask, we will tell them where the particular funding from portions of this comes from,” Goodman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our organization has a budget that is close to a million dollars; there’s no student who would be happy with the politics of every single one of those donors,” he added. “We have conservative students as well, who might not be happy with some of our progressive donors’ political leanings. But that doesn’t mean that we don’t use those funds to help put on Shabbat dinners on Friday night.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goodman also said he is personally responsible for putting together the itinerary for the Perspectives trip. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That doesn’t mean that my own personal politics need to align with a lead donor on this project to make it a successful project,” Goodman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Goodman said Hillel does not claim that the trip will be unbiased. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I make it very clear, it’s not unbiased. We’re gonna show them lots of biases, we’re gonna show them a wide variety of different perspectives, and they’re not gonna agree with all of them,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The idea that college students would come to college in order to advocate boycotts, and then advocate boycotts of things that could help you to learn more about the situation at hand or meet other people is patently absurd,” Goodman added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to opposing the trip due to its funding sources, SJP wrote in the petition that they are calling for a boycott of the trip because they believed the trip contributes to the “normalization of the occupation of Palestine, and its ultimate goal of silencing calls for Palestinian freedom.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SJP representatives Dylan Kupsh and Ivana Cruz said in an interview that they felt the need to circulate this petition because they believed “outside lobbyists” should not be influencing campus politics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope people understand the real gravity at stake at UCSB and how much people are lobbying,” Kupsh said. “I would be outraged as a student to know that an outside person is influencing student politics more than students themselves or student orgs.”  </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Vista. </span><em>Devin Ralston / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new </span><a href=\"https://www.conferences.ucsb.edu/intern-housing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">initiative</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allows students from any college or university with a summer job or internship in the Santa Barbara area to stay in UCSB-owned housing for the summer. The initiative was created in response to similar programs at other UC schools, such as UC Los Angeles and UC Berkeley, according to Whitney Morris, director of Conference and Hospitality Services at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We noticed that [the program] was very successful [at other UC schools],” Morris said, “and that it was definitely fitting a need for students in the summer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because subletting apartments or houses over the summer in the Santa Barbara area can be expensive for students, Morris said she and her colleagues wanted to create an affordable alternative for college students interning in the area, regardless of whether or not they are enrolled at UCSB. The San Joaquin Villages were </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/freshman-summer-start-program-fssp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">previously used</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for summer camps and programs, such as for parents staying overnight for their child’s freshman orientation, and will continue to house students and parents for summer programs alongside the new intern housing.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students in the summer Intern Housing program would live in the apartments for a 30-day minimum at a cost of $35 per night, or $1,050 a month, for a double room or $55 per night, or $1,650 a month, for a single room, according to the program’s website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, the summer Intern Housing program has one applicants and has 107 bed spaces to fill, Morris said. Participants must be at least 18 years old and provide proof of enrollment in a college or university. The program is also open to UCSB students working on campus during the summer. The application for the program opened on Feb. 3 and will close at 12 p.m. on June 1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The San Joaquin Villages, </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/hdae-building-development\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">built in 2016</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, are </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/residences/san-joaquin-villages\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s newest housing complex</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The San Joaquin Villages were built as a part of the university’s </span><a href=\"https://www.facilities.ucsb.edu/departments/campus-planning-design/2010-long-range-development-plan-lrdp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long Range Development Plan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an initiative to increase UCSB’s enrollment by one percent each year until 2025. The plan seeks to accommodate a total of 5,000 additional students and provide housing for all of them. The San Joaquin Villages feature 165 apartments and can house approximately 1,000 residents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The complex was chosen for the program because of its amenities, which include a pool and volleyball courts, and its short distance to the dining options available in Isla Vista and Goleta, Morris said. She added that the apartment style of the housing would also be “great in terms of promoting communities.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 20, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Correction [2/20/2020, 7:45 p.m.]: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the San Joaquin Villages were previously used to house parents and their children for summer programs.
