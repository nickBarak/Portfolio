You know what I’ve learned over the last few weeks? It’s hard to want be in shape, too.</p>\n<p>Let’s be honest here. My training regimen is more of a schedule of games that involve me moving around at slightly above-average speeds. This worries me, because if I can’t even get myself up to play soccer at 10 a.m. twice a week — I haven’t gone in three classes — how am I going to keep active when my 9 to 5 prevents my afternoon tanning sessions? I don’t think most people have free Division I-level coaches at their disposal, do they?</p>\n<p>I’m a champion at following directions. If someone tells me what to do and how to do it, I can handle it. Still, I’m never the one pushing myself to do work. From these classes, I don’t just want to learn how to play tennis or soccer or volleyball, I want to learn how to employ the one concept that those college coaches know better than anyone else: motivation.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It’s not that simple, though. Sometimes I worry motivation isn’t something that can be taught, but is one of those things one either has or doesn’t have. Or maybe it’s like a muscle and you have to work it out until it gets strong. I maintain hope that it’s the latter, but that voice in my head isn’t very loud yet, and I think I know a few of the reasons why.</p>\n<p>The first one is easy: drugs and alcohol. Weed has a tricky habit of taking your brain the fuck over. If I’m not out on the playing field, there’s a good chance I’m in the living room taking bong rips. Combined with the standard weekend drinking binge, they create life’s mute button for that voice in my head that keeps my shit together. And when my shit isn’t together, exercise is impossible. Hell, even when my shit is together it’s a bitch to get out there. Luckily for me, I think (read: hope to God) that the ganj intake will take a slight dip when I graduate this year.</p>\n<p>Another is vanity. Let’s face it, I look good. Okay, maybe not “good” with italics, but good enough. I tell people that I’m exercising to get back in shape for my own personal well-being, and that’s true. But a big part of it is that I strive to be attractive. Since I’m naturally lanky without effort, I really don’t need to be exercising all the time to maintain my “figure,” so to speak. Until the D-I coach in my head gets a solid hold on me, if I don’t absolutely need to be doing something that’s hard, then I’m not going to be doing it. I would love to say my vanity will go away with the other college-y stuff, but that would probably turn out to be a lie.</p>\n<p>A third explanation is that the word “motivated” is simply not part of my personality. This one scares me the most, because that shit goes into mental well-being or something. Let’s not go down that path just yet. In terms of exercise, a lack of motivation means a destiny of dwindling health. My dad — who’s a good way to predict my future for better or worse — was a pretty chubby fellow a few years back. Jolly, even. Then, after his “Zen Awakening” or some bullshit, he turned into an avid road cyclist. He could almost definitely kick my ass. His story provides me some amount of comfort. All I have to do is rely on having an epiphany. Easy.</p>\n<p>I realize that narrowing down the reasons for my lack of motivation is a job for a trained psychologist and not for an unmotivated college student. But I think I’ve tapped into something here, and it’s worthwhile to actually sit down and think about the reasons for any kind of self-improvement you’re aiming for. Look closely at everything you can think of and, honestly, be honest.</p>\n<p>Despite missing an ESS class here and there, I am confident that I’ve already achieved some of my goals. I’ve looked at where I was and where I wanted to be, and started moving in that direction. I’m still young, and, like Neo in The Matrix (editor’s note: first, but not last reference to those movies in this column), believe strongly in free will. The inner-voice thing is hard, but right now my goal is to use the Kathy Gregories of this world as an example, and do all I can to turn the voice into my own personal Legend of the Dome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33324\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-14/train-sports-editor-week/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33324\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-14/train-sports-editor-week/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-14/train-sports-editor-week/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-14/train-sports-editor-week/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-14/train-sports-editor-week/","id":2147,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[2146,2145,2144],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard","biography":"Not available","articles":[166,271,297,429,431,451,890,891,921,1297,1701,1702,1704,1705,1706,1708,1709,1710,1712,1714,1715,1716,1717,1720,1722,1723,1725,1726,1727,1728,1729,1730,1732,1733,1739,1740,1741,1744,1753,1755,1756,1760,2147,2150,2163,2807,2898,2905,2915,2918,2998,3172,4535,4548,5495],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"The NBA Trade Deadline: As Foggy as Ever","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"One day after the Knicks traded half of their active roster for Carmelo Anthony, the Nets swooped in and nabbed Deron Williams from the suddenly doomed Utah Jazz.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>One day after the Knicks traded half of their active roster for Carmelo Anthony, the Nets swooped in and nabbed Deron Williams from the suddenly doomed Utah Jazz.</p>\n<p>Truth be told, the New Jersey picture is still unclear. Even if the team just obtained the second-best point guard in the league, its roster is still stocked with the likes of Jordan Farmar and Travis Outlaw. Brook Lopez, its nominal second star, has regressed to small forward-like rebounding numbers and shooting percentage. To say that his progression has disappointed would be akin to calling the Egyptian revolution tumultuous. Although Lopez’s PER hovers around 20, all the speculation about his rise to second-best center in the league was overblown.</p>\n<p>Still, Williams could do much to re-energize the Nets, especially if they decide to give newly-acquired Brandan Wright a shot to prove that leaving him to rot on the Golden State bench was one of Head Coach Don Nelson’s many mistakes. The NBA is all about finding your star, and it would appear that the Nets have upstaged their big brother in the Big Apple in that regard.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I actually kind of love this trade for the Jazz. Although they traded their best player — one who wholly embraced the Utah Jazz experience — for a rookie and for Devin Harris, they also made out with two potentially high draft picks. Look — the Nets aren’t doing anything this year, and Williams’ continued presence in either New Jersey or Utah is far from guaranteed, so it makes sense that the Jazz would try to extract some value  for him while they still had the opportunity. My only question: Why wait until after Utah Jazz Head Coach Jerry Sloan retires to deal their marquee attraction?</p>\n<p>So the Jazz get a promising and hopefully tough, young big in the bargain while securing a lottery pick and a talented but inconsistent scorer in Harris. For the Jazz, Derrick Favors is the key to this deal.</p>\n<p>To succeed in the NBA, you either need a star or five guys so attuned to each other that only a championship and Larry Brown could derail them. If — and this is a massive “if,” — Favors develops to give the Jazz a tougher, more defensively competent counterpart to Big Al and Paul Millsap inside, then they come out of this trade ahead. If Favors flames out, which is not out of the question, then only a draft miracle could save this deal for the Jazz. And I’m not talking about Jimmer Fredette.</p>\n<p>As for the Knicks, they sure look like assholes after this, don’t they? James Dolan got to crow for about 12 hours before having the rug rudely yanked from under him by the Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov. Combined with the fact that Donnie Walsh seems to be on his way out, to be replaced by Isiah Thomas, New Yorkers have to be feeling little better than suicidal. Reports seem to indicate that Thomas, still a Dolan favorite, engineered the trade that sent three starters, a first rounder and Eddy Curry’s donut addiction to the Nuggets. In retrospect, this makes perfect sense. Why else would the Knicks start bidding wildly against themselves? The only threat to Melo’s inevitable move east was his assertion that he would consider signing an extension.</p>\n<p>I really hope we get Isiah back so he can do ridiculous things like offer Greg Oden a maximum contract or flip Chauncey Billups to the Lakers for Ron Artest and Luke Walton. Please, NBA god, please. On the basketball side of things, I’m sure Carmelo will help a little, but is anyone sure that Billups can run anymore? The tandem of Melo and Amar’e Stoudemire sounds really nice but Knicks Head Coach Mike D’Antoni predicates his system on great, speedy point guard play. Billups may be a monument to efficient scoring — not joking, learn what true shooting percentage is and then worship at the altar that is Mr. Big Shot — but he’s not known for his ability to lead a fast break.</p>\n<p>The Nuggets appear to have made out like bandits. With their star player all but guaranteed to leave and demanding to be traded to one team and one team only, they somehow extracted two-and-a-half useful players and a first rounder. Although duping the Knicks’ James Dolan isn’t something one should be proud of — I’ve seen babies hold onto candy better than he negotiates — Nuggets general manager Masai Ujiri deserves a ton of credit for turning a pile of shit into, well, anything. The Nuggets brought him in because of his experience with Chris Bosh fleeing Toronto, and the first African-born NBA general manager did not disappoint in his rookie season. The big question now is whether the team feels that Felton Raymond Felton should stick around or be shipped off for more assets while Ty Lawson takes the reins that rightfully belong to him.</p>\n<p>The Nuggets even added a legit three-point threat in Danilo Gallinari, bumping Al Harrington out of the sixth-man spot that he has been begging someone else to take all season. They’re still stuck under Harrington’s onerous contract, and would probably like to start moving some other flotsam around before the deadline, but their rebuilding effort may not be as painful as many predicted.</p>\n<p>Four teams headed in four very different directions. The Knicks and Nets get better short term, but Prokhorov shows why he made billions in the former USSR — I refuse to give Billy King any credit for this deal — and Dolan exemplifies the dangers of nepotism. While the Jazz and Nuggets may feel a little sting for now, this hurts you much more than it hurts them.</p>\n<p>Neither team is as screwed as Toronto or Cleveland over the next few seasons.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33951\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/nba-trade-deadline-foggy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33951\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/nba-trade-deadline-foggy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/nba-trade-deadline-foggy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/nba-trade-deadline-foggy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-23/nba-trade-deadline-foggy/","id":2145,"author":{"id":94,"name":"Artsweek Editor"},"related":[2144,2143,2142],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"CalFresh Team Announces Changes in SNAP Benefits Caused By Gov.

An <a href=\"https://www.sasa-ca.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/asks-amended.pdf\">updated version of the Asks</a> was then posted to SASA’s website on Feb. 4.</p>\n<p>The first of the Asks requests the Campus, Advocacy, Resources and Education office (C.A.R.E.), Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.), the UC Police Department and the Women’s Center, among others, to be required to attend an open town hall at the beginning of each quarter “for students to voice their questions and concerns.”</p>\n<p>The updated version of the Asks says that the timing of the town hall must be confirmed with SASA at least three weeks in advance, “along with any administrative reports that will be discussed at the Town Hall.”</p>\n<p>This first Ask has already begun implementation – there was a town hall on Nov. 7, and the next town hall is set for Feb. 25, according to Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) director Emily Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>“I think the last town hall went well, I’m happy that we left the town hall with written-down agreements that we all talked about and what each individual in that room is responsible for,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>“Those type of conversations with administration then kind of morphed these [updated] Asks.”</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford added that SASA has spoken to multiple members of UCSB administration in order to begin implementing the rest of the Asks, including Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn, UCSB Title IX Officer Ariana Alvarez, C.A.R.E. director Briana Conway and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead, among others.</p>\n<p>The second Ask says that UCSB must provide SASA with “five thousand dollars annually and by the start of the fiscal year— beginning in 2019— in order to organize a campus-wide campaign regarding affirmative consent.”</p>\n<p>The original list of Asks did not specify the amount needed to fund the campaign.</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford said SASA hasn’t spoken to administration about this Ask yet.</p>\n<p>“I assume Margaret would be the best person to speak to about this,” Montalvo-Telford said. “I believe it’s absolutely necessary that we receive this amount of funds.”</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford clarified that SASA does not believe that these funds should be coming from student fees, and instead the funds should be coming from “the university itself.”</p>\n<p>The third Ask says that the UCSB Title IX office “must provide an annual Public Accountability Report as modeled by the UCLA Title IX office.”</p>\n<p>The updated list of Asks adds that the UCSB Title IX office “must redesign their website to make the information more accessible to students, faculty, and staff.”</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford said that there seems to be some pushback from administration in regards to updating UCSB’s Public Accountability Report so it models UCLA’s, but she is confident that SASA can “work something out” with the administration.</p>\n<p>UCSB administration has yet to agree to make amendments to its current Public Accountability Report.</p>\n<p>“We definitely need to have more conversations about what this Public Accountability Report would look like for our campus,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>UCLA’s Public Accountability Report provides “anonymized descriptive statistics about complaints, investigations, and sanctions that have been meted out in the past,” according to UCLA’s Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion website page.</p>\n<p>“The difference between our campus and the UCLA campus, to my knowledge, is that the UCLA Title IX office and the UCLA Discrimination Prevention office work together to produce this report, versus here, there seems to be a greater distinction between [those two entities] when they’re producing these numbers,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>“The Public Accountability report provided by the UCLA office is so much more thorough, has more information, and it’s just easier to read, it’s easier to understand, easier to follow,” she added. “While it is about the content, it’s also about how easy that content is to be absorbed.”</p>\n<p>The Title IX office has said that they made edits to the website in order to increase accessibility, according to Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>The fourth Ask was not on the original list of Asks – it says that UCSB “must make C.A.R.E.’s Standard of Excellence Training mandatory for OSL organizations and sports teams/clubs.”</p>\n<p>The fifth Ask is new as well, adding that the C.A.R.E office “must provide online access to their Standard of Excellence Training modules regarding healthy relationships and sexual violence and sexual harassment prevention.”</p>\n<p>In order to address both of these Asks, SASA has created subcommittees that consist of Alvarez, Conway, Associate Dean of Students Kim Equinoa, and Director of the Office of Student Life Miles Ashlock.</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford said that the subcommittees are “working together to try to figure out the most realistic and effective way to implement [the Asks].”</p>\n<p>Currently, the fraternities and sororities are the only organizations required to undergo the Standard of Excellence Training. However, Montalvo-Telford wants that to expand that. She said she believes that the fourth Ask is feasible.</p>\n<p>“We’re not suggesting that the same methods be used to implement the Standard of Excellence Training that is provided by C.A.R.E., what we’re suggesting is that there is a way to make this training mandatory for different groups on campus.”</p>\n<p>The first subcommittee meeting is this week, according to Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>The final updated Ask states that UCSB must “provide online access to the Gaucho FYI content.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, SASA “must be provided an opportunity to contribute to and review Gaucho FYI material upon any decisions to alter any content.”</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford said that this final updated Ask is “in its route to being met.”</p>\n<p>SASA has spoken to Equinoa about creating an “online, accessible format of Gaucho FYI” and that Equinoa confirmed that it was possible, according to Montalvo-Telford. Montalvo-Telford believes it can be implemented in time for next year’s Gaucho FYI content.</p>\n<p>SASA also plans to work with administration to provide next year’s Gaucho FYI presentation.</p>\n<p>“To my understanding, what Kim has agreed to right now is allowing us to review the content, give any suggestions we might have,” Montalvo-Telford said. “It has not been said specifically that we have voting power [on the content] but that could be the product of a further conversation.”</p>\n<p>Overall, Montalvo-Telford is satisfied with the progress that has been made regarding the Asks, and she believes that the administration has been very upfront and realistic with SASA.</p>\n<p>“It’s always going to be hard when you’re working with so many different offices trying to figure out the correct solution, but we have been able come together in a room, spit out ideas, and work with each other.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the Feb. 20, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p>\n<p><em>Simren Verma is the university news editor of the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or simren@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.
