Golden State has won by an average of 12.3 points in all three meetings of this season.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, the Warriors have had an insane season breaking almost every record out there. Earning the best start in NBA history with their 24-0 hot streak, longest home winning streak of 54 wins, no back-to-back losses in the entire season, most wins on the road with a 34-7 road record, never lost to the same team twice, and to top it off most single-season wins (73) in NBA history breaking the 1995-1996 Chicago Bulls’ record!</p>\n<p>If the Rockets want a shot at taking the Warriors down they will have to do more than simply rely on James Harden. Even though he is averaging 29 points per game and is shooting at 40 percent from the three point range, his productivity will be highly limited with Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala taking turns guarding him.</p>\n<p>Another player bound to be shut down is Dwight Howard with Draymond Green and Andrew Bogut in the post. This would force the Rockets to shoot from the outside, which is exactly what the Warriors would want since Houston ranks 19th in the three-point shooting percentage. Meanwhile, the Warriors lead the category with a 42 three-point shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>Houston will really have to step up their defense to even stay alive in the next couple of games, especially when their biggest threat is the reigning league MVP himself, Steph Curry. After hitting his 402nd three-pointer on Wednesday night, the 6’3 point guard broke his own record from last year by 116 more. With a 45 three-point shooting percentage it is in the Rockets best interest to find a way to knock him of his game early in the match.</p>\n<p>The Warriors are riding on a high after an impeccable season with no signs of being stopped anytime soon, especially not by the Rockets. My predictions is an easy sweep for Golden State.</p>\n<p><strong>San Antonio Spurs (2) vs. Memphis Grizzlies (2) – Duncan MacPhee</strong></p>\n<p>The Memphis Grizzlies will travel to the AT&amp;T Center in San Antonio, Texas this Sunday, April 17 to take on the San Antonio Spurs in the first game of their first round 2-7 matchup.</p>\n<p>According to oddsshark.com, the Memphis Grizzlies are the underdogs at +9500 to win this best-of-7 series (the Spurs odds are not yet available). What might be perceived by some as a lack of respect for the Grizzlies here is partly due to the fact that the Spurs have been by far the second best team in the NBA, let alone the Western conference.</p>\n<p>With an NBA record-tying 40 wins at home this year, the Spurs have been absolutely unstoppable on their home floor. This doesn’t bode well for any team that matches up with them in the first two rounds, where the team holds home-court advantage.</p>\n<p>San Antonio ended the season with an extremely impressive 67-15 record, and yet they weren’t talked about much at all just because of the absolute dominance of the league by the 73-9 number one seed Warriors. The Spurs might almost prefer flying under the record here though, as they begin their quiet quest for the 2016 Larry O’Brien trophy.</p>\n<p>For their part, the Grizzlies do not figure to be much of a problem for this stacked Spurs lineup. Memphis lost 10 of their last 11 regular season games, and have struggled with injuries and roster turmoil all year long. They have started 28 different players this season, five more than the previous record number of starters for a playoff-bound team.</p>\n<p>The Grizz have lost their two top scorers, Marc Gasol (broken foot) and Mike Conley (Achilles tendinitis), to injury for the entirety of this postseason. As a result, Memphis fans have been forced to watch the often-cringeworthy Tony Allen and Matt Barnes show for the tail end of this regular season. And now they’ll have to sit through the same thing against the second best team in the league.</p>\n<p>A much healthier San Antonio will look to utilize younger stars Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge this postseason while also relying on the veteran presence of the always-productive Big 3 of Tony Parker, Tim Duncan, and Manu Ginobili.</p>\n<p>Luckily for Grizz faithful, the ugliness of this series won’t last longer than the minimum number of games. Spurs in four.</p>\n<p><strong>Oklahoma City Thunder (3) vs. Dallas Mavericks (6) – Elliot Thornton </strong></p>\n<p>The 2015-2016 NBA regular season has undoubtedly been one for the ages. As we say goodbye to a Laker legend in the Black Mamba and reflect on a 73-9 finish by the Golden State Warriors, a new chapter of intensified basketball arises in the 2016 NBA Playoffs. Let’s start with a scope in the Western Conference between the third seed Oklahoma City Thunder and fifth seed Dallas Mavericks.</p>\n<p>Heading into postseason with an overall record of 55-27, the high-powered duo of Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook will be key for the North West Division champions. Dallas players such as Justin Anderson, Charlie Villenueva, and Wesley Matthews will have a tough task limiting the stretch-four Durant, but the majority of its problems will be centered around the triple-double machine in Westbrook.</p>\n<p>In discussion for this year’s MVP, the five-time All-Star has 18 triple-doubles this season, accompanying NBA legends Magic Johnson and Wilt Chamberlain to record 18 or more in the past 50 years. The Thunder are currently ranked second in the league in terms of offensive efficiency, averaging 110.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>Despite two of the NBA’s most elite players, a savvy college coach in Billy Donovan, and a hardnosed frontcourt in Serge Ibaka, Enes Kanter, and Steven Adams the Dallas Mavericks have one secret ingredient which the Thunder lack: experience.</p>\n<p>In his eighth season with the Mavericks and 115 NBA playoff wins under his belt, it is safe to say that Head Coach Rick Carlisle has been in this position plenty of times. Posting its fourth straight season with 42 wins or more, the Mavs will try and utilize this veteran experience to propel them in their first round playoff series. Similar to previous seasons, longtime shooter and Dallas captain Dirk Nowitzki will carry the load for his team.</p>\n<p>Leading the team in scoring for the year at 18.3 points per game, the German native heads into his 14<sup>th</sup> official postseason with an average of 25.4 points per game. While the power forward’s resume does not equally match the 20-year vet Bryant on paper, he will likely try to parallel the Laker legend’s ability to perform under pressure.</p>\n<p>The Thunder hold a 4-0 record over the Mavericks this season. While OKC does have the upper edge with Durant and Westbrook at its side, expect a tight series throughout as three of the regular season games have been decided by four or less points.</p>\n<p><strong>(4) Los Angeles Clippers vs. Portland Trailblazers (5) – Jorge Mercado </strong></p>\n<p>Can the Clips finally get over the hump and get out of the second round? Will Damian Lillard have to average 40 points a game just to help his team win this series? Those are the big questions marking this great first round match-up between the LA Clippers and the Portland Trailblazers.</p>\n<p>These two teams are no strangers as the Clippers beat them three out of four games during their season series this year. In those three wins, LA won by an average of 9.3 points per game with the last win coming courtesy of a game winning three by shooting guard J.J Redick.</p>\n<p>While this match-up has drawn much intrigue it’s not a stretch to say that the Clippers should win this series. They definitely have the better roster led by All-star PG Chris Paul who was fourth in the NBA in assists per game (10) and second in steals (2.02).</p>\n<p>Other key players include great players such as Deandre Jordan who leads the league in field goal percentage (.702) and is second in rebounding with 13.8 per game. Redick is also a key player as he leads the league in three-point field goal percentage with a great 47 percent.</p>\n<p>However, just because the Clippers have the better roster doesn’t mean Portland is just going to give them the series. Portland has Lillard who is one of the best perimeter scorers in the NBA, and as he is helped by the possible most improved player in the league CJ McCollum.</p>\n<p>This season, Lillard averages 25 points per game on 42 percent shooting from the field and 38 percent from three-point range, while McCollum scores 21 a night with 45 percent from the field and 42 percent from deep. There’s no way these two will just let there team lose that easy.</p>\n<p>The final storyline—and quite possibly the biggest—is if Blake Griffin can bounce back or not. In the five games since his return to the Clips he has averaged 10 points, seven rebounds, and four assists. Last year in the playoffs he averaged 25.5 points, 12.7 rebounds, and 6.1 assists per game. It will be interesting to see if that guy can come back.</p>\n<p>Overall this series will be a lot of fun and definitely one you should not miss. However, i do believe the series to be a short one as I predict the Clippers win in five games.</p>\n<p>The first game tips off at Staples Center Sunday, April 17 at 7:30 PST. The game will be televised on TNT and Prime Ticket.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

on UCSB’s campus. </span><em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Academic Researchers United (ARU) obtained signatures from over 2,200 members across the UC campuses for the petition, which were submitted to each UC campus’s respective chancellors’ offices two weeks ago. </span></p>\n<p>“Many [academic researchers (ARs)] are former [postdoctorates] who lost the benefits of having a union when they transferred to an AR position,” McGreal said in an email.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ARs like McGreal </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mentor students and colleagues and run labs daily on UCSB’s campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Neal Sweeney, vice president of UAW Local 5810, explained while academic researchers do much of the same work they did as postdoctorates, they lose the protection of UAW once they transition to titles such as project scientists, specialists, professional researchers and coordinators of public programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Sweeney, ARU formed in order to extend the union benefits postdoctorates were awarded to academic researchers after they transition job titles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These new titles were not part of the union. All the gains we had won in our contract for [postdoctorates] like higher salaries, a very good benefits plan, paid parental leave, protections against sexual [harassment] and discrimination, job security </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we lost all of these in the transition,” Sweeney said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When forming a union, ARU obtained the signatures needed for a super majority and submitted them to the state labor board in September 2018. After some initial delays, bargaining officially began in May 2019 and has been going on ever since, Sweeney said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re calling on UC to work quickly to bargain a fair contract that will ensure sustainable research careers and a more equitable, inclusive workplace,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond job security and improved pay, ARs are bargaining for protections against harassment and discrimination in the workplace, along with gender equity and inclusion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Especially in STEM fields, which most researchers are in, there’s a gender gap,” Sweeney explained. “Having these kinds of protections, like parental leave for example, has been shown to increase retention of women because women aren’t forced to choose between their career and having a family.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While delaying the contract “might seem to benefit the university,” Sweeney believes that improving the conditions for ARs at the UCs will ultimately benefit the UC more in the long run. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a connection between having better working conditions and doing better work,” he said. “When people feel more secure in their jobs, when they feel like there’s protections from [harassment] and discrimination, when they’re paid at a fair level, they can do better research.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elisa Smith, media relations representative in the UC Office of the President, said the office is “working hard to negotiate a fair agreement with the academic researchers as quickly as possible.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since this is a brand new contract, it takes some time to reach agreement as we do not have a prior bargaining agreement to work from, and considerable thought and discussion are required in chartering new territory with unique issues,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Sept. 26, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Kundu wrote a scathing response, and, not knowing what to do with his paper, began sending it to various professors at several American universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To his surprise, some professors got back to him and liked what he had written. At the end of a reply, one professor even invited Kundu to apply for graduate school and study under him in the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That professor was Mattison Mines, who taught anthropology at UCSB from 1970 to 2005. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I pinched myself,” Kundu said, recalling the invitation from Mines. “He is my guru.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Kundu arrived in Santa Barbara for graduate school in 1982, he was primarily interested in the modernization of agriculture, population studies and the Green Revolution in India.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until Kundu was fully immersed in the environmental studies circles at UCSB that he began to see the darker sides of what he was studying — how human behavior and modern agriculture were negatively affecting the environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Mankind’s] connection to environmental degradation … I had no idea until I came here. At the time, that conversation was not happening in India. Everyone was still thinking of how good the Green Revolution was, thinking they had found the solution,” Kundu said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the late 1980s, nearing the completion of his Ph.D., Kundu applied for a lecturer position in the environmental studies department and was subsequently accepted. However, he realized that he hadn’t quite considered the dilemma of whether to return to India or stay in the United States. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had no interest in leaving India permanently. My parents were there, my in-laws, my wife. But I couldn’t leave Santa Barbara either. I fell in love. It is this lifelong love with this campus, its students, its faculty members.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To resolve his problem, Kundu worked out a deal with the department to teach only a couple quarters a year, eventually transitioning to only teaching in the summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu’s first official quarter teaching at UCSB was the winter of 1988. He hasn’t stopped since. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This summer marks his 32nd consecutive year of returning to Santa Barbara from India to teach both environmental studies and anthropology classes including Environmental Studies 132: Human Behavior and Global Environment and Anthropology 148: Ecological Anthropology.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu’s interest in anthropology and the environment began in ninth grade after he attended a village boarding school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There, I came to know the villagers, the farmers. I was born in a city and I had never seen a paddy field before,” Kundu said. “I noticed that these families had a different culture, and I became interested in their lives, the farmers’ lives. It made a deep impact on me.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu was one of the early scholars to approach environmental studies from an anthropological perspective, looking at how the development of human societies and cultures is affecting the environment today. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu wants students to understand that “our own consumption is at the root of the environmental crisis,” noting that during a flight from Japan to the U.S., he received a bottle of water from the Swiss Alps. He lamented the use of resources required to bring the water from Switzerland to Japan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What is the purpose? Was there water scarcity in Japan? I did some research, and no, there’s no water scarcity. The airline wanted to show that they cared about us or something like that. Yet what is the impact? Unless we understand this, we will not be able to change it. Technology is only part of the solution. We need a behavioral solution as well. A change in perspective. That is my key message for students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year biological anthropology major Ana Perez, who is currently taking Anthropology 148: Ecological Anthropology with Kundu, said she appreciates the substance and methodology of Professor Kundu’s teaching.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “When he talked about being one of the first people to actually consider putting environmental studies and anthropology together… I didn’t even think of putting those two together. I hope that more people taking his classes decide to pursue environmental anthropology,” Perez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s awesome that he travels the world for this, and I wish more people had the opportunity to take his courses.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Kundu is grateful for his unique career, it is not without downsides. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you have two homes, you are always homesick,” Kundu said. While in Santa Barbara, it is hard not to miss his wife and family in India. However, he said that friends like Debjani Bhattacharya, a financial analyst at UCSB’s Earth Research Institute, help with that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Really, wherever you go outside of India, there will be an Indian diaspora. We met here 17 years ago through a group of friends,” Bhattacharya said. It just so happened that the two were born and raised in the same state in India, West Bengal, and attended the same university for their undergraduate studies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we go back to India, we visit each other’s families, and we have become family friends.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two friends, along with other colleagues, like to get together to cook traditional Indian meals and take walks on Del Playa Drive. Once, during an evening Del Playa walk, some students approached their group and asked Kundu if he was the chancellor of UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without skipping a beat, Kundu replied, “Not yet.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for what the future holds for Kundu, he welcomes more of the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Teaching is my religion.

law – several times over.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other four other lawsuits filed against the department, </span><a

All of these lawsuits also allege violations of the Whistleblower Act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stern’s complaint stems from the alleged ignoring of several reported cases of misconduct that began in late 2015, and is mainly centered around five other officers: former Officer Josh Rothermel, former Officer Jeff Savaglio, former Officer Ryan Smith, Officer David Millard and Officer Amanda Siegel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the lawsuit, Stern says he raised concerns about two fellow officers – Rothermel and Savaglio, who are also mentioned in the other lawsuits – in late 2015, alleging they were “causing safety risks” by not responding to requests for backup, turning off radios and not answering phone calls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After speaking with the two about his concerns, Stern alleges he was approached by Smith, who told him that Stern’s concerns about Rothermel and Savaglio were “not valid” and threatened to write him up for “speaking with an officer under Smith’s command.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This would mark the first of several interactions with Smith regarding officer misconduct; beginning June 2016, Stern alleges Smith gave Rothermel, Savaglio and Siegel preferential treatment. Additionally, as detailed in other suits, Siegel was alleged to be having an extramarital affair with Smith. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stern said that any attempt to address concerns with the three’s behavior – Rothermel and Savaglio’s alleged safety risks and Siegel’s capabilities as an officer – was met with threats from Smith to write Stern up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Less than a year later, in February 2017, Stern alleges he was accused by outside investigators looking into the department of knowing about Rothermel and Savaglio’s “improper conduct,” but failing “to notify a proper supervisor.” He then informed investigators that he had reported the two officers’ conduct to Smith and that Smith had allegedly threatened him in response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the following months, Stern says he was demoted from his position as corporal “without any explanation,” was not chosen for another qualified position and was excluded from receiving an award for his actions during the </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2017/02/01/milo-yiannopoulos-event-canceled-violent-protests-erupt-uc-berkeley/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley riots</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and during the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-15/santa-barbara-community-mourns-lives-lost-in-montecito-mudslides/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Montecito mudslides</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. According to court documents, Stern believes this was because he told investigators about Smith’s alleged misconduct. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from complaints about Smith, Stern also lists several allegations against his superior Millard – who is named as a defendant in the suit, alongside the UC Regents – in court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Stern, Millard allegedly lied on a university audit, ordered a dispatcher to lie to a member of the public, mismanaged the release of a trainee officer, “lacked leader and management abilities” and “refused to address issues related to retaliation against officers who made protected disclosures.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stern additionally alleges that on Aug. 19, 2018, after he reported to Millard that other UCPD officers were “legitimately in fear of Smith,” Millard dismissed Stern’s concerns and refused to “address harassment concerns of his fellow officers.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Millard, like Smith, is also named in the other recent UCPD lawsuits. Stern and the plaintiffs of the other lawsuits accuse Millard of covering for Smith, Savagalio and Rothermel’s behavior. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith has not worked with the UCPD since December 2017; he filed his own lawsuit under the pseudonym John Doe against the department in March 2019, alleging that he was harassed and retailed against by his fellow officers for reporting a number of behaviors within the department. His suit detailed alleged police mockery of Chancellor Henry T. Yang, fellow officers and sexual assault and rape victims by members of the department, as well as racial discrimination and the falsification of sexual assault reports.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stern is being represented by the same lawyers representing the Littles, Signa and Reyes. He is scheduled to appear in court again in December. </span></p>\n<p>“Officer Stern filed for the same reasons his fellow officers have, because the UCSBPD and UC Regents fostered an environment of endemic discrimination,” Stern’s lawyer Antonio Castillo said in an email.</p>\n<p>“He filed because it’s long overdue that the UCSB and UC Regents take responsibility for the harm they allowed to occur.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
