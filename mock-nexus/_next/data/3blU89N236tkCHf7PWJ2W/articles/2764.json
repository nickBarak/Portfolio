sheet … We were able to move that sign-in sheet,” Le said. <em>Photo submitted anonymously</em></p></div>\n<p>“The petition misled since it was stating that it was mainly meant for the expansion of the Food Bank without clearly stating of the expansion of the UCen by increasing student fees,” advisor Rodolfo Ortiz said at the Food Bank Committee’s meeting.</p>\n<p>“The petition was put next to the sign-in sheet which caused students to mistake between the forms,” Vice Chair Tabitha Yuen said at the meeting.</p>\n<p>The minutes reference the petition as having been “set-up by Hieu Le at the Food Bank lounge last week.”</p>\n<p>Le, however, did not respond when asked if he had set up the petition in the food bank himself.</p>\n<p>Le acknowledged that the petition had been placed “next to the sign-in sheet for the actual food bank.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve actually crossed off all the names of the students who mistakenly signed onto that petition, mistaking it for the food bank sign-in sheet … We were able to move that sign-in sheet,” he said.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to “disapprove” the UCen expansion petition in the food bank during the March 2 meeting, meaning they will no longer allow the petition to be placed within the bank, according to first-year history major James Ferraro.</p>\n<p>“The ballot language is long and extensive … What I would argue is that people aren’t going to look through it in depth, people are going to vote for things and not see it, and so people are going to pass a fee raise,” Ferraro said.</p>\n<p>Funding for the project will come from a combination of student fees, the university itself and an alumni donation fund, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“We’ve raised about $2.5 million on campus equities, not donors yet,” Le said. “There is an anticipation that we’re gonna raise quite a good amount, but we don’t have a certain figure in mind yet.”</p>\n<p>Senator Alexandra Gessesse and Dumlao both said Le and his fellow students have not been open regarding fees when approaching students about the petition.</p>\n<p>“Not only have I witnessed [this], but constituents have told me that they’re not being told the fact that their student fees are going to be increased,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>“The issue is, even if we get donors and we assume that they’re going to give us $10 million, there’s still a budget that needs to be covered that would be from the student expense,” she added.</p>\n<p>Dumlao explained the project is being publicized as expanding the food bank and improving the UCen rather than focusing on the fact that student fees will rise.</p>\n<p>“I’ve heard from multiple people, both people who have been asked to sign the petition and … people who Hieu has been soliciting to work with him, that they have been told not to say or explicitly mention right off the bat that student fees will be raised if you sign that,” he said.</p>\n<p>Le denied not fully explaining the petition to students.</p>\n<p>“The cost is reflected in the petition, and our process is to hold the highest standards of integrity,” Le said. “Students at this university are very smart, and they know what they’re signing and they know what the idea is. Our job is to educate them on the process.”</p>\n<p>According to the petition, the UCen is now more than 50 years old, was designed to accommodate 17,000 students and was last updated in 1994. Currently, UCSB has more than 25,000 students and 6,800 faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>It is projected that 28,000 students will be enrolled by 2025, the petition says.</p>\n<p>“These facilities can no longer support the needs of our growing community, nor are they designed to keep up with the ever-changing and increasing technological demands of the current generation,” the petition reads.</p>\n<p>The project was first proposed six years ago, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“All three sponsors, A.S., the Division of Student Affairs and the University Center worked and consulted with students, clubs and organizations,” Le said. “The Office of Budget &amp; Planning was the one who drafted the [current] proposal.”</p>\n<p>If the petition is placed on the ballot and students vote in favor of it, student fees will increase $21.42 per quarter during Fall Quarter 2018. The increase will remain an additional $21.42 per quarter until Fall Quarter 2022, at which point it will increase to a “maximum” of $99.61 per quarter, including summer, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“We’re addressing an overcrowded campus; students are competing against each other for spots, spots inside the classroom; people are sitting in the aisles; students are waiting two weeks to see a psychological or academic counselor,” Le said.</p>\n<p>“Essentially, what we’re looking at is that students are competing against each other for spots, rather than we’re not addressing the issue in terms of providing access, and fair access, to each and every single one of our campus community [members],” he added.</p>\n<p>The petition needs 3,116 signatures to be placed on the ballot for students to vote on during Spring Quarter, according to Le. The deadline to get these signatures is March 16 and as of Wednesday night, the petition has approximately 2,000 signatures.</p>\n<p><em>Shomik Mukherjee contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Gessesse said “constituents,” not “kids.”</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the March 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

His older brother, Chris, attended UCSB through an exchange program and also played for the men’s team.</p>\n<p>“The game is more physical in Australia,” Gronow said. “I used to get kicked out [of matches] a lot, but I think I’ve adapted.”</p>\n<p>Still, Gronow is tied for second on the team with 20 points. The 6’3” driver has five goals to go along with 15 assists in seven games this season.</p>\n<p>“He is a powerhouse on the right side,” Golic said. “He will really help us.”</p>\n<p>With aspirations to play for the Australian National team, Gronow had his first breakout game against #7 Pacific in the NorCal Tournament at UC Berkeley on Sept. 19, where he netted a hat-trick to lead the Gauchos to an 11-6 victory.</p>\n<p>“It was a very promising performance,” Golic said.</p>\n<p>Like Gronow, Komadinic’s road to UCSB began outside of the country. The Serbian native began playing water polo at a young age and was a member of the Serbian Junior National Team.</p>\n<p>“His English is real bad,” Vincze said. “But he is actually really funny.”</p>\n<p>Komadinic plays center back, a position described by polo players as one of the toughest in the game. However, the freshman has been doing a commendable job, impressing the teams’ top guns.</p>\n<p>“He’s a really good player,” Golic said. “He is able to push other team’s 2-meters back and that pushes their whole offense back.”</p>\n<p><span><div id=\"attachment_26453\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">[media-credit name=”Photo Courtesy of Matt Gronow” align=”alignright” width=”250″]<a href=\"http://www.dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/freshmen-feature-newbies-play-years/usethis/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-26453\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-26453\" data-attachment-id=\"26453\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/freshmen-feature-newbies-play-years/usethis/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS.jpg?fit=1956%2C1551&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1956,1551\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"13\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D300\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1284206935\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"125\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"USETHIS\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS.jpg?fit=250%2C198&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS.jpg?fit=888%2C704&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS-250x198.jpg?resize=250%2C198\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"198\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-26453\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS.jpg?resize=250%2C198&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS.jpg?resize=1024%2C812&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS.jpg?w=1956&amp;ssl=1 1956w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]<p id=\"caption-attachment-26453\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Freshman 2-meter defender Lazar Komadinic pushes the ball up the pool.

He has committed several penalties in his first season as a Gaucho, including an ejection in the team’s last game against #6 UC Irvine within the first three minutes of the first period.</p>\n<p>“He’s a little too aggressive,” said Golic, who also comes from Serbia. “He’ll need a few more games to adjust.”</p>\n<p>Teammates consider Komadinic funny — sometimes because of his struggles with English.</p>\n<p>“We all make fun of him for it,” Gronow said. “But we try to help him when we can.”</p>\n<p>Still, Komadinic has fit well with the team.</p>\n<p>“He’s actually a really chill guy,” Vincze said.</p>\n<p>Out of the pool, Gronow has a tendency to talk in his sleep. He also sleepwalks, including one alleged incident in which Vincze woke up to Gronow standing over him.</p>\n<p>“He was in a bear pose, ready to attack,” Vincze said.</p>\n<p>Of the incident, Gronow claims he was awake and thought he was escaping spiders in his bed.</p>\n<p>“I think [my sleepwalking] used to shock him,” Gronow said. “But now he’s used to it.”</p>\n<p>Gronow, Komadinic and the rest of the Gaucho squad are currently preparing for the SoCal Tournament, which will be held at UCLA beginning Oct. 2. There, the team may have another chance to play Stanford, who has beaten UCSB in each of their past three meetings.</p>\n<p>“Our ultimate team goal is a national title,” Gronow said.</p><div

the Womxn’s Commission</em></p></div>\n<p>Womxn of color and their allies came together for this year’s Womxn of Color Conference on Saturday, Feb. 3, to discuss the issues minority womxn face with media representation, mental health and generational trauma.</p>\n<p>This year’s theme, “From Ashes to Activism: Rise through Resistance,” was reflected in the speakers, workshops and caucus spaces held throughout the day. The Associated Students Womxn’s Commission hosted the event.</p>\n<p>Ilene Ochoa, a fourth-year sociology major and senate liaison to the Womxn’s Commission, said the event was important for womxn of color in the present political climate.</p>\n<p>“The board liked the idea of rising from the ashes, being reborn like a phoenix, because even though you’ve gone through hardships, you still come out strong,” Ochoa said in an email.</p>\n<p>Zahira Kelly-Cabrera, an Afro-Dominicana writer, artist and international speaker, kicked off the event with a compelling speech about being an Afro-Latina.</p>\n<p>Kelly-Cabrera talked about her struggles with self-identity and with being marginalized even within her own Latinx community. She told a story of resilience amidst the hate she received from individuals who disapproved of her voicing self-acceptance as a womxn of color.</p>\n<p>She also discussed self-growth and resistance despite her experiences of toxic relationships and feeling like she did not belong to any community.</p>\n<p>Many attendees considered the speaker a highlight of the conference.</p>\n<p>“I enjoyed the keynote speaker [because] the space was intimate and powerful when she was sharing her story,” Ochoa said.</p>\n<p>Two workshop sessions succeeded Kelly-Cabrera.</p>\n<p>Sessions A and B featured various workshops focusing on topics such as mental health healing and effectively using radio as a platform for womxn of color to make their voices heard.</p>\n<p>Deborah Williams, a second-year political science major, attended a workshop called “Revolutionary Motherhood And Growing Up In The Movement: Two Generations Of Transnational Feminists.”</p>\n<p>“I got a better understanding of women’s roles and how they are changing today and how my mothers and grandmothers role differ from how I’m going to pursue my role as a mother,” Williams said. “I am going to foster that new generation with male and female equality.”</p>\n<p>KCSB-FM’s Radio Xicana host, Cecilia, lead the workshop called “Navigating the AirWaves: Muxeres en Radio.”</p>\n<p>She said her passion for the workshop stemmed from exploring the construct of identity through a more authentic platform in comparison to media representation.</p>\n<p>Hour-long caucus spaces, which are safe spaces for different identifications to bond over shared experiences, followed the sessions.</p>\n<p>Adena Badawi, an attendee from Orange County, explained the importance behind the caucuses.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it’s really important for womxn of color to have an outlet where we can all come together and share our experiences and form connections, and I’ve definitely accomplished that today through all the great people like me that I’ve met,” said Badawi.</p>\n<p>Attendees expanded on why the Womxn of Color Conference plays a key role in the fight for equality.</p>\n<p>Williams added that it was vital for college campuses to raise awareness and encourage participation in events such as this.</p>\n<p>“I think by coming to these conferences, I’m able to see more people like myself and relate to their experiences,” Samantha Mejia, a second-year sociology major, said.</p>\n<p>Maria Gonzales, a second-year global studies major, discussed the role that the Womxn of Color Conference plays on campus.</p>\n<p>Gonzales explained that UCSB has a lack of safe spaces for students of color on campus and said students of color often do not feel a sense of belonging in higher institutions.</p>\n<p>Though the majority of attendees were minority womxn, a few allies attended in order to show their support, get educated and gain perspective.</p>\n<p>“Men don’t support womxn very well so I feel like I need to step up and be an example to other men, and I need to learn how to do that properly,” Fred Atef, a visitor from Orange County, said.</p>\n<p>The Womxn’s Commission considered the day as a success, and Ochoa said that the event re-motivated her to continue her work as a political activism.</p>\n<p>“I see how important this work is in our community and how it can empower other womxn of color,” Ochoa said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

organization, the remaining funds will be used to pay for special projects and community events throughout the year that are sponsored by KCSB Radio. <em>Tamari Dzotsenidze/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The student-run radio station struggled to match previous fund drives which raised $35,000 in 2017 and $29,000 the year before.</p>\n<p>Miles Bishop, KCSB general manager, explained that last year’s Thomas Fire impacted the station’s ability to advertise for the event and win over donors.</p>\n<p>“[The fires] really put us out of commission for the whole of December,” he explained.</p>\n<p>In previous years, the fund drive’s planning started in November and had about three-and-a-half months for setting up and advertising. This year, that time was cut down by a month.</p>\n<p>Besides preparation issues, Bishop said that conflicting fundraising relief aid for the Thomas Fire and Montecito mudslides was another factor in the drop in donations.</p>\n<p>Although he hadn’t cross-checked KCSB’s donor list, he guessed that the previous contributors were providing more towards relief efforts.</p>\n<p>“Some people weren’t really comfortable donating to us when there’s other causes for direct relief,” he said.</p>\n<p>The radio station’s event faced another roadblock with the adoption of a last-minute advertising pitch to contribute 10 percent of every $1,000 dollars collected by KCSB to the Direct Relief organization assisting in aid for areas affected by the fires and Montecito mudslides.</p>\n<p>This pledge required KCSB to tiptoe over university warnings and get an official invoice from Direct Relief in order to fulfill that promise.</p>\n<p>According to Bishop, “The university didn’t want us to act as agents of [Direct Relief]. We can’t say we’re ‘donating’ 10 percent. We have to say we’re contributing to them, but not on their behalf.”</p>\n<p>Despite conflict and delays, the radio station continued the fund drive that consisted of 24-hour radio shows that asked listeners to donate. They also offered listeners “thank you gifts” like vinyl records, concert tickets and others.</p>\n<p>KCSB also sponsored festival events in downtown Santa Barbara and hosted an open-mic night fundraiser in Goleta.</p>\n<p>After contributing 10 percent of every $1,000 raised to the Direct Relief organization, the remaining funds will be used to pay for special projects and community events throughout the year that are sponsored by KCSB Radio.</p>\n<p>Despite the challenges, Bishop is satisfied with everything he and his team put together.</p>\n<p>“In the grand scheme of things, 23k is pretty good and I’m really proud of everyone I’m working with, especially given the circumstances,” he said.</p>\n<p>While the official fundraiser has ended, online donations will still be collected until March 16, through PayPal and Network for Good.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the March 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of the story stated KCSB would donate “10 percent to the Direct Relief organization.” The station will donate 10 percent of every $1,000 raised. The story also stated Bishop referred to KCSB’s 2017 donor list and “contested” that the donors were now putting money toward relief efforts. Bishop said he hadn’t cross-checked the donors between this year and last and he only “guessed” that the donors were contributing money elsewhere.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81850\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/kcsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81850\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/kcsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/kcsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/kcsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/kcsb/","id":2763,"author":{"id":224,"name":"Spencer Sween"},"related":[2762,2761,2760],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
