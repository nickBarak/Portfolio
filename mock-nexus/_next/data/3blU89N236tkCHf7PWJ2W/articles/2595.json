Not just for the students here at UCSB, but for the entire world. There are millions of people fleeing from a country torn apart by violence; Paris, Beirut and countries all across Africa and the Middle East have been the victims of terrorist attacks; there have been more mass shootings in the U.S. than there have been days; the list goes on and on.</p>\n<p>With so much anger, hatred and violence in the world, it’s so easy to fall into fear. But that’s exactly the point of terrorism … to make us feel scared. Because, when humans feel scared, it’s a scientifically proven fact that creativity, empathy, generosity, intelligence, performance and pretty much all higher functioning decreases. We become animals of instinct and reaction, rather than beings of intellect and creation.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66923\" style=\"width: 710px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1379591936\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66922\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66923\" data-attachment-id=\"66923\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/editor-in-chief-sends-his-wishes-this-holiday/emile/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?fit=1920%2C1080&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"emile\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66923\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile-1024x576.jpg?resize=700%2C394\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66923\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>It’s no revelation that everybody is affected by terrorism, whether it’s through the pain of losing a loved one, pain of being scared of attacks on ourselves or pain for humanity as a whole, we all feel it. But the problem is that we have begun to let that dictate how we feel everything. Everyday function is marred by the possibility of danger, so we keep our heads low and try to make sure we have enough just in case, trusting that everybody else will do the same — it’s not our responsibility how anyone else lives, right?</p>\n<p>Wrong. Humans are intrinsically wired for empathy, that’s why we have these things called mirror neurons. If we watch something happen, our brains light up as if it were happening to us. Our nature is to survive, yes, but our nature is also to care.</p>\n<p>I’m not trying to say that we all should walk around feeling guilty that we’re not sponsoring a refugee or anything like that — quite the opposite. I’m saying that everybody can help just by fighting back against the terror that is slowly creeping into our brains. It’s as easy as a smile. Next time you’re walking or biking around, keep a smile on your face. You’d be amazed at how many people smile back.</p>\n<p>Whenever you feel that inclination toward withdrawing into your shell, remember that is not your nature. That is somebody trying to manipulate you into silence, into complacency, into fear. You don’t have to accept the negativity that is being fed to you every day.</p>\n<p>I don’t mean to say you should ignore it at all; you need to see it, to observe it, to understand it. You need to process it in your own way. But then you learn and move on. You need to remember that you can play for one of two teams: fear or peace.</p>\n<p>If you feed your fear, what do you think you’ll notice everyday? Things that make you scared. You’ll live under a layer of doubt, uncertainty and selfishness. You’ll make choices based on what is best to annul your current fear without thinking about the long-term. That’s not an opinion, that’s science. Fear demands short-term rewards.</p>\n<p>So a piece of advice for this holiday season, and forever, is to choose to be confident, to be brave, to be happy for all the small victories and gifts in your life, to be peaceful and welcoming when you can and to handle yourself like you matter, because you do. You never know how far a smile can go. The more you look for the positive things in this world, the more you’ll find them and, chances are, the more you’ll create them.</p>\n<p>If nothing else, just remember that today you are not a victim, and that means you have the power to change things. You don’t need to be a Senator to enact change. Nothing ever stays the same. So ask yourself, are you making the world a happier or darker place today? You have the power to do both, and whether you like it or not, you’re doing one of them.</p>\n<p>Go out and enjoy this holiday season, even with all the tragedy. Enjoy it extra just to show the world that you won’t listen when they try to spook you. Enjoy it extra just because you can. Enjoy it extra because your happiness might just make all the difference.</p>\n<p>You matter, and even if you die tomorrow, you are creating your legacy every day with everything you say and everything you do. Don’t let that scare you, though. You can handle it.</p>\n<p>Happy Holidays from Emile Nelson</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, Dec. 3 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66922\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/editor-in-chief-sends-his-wishes-this-holiday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66922\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/editor-in-chief-sends-his-wishes-this-holiday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/editor-in-chief-sends-his-wishes-this-holiday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/editor-in-chief-sends-his-wishes-this-holiday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/editor-in-chief-sends-his-wishes-this-holiday/","id":2595,"author":{"id":139,"name":"Emile Nelson"},"related":[2594,2593,2592],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":139,"name":"Emile Nelson","biography":"Not available","articles":[2595,2695,2697,2750,4678,4709],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

F&amp;B funded the festival $13,000.</p>\n<p>The American Society for Mechanical Engineers (ASME) requested $8,000 to install solar lights in Greek Park, part of a larger project to install solar lights throughout Isla Vista. The installation at Greek Park will serve as a prototype for the larger project.</p>\n<p>Third-year mechanical engineering major Matt DeVogelaere said the project is designed to combat the infrastructure deficiencies in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We’re requesting money to provide solar power in Isla Vista, hopefully starting with Greek Park,” DeVogelaere said. “Isla Vista has suffered from insufficient infrastructure advancements and we would love to have lights in our parks.”</p>\n<p>A.S.

(IRS) after filing IRS Form 990 for three consecutive years, having failed to do so for 12 years prior.</p>\n<p>IRS Form 990 is a tax form for tax-exempt organizations which outlines organization activities and finances. By law, the University of California is exempt from filing an IRS Form 990 because it is recognized as a government affiliated organization under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 115 and IRC 501(c)(3). The IRS is currently deciding whether Associated Students is exempt from filing IRS Form 990 based on its affiliation with the UC.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal said the current A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez addressed the IRS non-compliance issue by hiring lawyers to work with A.S. after she was hired in 2008.</p>\n<p>“From 2008 to 2012, that’s when we were in contact with lawyers,” Villarreal said. “Not just UC lawyers but we also brought in outside lawyers just to try to figure out where we were. We contacted the general counselor for the UC, so with their advice, we went to another lawyer who specializes in IRS matters.”</p>\n<p>Marquez said the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) contacted her about the IRS non-compliance issue.</p>\n<p>“I had been working here in my office and UCOP called me up one day asking me why we haven’t been<strong> s</strong>ubmitting our own 990 document for the prior 12 years,” Marquez said. “I researched it and I found out the reason; prior to that there had been an understanding that turned out to be a misunderstanding.”</p>\n<p>According to Villarreal, A.S. did not file the form for 12 years due to confusion about the relationship between the UCen and UC.</p>\n<p>“The reason why we weren’t filing before that was because at the time, we shared the same track ID number with the UCen because technically we are in UCen property,” Villarreal said. “Because the University files for the UCen, the UCen thought the [University was] filing for Associated Students. But they were not.”</p>\n<p>Marquez said it is difficult to categorize the tax status of A.S because it follows policies from UC Regents, A.S. Legal Code and regulations as a nonprofit organization.</p>\n<p>“The mix-up occurred because we are both a department for the campus and system, and we also hold our own tax ID number,” Marquez said. “Students wanting to be independent from the university have maintained both levels of responsibility.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said A.S. is working with lawyers to research whether A.S. should be recognized as a UC-affiliated organization.</p>\n<p>“We’re not even sure if we have to file 990s and that is still something we’re still trying to figure out with our lawyers because we’re under a governmental entity which is the University of California,” Villarreal said. “So even now we’re still working on exactly figuring out if this is something we have to do.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said because A.S. has an unclear affiliation with the UC, he does not know whether A.S. will incur penalties from the IRS.</p>\n<p>“It is a possibility that there could be fines incurred, but I’m not really sure how much,” Villarreal said. “But we have the funds that we can use for that and we can take care of it if need be. I don’t expect that to happen, but it could.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year political science major Louis Mariano said the IRS compliance issues are mostly “small technical things” that must be fixed to maintain a nonprofit organization.</p>\n<p>“IRS issues have been present in the Association for the past few years and it is an issue that the A.S Executive Director has been dealing with, informing the president and senate with updates,” Mariano said in an email.</p>\n<p>Mariano said it is unlikely the student body will be affected by the A.S.’s non-compliance with the IRS as long as A.S. continues to communicate with the IRS.</p>\n<p>“Personally, I believe that there isn’t much impact for the student body and student fees as long as the issue is being dealt with, which the Executive Director has been doing as mentioned before,” Mariano said in an email.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66758\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/associated-students-issued-compliance-check-from-irs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66758\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/associated-students-issued-compliance-check-from-irs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/associated-students-issued-compliance-check-from-irs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/associated-students-issued-compliance-check-from-irs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/associated-students-issued-compliance-check-from-irs/","id":2593,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[2592,2591,2590],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Mountain Climber Alex Honnold Summits Campbell Hall Stage","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Honnold-climbing-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Honnold-climbing-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Mountain climber Alex Honnold spoke on his recent book, Alone on the Wall, Sunday evening at Campbell Hall.

The majority of the audience consisted of current or former rock climbers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honnold said he was not born with the ability to climb, but succeeded by being committed to the sport.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was in no means elite, I just went to the gym five days a week,” Honnold said. “I would climb, I was always engrossed in climbing media.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honnold said his dad encouraged him to pursue mountaineering, but his mother did not understand the sport for many years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My mom didn’t know much about it until I was an adult and in magazines,” Honnold said. “At that point, she said ‘well it looks like you have a pretty good handle on it.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honnold said he will not go through with a climb if he is not totally comfortable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If I’m there and I feel fear thinking about the route … I go back and practice more.
