Constitution was spearheaded by A.S. President Austin Hechler and aims to decrease student fees by lowering UC Santa Barbara’s contributions to outside organizations. The UC Student Association (UCSA) and the United States Student Association (USSA), national and statewide student organizations, have been scrutinized due to UCSB paying higher than average fees.</p>\n<p>For fiscal year 2016-2017, UCSB A.S. paid $173,139 in dues to UCSA, $89,874 more than the next highest payer, UCLA A.S., which paid $83,265 according to the UCSA budget. The lowest contributor, UC Merced A.S., only paid $7,944.</p>\n<p>UCSB A.S. pays for over 30 percent of UCSA’s annual budget.</p>\n<p>UCSB students also pay much higher dues to USSA, a national student organization. The website states that schools pay an average of 50 cents to $1 per student, while UCSB pays over $7 per student per year.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75805\" style=\"width: 543px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75805\" data-attachment-id=\"75805\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/a-s-aims-to-lower-student-fees/graphic2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/graphic2.jpg?fit=533%2C631&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"533,631\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"graphic2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/graphic2.jpg?fit=211%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/graphic2.jpg?fit=533%2C631&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75805\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/graphic2.jpg?resize=533%2C631\" alt=\"\" width=\"533\" height=\"631\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/graphic2.jpg?w=533&amp;ssl=1 533w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/graphic2.jpg?resize=211%2C250&amp;ssl=1 211w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-75805\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The referendum states that “fee referendums may not exceed the average payment per student in member campuses of external organizations.” This does not prevent A.S. from entering or withdrawing from membership or senate allocating additional money to membership organizations.</p>\n<p>Hechler hopes that this referendum will make contributions fair, instead of having UCSB shoulder a majority of the cost.</p>\n<p>“We shouldn’t be paying over three times as much as the next highest school,” Hechler said. “It’s not fair that UCSB students have to bear the burden of paying for this entire association.”</p>\n<p>Hechler said A.S. has informed both UCSA and USSA of the referendum and is collaborating with them to ensure that their organizations are prepared and are able to be sustained despite the decrease in funding.</p>\n<p>Another amendment addresses the addition of new student fees, increasing the percentage of votes necessary to put a fee on the ballot. Currently, new A.S. fees that are on the ballot by student petition need only 51 percent to be added, while fees that are put on by Senate need 60 percent. The referendum would increase the votes necessary for all new fees to two-thirds.</p>\n<p>This referendum also makes it more difficult for student fees to be increased and reaffirmed. Existing lock-in fees must be reaffirmed every two years. The new legislation would mandate that fees that are up for reaffirmation must pass by 60 percent, while fees on the ballot for an increase must pass by 66 percent.</p>\n<p>These amendments will be sent to Elections Committee and will go through Senate at the end of the quarter before being sent to the UC Office of the President.</p>\n<p>The final bylaw proposes a cap on the amount spent by the Finance and Business Committee on conferences.</p>\n<p>Currently, A.S. Financial Policies and Procedures do not allow non-A.S. organizations to use A.S. funds for expenses related to off-campus conferences. Organizations that want to use funding for conferences can use a one-time exception allowing them to get the funding they need.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t make sense that a huge portion of the finance and business budget goes towards an exception to the rules. We need to either modify the rules or limit spending,” Ian Caples, A.S. Director of Budget and Finance, said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75804\" style=\"width: 626px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75804\" data-attachment-id=\"75804\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/a-s-aims-to-lower-student-fees/student-fees-graphic/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/student-fees-graphic.jpg?fit=616%2C563&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"616,563\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"student fees graphic\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/student-fees-graphic.jpg?fit=250%2C228&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/student-fees-graphic.jpg?fit=616%2C563&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75804\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/student-fees-graphic.jpg?resize=616%2C563\" alt=\"\" width=\"616\" height=\"563\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/student-fees-graphic.jpg?w=616&amp;ssl=1 616w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/student-fees-graphic.jpg?resize=250%2C228&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-75804\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The current proposal is to create a separate category specifically for conferences totaling $70,000, with a $150 per person cap. In previous years, around $80,000 was allocated towards conferences.</p>\n<p>Finance and Business Committee Chair Reilly Hobson emphasized that the goal of this bylaw was not to decrease student fees but to limit the amount of money spent off campus.</p>\n<p>“I think students don’t realize that the money that Finance and Business Committee has is coming from student fees,” Hobson said. “They think it’s from the university, and then we have to dispense it. It’s actually from students, so when they’re asking for like $600 per student to go to a conference, that’s like three people paying for one person to go.”</p>\n<p>Justice Dumlao, co-chair of the A.S. Queer Commission, said he believes a cap on conference spending will negatively affect minority students.</p>\n<p>“I think that limiting the spending on conferences is very detrimental to a lot of minority communities because a lot of the learning and community building and healing come from going to conferences,” Dumlao said. “I think in trying to limit that you are, in turn, oppressing the communities that you say you are supporting.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate is expected to vote on the conference cap on Wednesday.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, February 16, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Senators Bianca Fernandez and Batsheva Stoll first proposed the resolution to the Senate on Jan. 18. It passed Wednesday 21 to 2.</p>\n<p>The IIE Syria Consortium is a scholarship program designed to allocate admission space at universities to refugees whose education has been halted by the Syrian War. The Consortium aims to help refugee students continue their education at universities so they can eventually return to Syria and begin rebuilding their communities.</p>\n<p>Syrian students are unable to continue their education in Syria because their campuses are either destroyed or unsafe. The war has displaced over four million people, with as many as 450,000 between the ages of 18 and 22.</p>\n<p>The resolution was originally brought to the senators by Books Not Bombs, a campaign that encourages universities to join the IIE Syria Consortium. The same resolution has been proposed at other UC campuses and at the UC Student Association.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be the fourth school in the UC system to petition the Regents to join the Consortium, following Davis, Irvine and Berkeley.</p>\n<p>Bianca Fernandez, off-campus senator and second-year history of public policy major, said the university’s participation in the IIE Syria Consortium would show that UCSB is supportive of refugee students and their higher education.</p>\n<p>“Having the UC system give that opportunity and be that school that will help, indirectly, Syria rebuild itself [is] super important, and I think it’s a very progressive step for our school,” she said.</p>\n<p>The Syrian students’ financial aid will come from funding that is already reserved for international students, so U.S. students will not be affected by the resolution.</p>\n<p>However, Syrian students will receive priority admission to the university over other international students due to the severity of their country’s crisis.</p>\n<p>The resolution was drafted before President Trump’s immigration ban, which complicates the process of Syrian students getting to UCSB. The president’s executive order temporarily bans immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries and proposes the indefinite suspension of Syrian refugees from entering the country.</p>\n<p>Fernandez said she believes the resolution is still valuable despite Trump’s order because it demonstrates the university’s dedication to continuing the education of refugee students.</p>\n<p>“I still think it is super important that the UC system, especially UCSB, shows that we are accepting of Syrian refugees and we want to have a space for them on this campus,” she said. “We think it’s very important that students in Syria receive the higher education that they deserve.”</p>\n<p>The president’s immigration ban is currently being reviewed for constitutionality by federal judges. The executive order was temporarily blocked last Friday by a federal judge from Seattle.</p>\n<p>Fernandez said Syrian students’ presence at UCSB will provide “different viewpoints” on campus and make the campus “an even better place.”</p>\n<p>“They’ll make our campus more diverse and I think that’s something our campus is really proud of,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Feb. 9, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75602\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-s-passes-resolution-to-aid-syrian-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75602\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-s-passes-resolution-to-aid-syrian-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-s-passes-resolution-to-aid-syrian-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-s-passes-resolution-to-aid-syrian-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/a-s-passes-resolution-to-aid-syrian-students/","id":2434,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2433,2432,2431],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Party Emerges for A.S.

Last year’s election season saw the emergence of four new parties: The Response, Peer Action Coalition (P.A.C.), Campus United (CU) and Queer and Trans Student Body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CU became the dominant party in April, garnering 64 percent of the Senate and three out of five executive seats. The Response won seven seats on the Senate, and P.A.C. took the remaining two seats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would not wish to see something like that happen again. In my opinion, you would have it so that no one has the majority,” said Nawar Nemeh, third-year political science major and Isla Vista Party executive member. “That doesn’t mean we’re not going to try to dominate. That would be stupid of us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Nemeh, many of Isla Vista Party’s members were active in P.A.C. and The Response last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is an obvious overlap. I don’t think that’s an unfair assessment,” Nemeh said. He added that the party includes students with no previous experience in A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are about 40 active members in the Isla Vista Party, according to Nemeh. He said many of them represent the Black Student Union, El Congreso, Queer Commission, Multicultural Greek Council, UCSB Panhellenic and Inter-Fraternity Council, among other groups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked how the Isla Vista Party differentiates itself from others, on-campus senator Lesly Silva said the party is “grassroots” and “diverse.” Party members have not yet formed their platform, she said, because they are in the process of gathering input from a range of “historically underrepresented communities.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We reach out to communities asking, what do you need? … What has been on your mind?” she said. “This is a community-based party.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice Dumlao, a second-year global studies major, said party members contacted his group, the Queer Commission.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the past, it’s been an afterthought where people have created their parties and then came to the queer communities,” he said. “We really get a say on what the party is doing, and so we get that foundational support instead of support that we would get as an afterthought.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The aim of the Isla Vista Party, Nemeh said, is to change the structure of Senate so that students have increased “decision-making power” at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Citing the UC shared governance policy, which splits campus responsibility evenly between students, faculty and administration, Nemeh said students have “gotten the short end of the deal recently.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we want is to make sure that students have an actual decision-making power that’s not just one seat on an advisory committee. We want them to actually be the decision-makers,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan Lopez, off-campus senator and third-year sociology and economics double major, said the goal of this party is to elect student government officials who will use the power invested in them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to actually put people in positions where they will have a big influence and will use that influence, rather than putting people into a position because the title sounds nice,” Lopez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Nemeh, the name of the party is intended to localize the interests of A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to remind people, what do we actually love? What is actually our home? It’s Isla Vista,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CU will continue to run a full slate for this spring election. According to Niki Elyasi, a CU organizer and fourth-year biopsychology major, her party will maintain its same mission and values, even with the formation of a new party.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every year there’s more than one party. It’s definitely more competitive than when there’s only one party running,” she said. “I don’t see that changing Campus United style or Campus United mission. I don’t think you’ll see anything different from us. It’s up to the different parties what you’ll see from them.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75726\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/new-party-emerges-for-a-s-elections/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75726\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/new-party-emerges-for-a-s-elections/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/new-party-emerges-for-a-s-elections/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/new-party-emerges-for-a-s-elections/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/new-party-emerges-for-a-s-elections/","id":2435,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2434,2433,2432],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Christina Lim Remembered as ‘Everyone’s Friend’","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-09-at-11.09.45-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-09-at-11.09.45-AM.png?resize=684%2C559&ssl=1","description":"\"You could talk to her about anything at any time.

She formed a tight circle of friends while she was at UCSB, infecting acquaintances with her positivity and open mindedness.</p>\n<p>“She was always smiling,” Rod Gomez, a fourth-year environmental science major who met Lim when they were second-year students, said.</p>\n<p>While juggling a full course load in the engineering department, Lim managed a job at Curvature, paid her own bills and was always open to adventure. At Curvature, coworkers were impressed by her work ethic, and Lim had plans to continue working in Santa Barbara after graduating in June.</p>\n<p>Lim loved melodic dubstep beats and electronic dance music, especially the producer Seven Lions. She tried her hand at DJing for fun, friends said, and she was an avid supporter of her friend’s musical pursuits.</p>\n<p>Raghav Thirumulu, Lim’s housemate and close friend, said she had an impressive talent for video games, beating her friends at games she had just picked up. She also entertained an obsession with several television shows, including “Westworld,” “Black Mirror” and “The Walking Dead.”</p>\n<p>“She just gave off this energy that made your day so much easier,” Ming Guo, who also lived with Lim, said.</p>\n<p>Evelyn Choi met Lim during her first year, and soon considered her a best friend and a sister. The first night they met in Anacapa Residence Hall, the two fell asleep while talking and studying in the lounge. A custodial worker woke them up several hours later, and “From then on, I knew she was going to be someone really important in my life,” Choi said.</p>\n<p>Over four years, Choi became accustomed to Lim’s quirks — including her keen interest in World War II. Lim had posters of “Band of Brothers” and “The Pacific” throughout her room, and she considered the era one of the rawest moments in human emotion.</p>\n<p>Lim was also given a few goofy nicknames: “Chrispitos,” named after crispy taquitos, and “Christinith,” referencing the movie “The Other Guys.”</p>\n<p>Landon Peik, a fourth-year mechanical engineering major, met Lim for the first time at Hard Summer music festival. He remembers Choi leaning on Lim’s shoulder for the duration of a set by Porter Robinson, enjoying her friends’ company with their favorite music.</p>\n<p>College was a transformational time for Lim, her friends said, and she was always happy to go on hiking trips, to music festivals and spend time with people. She made her friends feel comfortable, while always challenging them with new ideas.</p>\n<p>Armando Muñoz, one of Lim’s housemates, described her as “one of the guys.”</p>\n<p>“You could talk to her about anything, at any time,” he said. “She was always down to listen and give advice. She could take it and dish it better than most guys.”</p>\n<p>Lim was extremely humble about her intelligence through years of hard work, friends said, and she never complained, even on her first 13-mile hike through the Sequoia Woods.</p>\n<p>Chris Tuch, a UCSB alumnus, met Lim as a resident assistant in Anacapa Residence Hall. The two were close, often staying up for hours watching Netflix shows, talking and playing Nintendo 64 games.<br>\n“She was a homie,” he said.</p>\n<p>The group of friends this week received an outpouring of support from neighbors, friends and students who crossed paths with Lim. Thirumulu created a donation page Monday in her honor which quickly exceeded the target goal of $5,000, raising over $8,139 in two days.</p>\n<p>Friends will hold a memorial in Lim’s honor this weekend, playing her favorite music to celebrate her life. Anyone who is interested in attending can contact Thirumulu at<em> rrthirumulu@gmail.com</em>. Lim’s family will also arrange a funeral ceremony later this month.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, Feb. 9, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75595\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/christina-lim-remembered-as-everyones-friend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75595\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/christina-lim-remembered-as-everyones-friend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/christina-lim-remembered-as-everyones-friend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/christina-lim-remembered-as-everyones-friend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/christina-lim-remembered-as-everyones-friend/","id":2433,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2432,2431,2430],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
