Anderle ruled that the school violated the due process requirements of the federal and state constitutions by pre-determining John’s guilt, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>“Instead of making that decision based upon facts, the law, and in fairness, [UCSB] has decided to do it their own way,” Anderle wrote in court documents.</p>\n<p>A separate panel of UCSB administrators reviewed the case in May 2018 and ultimately cleared him of all charges. The court ruled on Oct. 23 that John would be awarded court costs of $4,714.91.</p>\n<p>In its decision, the panel found that, “had the University considered available evidence at the inception of the case… John Doe’s suspension and charges probably would not have occured.”</p>\n<p>The panel “chastised” UCSB for “its failure to conduct even a rudimentary investigation before charging,” said Bob Ottilie, John’s attorney.</p>\n<p>As of October 2018, John is attending a different university.</p>\n<p>This is the third case the Nexus has reported on in recent months <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-08-15/uc-regents-found-in-contempt-of-court-expelled-student-allowed-to-return-to-ucsb/\">involving</a> the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-22/sb-superior-court-reverses-ucsb-students-suspension-for-sexual-assault/\">reversal</a> of a Title IX case.</p>\n<p>John, a San Diego resident, was initially suspended after his former high school girlfriend, referred to as Jane Doe in court documents, posted a video online after an argument between the two.</p>\n<p>Both were 17 years of age and living in San Diego at the time of the alleged argument on Aug. 13, 2016. John was enrolled at UCSB at that time, but had not yet officially begun attending classes.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, John and Jane got into an argument over his private social media accounts. When John saw his girlfriend recording the argument, there was a “scuffle for the phone,” court documents stated.</p>\n<p>His girlfriend “left an impression” in the video that John hit her. John denied that he threatened or hit her.</p>\n<p>After an unaffiliated UCSB student saw the video on Jane’s public Twitter account and reported it to UCSB, University of California Police Department (UCPD) detectives from UCSB drove down to San Diego and arrested John. He was placed in a juvenile detention facility in San Diego.</p>\n<p>John was later released into the custody of his mother on Sep. 2 after a judge found that he was not a threat to anyone.</p>\n<p>UCPD did not inform the San Diego Police Department of John’s case, making this the first case in the country where an arrest was ordered by the Title IX office, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>Ottilie called UCSB’s charges and behavior “outrageous” in a press release sent out Thursday.</p>\n<p>“The University suspended this poor kid in September 2016, and totally barred him from campus, and then failed to even initiate a meaningful Title IX investigation for months,” Ottilie said in a press release.</p>\n<p>“This was what so offended the court; his suspension was tied to an investigation that initially never went forward, and when it did, he was totally exonerated. Why did it take 19 months when the University never presented any evidence that it did not have 19 months earlier.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p>Dozens of residents received an email from University and Community Housing Services on Oct. 9, alerting them that their triple rooms would be converted to double rooms.</p>\n<p>These vacancies are from students who never showed up to school at the beginning of Freshman Summer Start Program (FSSP), dropped out during FSSP or moved into different residence halls at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2018, according to Jill Hurd, the Director of Residential and Community Living.</p>\n<p>“The additional San Nicolas spaces were [used] to accommodate an increased enrollment in the Freshman Summer Start Program,” said Mario Muñoz, the associate director of University and Community Housing Services.</p>\n<p>“Now that [the university has] gotten past the uncertainty of move-in, we are removing those temporary spaces.”</p>\n<p>The higher enrollment in FSSP is consistent with a higher enrollment rate for freshmen overall. As more students accept offers to attend UCSB, the amount of students who need on-campus housing increases.</p>\n<p>Because of this, the number of triples offered in San Nicolas grows year by year, according to Hurd.</p>\n<p>Spaces in the rooms were also left open for international students and emergency room situations, according to Hurd. Now, three weeks into the quarter, those vacancies are being addressed.</p>\n<p>The Department of Residential and Community Living finished accommodating all the students on the waiting list last week, meaning that the remaining vacancies in San Nicolas Hall would not be filled.</p>\n<p>For some students, this meant that those who originally requested triples now find themselves in double rooms.</p>\n<p>Residents who requested triples for financial reasons and found themselves in doubles were left with few options when notified of the de-tripling.</p>\n<p>It is within the right of UCSB to change a resident’s rooming situation from a double to a triple, or vice versa, at any time, according to the University Residence Hall Contract.</p>\n<p>“When one student vacates due to reassignment or termination of contract, the room reverts to a double occupancy room and the rate for the two remaining students increases to the double occupancy rate,” the housing contract reads.</p>\n<p>The estimated cost difference between a double and triple room for these residents totals $1675: $375 for the remainder of fall quarter, and $650 per quarter for winter and spring.</p>\n<p>Since all empty beds in previously-tripled rooms were removed from San Nicolas, affected residents are left with two options if they need to remain in a triple: a roommate swap or a residence hall switch.</p>\n<p>A roommate swap is when students communicate with other residents in the building who have a double room preference and swap rooms with them, Assistant Resident Director of San Nicolas Residence Hall Ruth Quintanilla said in an email.</p>\n<p>“This would allow you to move into a triple and switch with resident who wants a double,” she wrote.</p>\n<p>Both of these residents would fill out roommate swap forms and the resident being detripled could avoid paying the cost of a double room.</p>\n<p>For William Cui, a first-year statistical science major, a roommate swap led to finally getting the triple room type he originally requested. Cui and his roommate intended on being in a double, but due to over-enrollment of FSSP, were placed in a triple.</p>\n<p>“[We] were all set with a double until a few days before we moved in they told us we were stuck with a random third roommate,” Cui said in an email.</p>\n<p>“They had only sent out the original email notifying us about the possibility of doubles being turned into triples a week or so before our move in date.”</p>\n<p>As other rooms were being de-tripled, Cui connected with the Resident Director to switch rooms with two students who needed a triple for financial reasons.</p>\n<p>“We successfully switched with them so we live in a double now and the two people we switched with live in our old room with the third roommate we got assigned to. Our FSSP experience would have just been a lot better in general if we had gotten our double as originally planned and trying to move out was really tedious and stressful,” he added.</p>\n<p>While Cui and his roommate agreed to switch rooms, others who originally requested doubles but were placed in triples may not be as eager to do a roommate swap.</p>\n<p>For residents being de-tripled who cannot find residents to swap with, there is a second option: a residence hall switch, where a resident in a de-tripled room has the option of moving out of the building and into a different residence hall altogether. This process is facilitated by the resident director of San Nicolas Hall.</p>\n<p>Quintanilla said that if the switch from paying for a triple to paying for a double posed a concern for students, then they could file a Cost of Attendance appeal to the Office of Financial Aid.</p>\n<p>An email from University and Community Housing Services clarified that this option is only “for students who have expenses that supersede the budget allocation for rent.”</p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.5 of the Oct. 25 print edition of the</i> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Their students, in turn, are unable to access several tools, McClelland said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elrod said there is a “variety of benefits” that employees get, but the lack of registration has resulted in them not receiving the benefits to which they are entitled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UAW 2865 and Graduate Student Association (GSA) have been working together in an attempt to help students avoid losing benefits and payment for their work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve written up a collective survey together that we’ve been circulating on our list serves, sending to our department reps in GSA on Facebook, trying to get as many graduate students as possible who are having issues to respond to it,” GSA President Cierra Sorin said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Student workers] should also recognize that the only way to speak to the university as an equal would be through… [a] collective response,” Elrod said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCPath malfunction has also affected undergraduate students who work within the school as tutors or readers, according to Daniel Lazar, one of the UAW 2865 Head Stewards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The union stated that they are working closely with the GSA to make sure students do not feel as though they are isolated and to make sure the university upholds their end of the contract.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The larger issue is whether students will band together to bring attention to the issue, Elrod said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lazar also expressed frustration over the university’s lack of quick and detailed responses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’ve just been stonewalling and haven’t responded. I’ve actually gotten contradictory information about the causes of the error… It’s clearly a university-wide problem, and there hasn’t been a university-wide response to it,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Union objected to the transition to UCPath from the start because these issues had already occurred at other universities last year. Despite this, the university proceeded with the transition, McClelland said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the issues are not resolved soon, UCPath members will not receive their October paychecks, leaving students unsure of their ability to pay rent, according to McClelland.</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.6 of the Oct. 25 print edition of the</i> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84532\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84532\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/","id":2196,"author":{"id":64,"name":"Aaron Berkness"},"related":[2195,2194,2193],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
