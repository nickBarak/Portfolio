The contest will be held 3-7 p.m Wednesday at Corwin Pavilion and is open to the public.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The annual event is hosted by UCSB’s Technology Management Program (TMP), with the goal of encouraging startups. In the past, winners have been awarded cash prizes ranging from $7,500 to $15,000. This year, the six teams will be competing for a pot of $40,000 in prize money. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The teams this year are Collatera, CRYPTIX, Delta Leaf Labs, OrganicMatters, Phanta Field and Wanderlease, each coming off a hard-fought semifinal round held on May 3. Twenty teams participated in the fair, and the best six were chosen to move on to this final round.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The finalists were decided by the public who attended the fair, but the winner on Wednesday will be determined by a panel of judges. Here are the six teams competing for the final prize:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collatera, which proposes a better method for diabetes detection and prevention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CRYPTIX, which is creating a ticket search engine to eliminate inflated ticket prices and fraud. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delta Leaf Labs, which aims to mass-produce non-addictive marijuana for medical purposes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OrganicMatters, which looks to partner with the poultry industry and turn their waste products into fertilizer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phanta Field, which is trying to create augmented reality glasses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wanderlease, which is making an app that aspires to make subleasing easier. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, OSMO won the competition. The four-person team designed a portable water sampling instrument to make it easier for scientists to collect water samples.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They received the first-place prize of $12,000, but all the teams that made it to the finals walked away from the event with cash prizes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surprisingly, the second-place team walked away with the most amount of money, having additionally been awarded the People’s Choice Award and the Citrix Impact Award. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dave Adornetto, entrepreneurship director for TMP, said there were no major changes this year in terms of format, but there were more people who signed up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s participants have been preparing since the competition started back in November with 38 teams. Throughout Winter Quarter and part of Spring Quarter, the teams have been taking the first few steps on their business models and have been receiving entrepreneurship education in TMP seminars.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All this preparation will reach its final culmination on Wednesday.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Tuesday, increasing tension between pro-Palestine and pro-Israel student groups days before a divestment resolution goes before Associated Students Senate today.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Students Supporting Israel, an international movement in support of the Jewish-Democratic state of Israel, created the sign with the support of Santa Barbara Hillel and Artists 4 Israel last week during “Israel Peace Week.” They installed the sign on May 4.</p>\n<p>The sign displays the word “Israel” in large block letters. Defacers spray painted the words “Free Palestine” across the front of it.</p>\n<p>Artists 4 Israel, an artist organization in support of Israel, began fixing the defaced sign Tuesday afternoon, adding the words “stop hate” across its entire surface.</p>\n<p>Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) proposed a resolution on April 23, urging A.S. to divest from companies that “occupy” Palestine territories. The A.S. Senate will vote on the resolution during tonight’s meeting in Corwin Pavilion.</p>\n<p>SJP specifically asks that UCSB and the UC Regents divest from Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Caterpillar and Hewlett Packard, although the group is asking the UC to divest from all companies that contribute to humans rights abuses in Palestine.</p>\n<p>UCSB A.S. is the only UC government that has not passed a divestment resolution in recent years.</p>\n<p>SJP released a statement on its Facebook page Wednesday morning “firmly and unequivocally” condemning the acts of vandalism and the accusations that SJP was affiliated with the incident.</p>\n<p>“Our group was in no way involved in this incident, and denounces vandalism of any student group’s displays,” the statement reads. “It would be foolish and inflammatory to lay blame upon this SJP for acts perpetrated by those who are not involved in our organization and act independently from us.”</p>\n<p>Nate Erez, the president of Students Supporting Israel and a fourth-year economics and accounting major, said he is not surprised the sign was defaced because “Free Palestine” was already written on the sign Friday in Sharpie.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77751\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77751\" data-attachment-id=\"77751\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-10/pro-israel-mural-defaced-amid-divestment-debate/18452374_10206796418428826_300039903_o/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/18452374_10206796418428826_300039903_o.jpg?fit=1334%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1334,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"18452374_10206796418428826_300039903_o\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/18452374_10206796418428826_300039903_o.jpg?fit=250%2C187&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/18452374_10206796418428826_300039903_o.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-77751\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/18452374_10206796418428826_300039903_o-1024x768.jpg?resize=800%2C600\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/18452374_10206796418428826_300039903_o.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/18452374_10206796418428826_300039903_o.jpg?resize=250%2C187&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/18452374_10206796418428826_300039903_o.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/18452374_10206796418428826_300039903_o.jpg?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/18452374_10206796418428826_300039903_o.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/18452374_10206796418428826_300039903_o.jpg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/18452374_10206796418428826_300039903_o.jpg?w=1334&amp;ssl=1 1334w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77751\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Tamari Dzotsenidze / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Erez said, however, that he is “personally saddened” by the vandalism.</p>\n<p>“I personally worked so hard to get these artists up here to create something positive for not only our community, but what we felt was the entire UCSB community,” Erez said.</p>\n<p>According to Erez, Artists 4 Israel wrote words such as “love” and “peace” in Arabic, Hebrew and English across the front of the sign and allowed student groups to write messages of love and unity on the back.</p>\n<p>UCSB student Jewish groups released a unity statement Monday in opposition to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement (BDS), a group supporting divestment from Israel.</p>\n<p>Erez said BDS “brings out anti-Semitism” on campuses across the nation and said divestment resolutions are “discriminatory” toward Jewish students and the religion.</p>\n<p>He said such resolutions and groups “single out” one side of the complex conflict between Israel and Palestine and place blame “solely and squarely on Israel.”</p>\n<p>“I believe you can be pro-Israel and pro-Palestine and pro-peace all at the same time,” Erez added. “And we should invest in peace, not boycott one side or the other.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Director of Legislative Accountability Steven Kwok facilitated the discussion, which focused heavily on improving candidate safety as competition during elections runs strong. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">External Vice President for Local Affairs candidate Justice Dumlao was injured in a bike accident while trying to find the best place for his campaign board the Sunday before active campaign began. As a tradition, candidates gather at Pardall Tunnel on Sunday then race across campus to distribute campaign material.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kian Maalizadeh, third-year biology major and transfer senator-elect, proposed a “lottery system” for assigning spots, which he said will eliminate the need for a race and increase the physical safety of students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student suggested that the boards move from the bike path to the front of the library to avoid the battle of best placement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another issue discussed at the meeting was the structure and timeline of the election cycle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After discussion, the ASEB decided active campaigning would move to Week Two of Spring Quarter in order to allow candidates and other students involved in the election process to concentrate on their midterms. This means that elections season would end during Week Three of Spring Quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candidates also faced problems surrounding the rules of the declaration of candidacy. Media outlets such as the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bottom Line</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported on the students’ candidacy soon after the declaration deadline at the end of Winter Quarter, but the candidates were not allowed to officially comment on their intent to run until Week Four of Spring Quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s like after declaration of candidacy you can’t acknowledge your own candidacy, which doesn’t make a lot of sense,” said Kristin Hsu, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">third-year political science major and external vice president for statewide affairs-elect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several students expressed concern over the environmental implications of the campaigning boards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amy Koo, a second-year political science major, said reducing the number of boards for each party could reduce waste and encourage candidates to use other methods of campaigning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we are moving towards a waste-free UCSB, then that’s something that can be restricted,” Koo said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meeting attendees agreed that the ASEB must be more involved in the campaigning process to reduce party harassment and hostility. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hate the fact that we are all friends, and yet for two weeks we hate each other,” Koo said. “[It’s] just not a good system, and it just breeds a lot of hostility, and it makes us less likely to work with each other in the future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kwok said the tense political climate results from the “atmosphere” created between parties.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It doesn’t have to be as

In April, both Luan and Hu leed UCSB’s Go Club to a championship victory in the last round of the Collegiate Go League. Hu is set to be president of the small but successful club next year. <em>Tamari Dzotsenidze / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Facing off against each other, Rex Luan and Stephen Hu, current and future president of UC Santa Barbara’s Go Club, sit in perfect contrast.</p>\n<p>Playing with white stones and clad in black, Luan sits quietly and seriously, contemplating his next move. Wearing a patterned shirt and a Go tie, his partner looks at me and grins.</p>\n<p>“When Rex gets into the game, his face gets red. The redder he is, the better he plays,” Hu says.</p>\n<p>Though small in numbers, UCSB Go Club makes up for it with heart.</p>\n<p>Luan was only six years old when he was first exposed to Go, and for him it was love at first sight. He began spending four hours a week in lessons with a professional player, reviewing games and practicing with fellow students.</p>\n<p>It was this dedication that led the Go Club to victory this April.</p>\n<p>Along with club member Justin Shieh, Hu and Luan made up the team that narrowly defeated the University of Toronto and claimed victory in the final round of the Collegiate Go League.</p>\n<p>Both Shieh and Hu have similar origin stories. Hu was first introduced to Go when he was four. He said an elderly cook at his kindergarten in Beijing was the first to teach him the game, and he then began playing with his father.</p>\n<p>Shieh, who was first exposed to the game in Mandarin school at the age of eight, said he fell into it almost “by accident.” He said he started playing around the age of nine or ten and played seriously for nine years.</p>\n<p>Go originated in ancient China, and, according to the club members, is easy to learn but difficult to master. Although the game may seem simple, with a wooden board and black and white pieces, its appearance is deceiving.</p>\n<p>According to the American Go Association, it is “the most complex of all games.”</p>\n<p>Google recently developed an artificial intelligence system called AlphaGo that was able to beat one of the top ranked Go players. In two weeks, it will take on the highest ranked Go player in the world, Ke Jie.</p>\n<p>Not only has AlphaGo made a splash in the international Go community, but it has also inspired Luan, a computer engineering major, to share his love of the game and continue learning about the mathematics behind it.</p>\n<p>“I want to spread this culture to other places in UCSB and introduce it to more people,” Luan said. “Go itself contains a lot of wisdom. Many people try to break it, break its algorithm … I tried to attempt to break its algorithm, too … but I’m still studying for it.”</p>\n<h6><center><img data-attachment-id=\"77809\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/playful-wisdom-go-club-and-its-quiet-success/howtoplaygo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/howtoplaygo.jpg?fit=999%2C670&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"999,670\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"howtoplaygo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/howtoplaygo.jpg?fit=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/howtoplaygo.jpg?fit=888%2C596&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-77809\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/howtoplaygo.jpg?resize=700%2C469\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"469\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/howtoplaygo.jpg?w=999&amp;ssl=1 999w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/howtoplaygo.jpg?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/howtoplaygo.jpg?resize=768%2C515&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></center></h6>\n<p>Beyond algorithms, Go also inspires passion within the club members.</p>\n<p>Shieh said his demanding work schedule often prevents him from attending meetings and limits his ability to practice, but he still plays with the Go Club because of the team’s friendship.</p>\n<p>For others, the love of the game extends past the fun and competition and relates back to real life.</p>\n<p>“I just think that Go has so many parallels to life; it has many metaphors,” Hu said. “In the global sense, you have to give up something, and this relates to life. You have to give up maybe what’s less important in the moment and just focus on what’s larger. And it hurts to give up things, it really does, but sometimes you have to.”</p>\n<p>This love and fascination with Go manifests through continued practice. Hu plays one game a day, averaging around an hour and a half per game.</p>\n<p>Despite the time commitment and preparation for competition, however, the road to victory was riddled with challenges.</p>\n<p>The team is split into different “boards,” with the strongest player playing the first board. For Hu, this posed significant challenges due to the high skill level of players from other schools.</p>\n<p>When competing against UC Berkeley, Hu said he faced off against a professional player, which proved to be an intimidating task.</p>\n<p>“With Go, there’s no luck; if you lose, that means you have certainly done something wrong,” Hu said. “You just played unfavorably compared to your opponent … I didn’t feel too bad because I was playing a pro, and I don’t spend all day playing this game.”</p>\n<p>“But then again, I really felt during those weeks it was comradery and team spirit that really carried us through,” Hu added, showing the club’s sense of togetherness that has developed through days of practice.</p>\n<p>Described by Hu as a “dark horse,” UCSB’s Go Club was not expected to win the competition. It ranked fifth after the normal season, but after a months-long campaign that began in October, a narrow victory by Shieh clinched their two-to-one victory over University of Toronto.</p>\n<p>“It came down to the last move,” Hu said. “I felt surprisingly calm after that. I wasn’t, like, too ecstatic. The previous night, I thought that if we won this I would like erupt with a cheer, but I didn’t. I guess, at the moment, I just couldn’t take the enormity of that.”</p>\n<p>With Shieh and Luan graduating after this quarter, the future of Go Club remains uncertain. With fewer than 10 members regularly attending meetings, forming a team remains a challenge.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a popular game by any means,” Shieh said.</p>\n<p>Yet poised to take over as president, Hu said he is not worried about the amount of members the team will have in the future or protecting its title.</p>\n<p>“With every club, people graduate, people come and go … including myself,” Hu said. “If we win it next year or have a good result next time, then it’s going to feel good. But the first chance we got is really the most memorable one, and we seized it.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, May 11, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.
