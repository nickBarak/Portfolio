UCSB employees. <em>Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution to do so, written by Off-Campus Senators Dallin Mello and Christian Ornelas, calls upon the University of California to implement a cost-of-living adjustment and increase the current minimum wage. It also directs UC Santa Barbara’s Associated Students (A.S.) to raise its workers’ pay to $15 an hour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are 322 students employed by A.S., and 33 career employees, according to Ornelas. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mello and Ornelas noted in the resolution that the UC had implemented a policy in 2013 that raised the minimum wage for UC employees to $15 in 2013, but that it only applied to those who worked at least 20 hours a week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“…at many UC campuses, students are prohibited from working more than 19 hours per week, thereby systematically preventing them from qualifying for a raise under this policy,” the resolution states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution demands that the $15 minimum wage be applied to all UC workers, regardless of the number of hours that they work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with supporting a systemwide cost-of-living raise, the resolution also directs A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez to work with Student Advocate General Grecia Martinez and President Brooke Kopel to increase wages for students employed by A.S. UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution mandates that yearly A.S. budgets from now onward should account for the increased wages and directs the UC Human Resources department to “perform an upward reclassification” of UCSB employees to ensure that their minimum salary meets the living minimum wage policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Human Resources department declines to do so or does not respond to the resolution within two weeks, the Senate will provide honoraria for A.S. UCSB employees to ensure their final pay amounts to at least $15 an hour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate also plans to pass a resolution stating that “ASUCSB has no confidence with University of California’s ability to fairly treat ASUCSB employees” if Human Resources does not accommodate the requests.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators discussed where the funding would come from during Wednesday evening’s meeting, clarifying that student fees would not be raised in order to increase A.S. UCSB wages. Instead, funds within the current budget would be reallocated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though several senators argued that it would be unfair to prioritize A.S. UCSB workers with this raise when many students have other on-campus jobs or work in I.V., Ornelas referred to this motion as a “stepping stone” with the hope of setting the tone for other organizations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Instead of waiting for [the university] to do something… we should start and let them follow us with everything that we do,” On-Campus Senator Zion Solomon added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon was the only one to abstain from the vote, stating they strongly supported the resolution but could not vote due to a conflict of interest because they worked at the A.S. Ticket Office.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Ornelas clarified that there are 322 student employees working for Associated Students. The article previously said there were 282. </em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi is an asst. news editor at the </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and can be reached at </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">skamidi@dailynexus.com</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">news@dailynexus.com</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>.</em> </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

We make mistakes and we own up to them. We issue corrections when needed and we are open, time and time again, as to how our reporting process works.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> has a duty to the student body to keep them informed of relevant issues in their community. We also do our best as student journalists to hold elected officials accountable.</p>\n<p>We feel the need to write this editorial because the Associated Students (A.S.) 69th Senate is not doing that for themselves.</p>\n<p>The Senate has a duty to the student body to represent students’ issues, one they have not maintained since taking office.</p>\n<p>In the <em>Nexus’</em> point of view – as individuals who extensively cover Senate’s resolutions, meetings and more – the 69th Senate consistently fails to represent our student body and is, in no way, accountable to the people they were elected to serve.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate is a group of 24 students who decide how millions of dollars of our student fees are spent. The senators are paid $350 a quarter in honorarium and are required to fulfill specific duties, such as holding office hours.</p>\n<p>However, A.S. Senate as a whole lacks transparency. Below are a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Senate did not have a public list of their office hours until the <em>Nexus</em> requested it during Week 6. The 2018-2019 A.S. Legal Code mandates this list be “scheduled and publicly posted by the end of the third (3rd) week of each quarter.”</li>\n<li>They use Facebook to communicate Senate-related announcements to their constituents, despite the fact that you need to have a Facebook account and be Facebook friends with them to see anything remotely related to their positions.</li>\n<li>They did not establish a Senate bill database until after the <em>Nexus</em> created one last year in order to make every resolution easily accessible to the senators’ constituents.</li>\n<li>They demanded The Bottom Line (TBL) turn off a livestream at the end of a public Senate meeting, which TBL – and the <em>Nexus</em> – had every right to record.</li>\n<li>Their website is still not updated with the names and office hours of this year’s senators, even though it is the end of Week 7.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Senators are not holding themselves accountable; instead, they consistently act unprofessionally as elected officials who control millions of dollars in student fees.</p>\n<p>We do want to acknowledge the valuable work some senators have been doing. For example, Senator Zion Solomon has worked to compile finance reports that detail the amount of money allocated to organizations during Finance and Business Committee meetings.</p>\n<p>To our knowledge, the finance reports are only posted on Facebook, but Senator Solomon’s efforts show a commitment to transparency.</p>\n<p>Senators do good things. We’re not saying they don’t. However, many of them have not been doing the jobs they have been elected to do.</p>\n<p>Even the leader of Senate – Internal Vice President (IVP) Steven Ho, whose pay amounts to $3,000 a quarter – fails to take his job seriously.</p>\n<p>His job is to hold his senators accountable, to keep some semblance of decorum during Senate meetings and to ensure senators follow Legal Code.</p>\n<p>Despite this, Ho fails to show professionalism, even during Senate meetings. Ho, as the IVP, sets the tone for how senators should conduct themselves during meetings.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday’s Senate meeting, Ho <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/46381421_335573963663022_3500040927651561472_n.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1279546202\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"84956\">retweeted</a> a tweet from Senate minute-taker Isabella Liu, which stated “someone get me out of this meeting please.” Ho replied to the tweet at 7:26 p.m. with “someone save us please.”</p>\n<p>Later during that same meeting, Ho <a href=\"http://46498938_2203294369732002_1446147155357073408_n.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1131452933\" data-slb-group=\"84956\">tweeted</a> “this meeting has been going on in circles, I wish I could get a proxy.”</p>\n<p>Both Twitter accounts are public.</p>\n<p>What senators – and Ho – seem to forget is that representing our student body is a privilege, one that they have been given by the students.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday’s Senate meeting, a UCSB alumnus stood up at public forum, identifying themselves as a “concerned Gaucho.”</p>\n<p>“I’m here to tell you one simple sentence, and I’m not taking any questions, but I recently realized that the <em>Daily Nexus</em> is really good for toilet paper and I want to recommend it to all of you. It’s really good to wipe your ass with,” the individual said.</p>\n<p>“It’s really just trash, garbage newspaper so please use it to wipe your butthole with whenever you’re taking a shit, that’s my recommendation.”</p>\n<p>His words are what spurred this editorial, but they are not the focus of it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">What senators – and Ho – seem to forget is that representing our student body is a privilege, one that they have been given by the students.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Instead, we would like to call attention to the way the senators and proxies, as well as Ho, responded to this individual.</p>\n<p>In response to this individual’s words, senators and proxies laughed and clapped their hands over their mouths. One even bowed toward the podium as the individual walked away.</p>\n<p>Ho could be seen recording the individual and laughing. The video <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9540.TRIM_.mov\">was posted</a> on Ho’s Snapchat story with the caption “I have no words 4 dis.”</p>\n<p>The comments from “concerned Gaucho” were not said in order to provide constructive dialogue or a call to action. Rather, they were blatantly inflammatory and used to reap attention.</p>\n<p>A few members of A.S. spoke with the <em>Nexus</em> following these remarks, condemning the sentiments. Yet no one publicly addressed the individual’s comments for the rest of the meeting.</p>\n<p>Senators are not required to defend the <em>Nexus</em>, but there are standards they must adhere to.</p>\n<p>According to their own 2018-2019 A.S. Legal Code, members of A.S. must “treat each other and those in the community with behavior that fosters a safe, inclusive environment for everyone. This behavior includes but is not limited to: professionalism, compassion, courtesy, civility, and respect.”</p>\n<p>We would have hoped senators would have acted in accordance to their Legal Code, as their response to “concerned Gaucho”’s remarks was not professional, compassionate, courteous, civil or respectful.</p>\n<p>Instead, our paid, elected officials laughed at the hateful comments.</p>\n<p>They did not keep composure – they joined in on the joke.</p>\n<p>This is a student government, and we are a student newspaper. To the world outside our university, it is easy to dismiss our student government’s actions as an inconsequential side effect of decisions made by 18 to 22-year-olds.</p>\n<p>However, these people are our future “real-world” leaders. From what we have observed so far, there is a dangerous precedent in motion.</p>\n<p>Maybe we’re asking for too much. But we certainly hope that’s not the case.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84956\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-16/editorial-a-demand-for-standards-re-a-s-senate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84956\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-16/editorial-a-demand-for-standards-re-a-s-senate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-16/editorial-a-demand-for-standards-re-a-s-senate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-16/editorial-a-demand-for-standards-re-a-s-senate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-16/editorial-a-demand-for-standards-re-a-s-senate/","id":2168,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2167,2166,2165],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UC C.A.R.E.

UCSB’s chapter is led by Conway, who has been working with the program since 2014.</p>\n<p>The meetings took place at UC Davis and spanned from Dec. 10 to Dec. 12. Those in attendance also included UC Interim Systemwide Title IX Coordinator Suzanne Taylor and Vice President for Student Affairs Robin Holmes Sullivan.</p>\n<p>The directors typically hold biannual meetings to discuss a multitude of issues related to sexual assault and violence, Conway said. At last week’s meeting, their primary concern was the Department of Education’s recent proposed Title IX changes.</p>\n<p>Among various modifications, the changes propose narrowing the definition of sexual assault under Title IX and allowing for the cross-examination of accusers and respondents in live courtroom hearings.</p>\n<p>The C.A.R.E. directors discussed how these changes would disrupt the UC’s current “single-investigator model” by allowing for the cross-examination of accusers and respondents in live hearings.</p>\n<p>Currently, the UC’s model uses a “neutral-fact finding” investigator to determine whether there is enough evidence to constitute a violation of Title IX policy. The amendments would change this by shifting disputes to traditional courtroom settings, opening the possibility of power imbalances, according to Conway.</p>\n<p>“It’s becoming much more of a legalized process that can feel really intimidating to someone in trauma. Obviously some parties choose to have lawyers involved, so there’s an imbalance in power there if one party has a lawyer and the other doesn’t,” she said.</p>\n<p>Other concerns related to this amendment includes the financial ability of students to pay for legal services often needed to pursue a case in court, Conway said.</p>\n<p>Conway feels that shifting to the courtroom model would create unnecessarily difficult hurdles for survivors as well as alleged perpetrators.</p>\n<p>“Having to put a survivor in the same room as their perpetrator is barbaric, but that’s not to say that the student who is defending their academic future isn’t also in a stressful situation,” Conway said.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“I think the burden would fall on either the UC or our campus to integrate how what happens in Isla Vista is tied to the educational experience of the students.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, the C.A.R.E. directors considered how schools would no longer be required to investigate off-campus allegations, which could leave a large number of incidents in neighboring communities ignored, according to Conway.</p>\n<p>She feels that especially with UCSB and Isla Vista, survivors’ experiences would be severely neglected.</p>\n<p>Conway hopes that whatever transpires with the proposed changes, UC administrators will be able to maintain protections of their students under the law. However, she said it might be up to the UC system to decide how to proceed with pursuing off-campus cases in the future.</p>\n<p>“I think the burden would fall on either the UC or our campus to integrate how what happens in Isla Vista is tied to the educational experience of the students.”</p>\n<p>C.A.R.E. directors also discussed controversies over the amount of evidence required for Title IX convictions.</p>\n<p>Currently, the “preponderance of evidence” standard requires that institutions follow the lowest standard of evidence when deciding if students have violated Title IX. This standard was set forth by the Obama administration, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/us/devos-colleges-sex-assault.html\">New York Times.</a></p>\n<p>With the changes, the Department of Education would instead let schools decide which standard to follow, whether it be “preponderance of the evidence” or a higher standard of “clear and convincing evidence,” as the <a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/title-ix-nprm.pdf\">department’s report</a> stated.</p>\n<p>According to the report, some cases carry “particularly grave consequences for a respondent’s reputation and ability to pursue a professional career,” which might warrant a higher standard of proof.</p>\n<p>Whether it be “preponderance of evidence” or “clear and convincing evidence,” institutions would be required to use the same standard for students and faculty members, the report said.</p>\n<p>Conway agrees that regardless of the accepted standard, it is most important for institutions use the same guidelines for employees and students alike.</p>\n<p>“When we treat populations with different standards of evidence … it almost creates a system of power and privilege,” Conway said.</p>\n<p>In light of the proposed amendments, C.A.R.E. directors also talked about how schools can provide resources.</p>\n<p>“If the federal government is going to start narrowing down the help that we can provide survivors in the administrative process, we as an institution need to respond to broader, better arms to help care for the human being,” she said.</p>\n<p>This includes ensuring that “responsible employees” respond adequately to reports of sexual assault and are trained to provide resources for students and connect them to programs like C.A.R.E. It also includes communicating students’ rights to survivors and helping them through processes like law enforcement and civil reporting.</p>\n<p>Taylor and UC President Janet Napolitano, who recently wrote a <a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-troubled-proposed-changes-sexual-harassment-rules\">press release</a> and an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/janet-napolitano-dont-let-the-trump-administration-undermine-title-ix/2018/12/04/6c91f316-f7fc-11e8-863c-9e2f864d47e7_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.14e3cbe04ab6\">op-ed</a> about this issue respectively, will factor C.A.R.E.’s discussion into the official UC opinion on the Title IX changes, Conway said.</p>\n<p>The Department of Education has allowed for a 60-day period of public comment following the proposed changes.
