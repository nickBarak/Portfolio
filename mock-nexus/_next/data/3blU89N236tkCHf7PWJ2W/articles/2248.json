Gessesse</em></p></div>\n<p>The North Hall Takeover of 1968 led to the creation of the Black Studies department, which now offers a diverse set of courses encompassing traditional subjects like the history of black Americans as well as more specialized courses detailing Caribbean studies, the black radical tradition and the history of jazz music.</p>\n<p>Professor Jeffrey Stewart, who works in the department and helped organize the North Hall Takeover: 50 Years After conference that took place at UC Santa Barbara earlier this month, is proud of the growth the department has seen since its creation.</p>\n<p>“We feel that our very existence here is due to their vision and their activism, so we try to honor that with these anniversary celebrations,” Stewart said.</p>\n<p>The creation of the Black Studies department also set the groundwork for other departments such as the Chicanx Studies department, the Feminist Studies department and the Asian American Studies department.</p>\n<p>“There’s a body of knowledge that’s come out of the black experience of America that all students can benefit from and there’s a body of knowledge that’s come out of the Chicano experience of America that can be useful for all students,” Stewart said.</p>\n<p>Stewart cites a “critical apparatus” and activism as the two leading tenets of the Black Studies department.</p>\n<p>Not only does the department teach its students to be critical consumers of the information presented to them, but it also emphasizes the need for activism and the role it’s played in creating the America we live in today, he said.</p>\n<p>“Activism sometimes is looked down on in the larger political landscape but I think if you look at change in America, much of it has come about because people have been activists,” he said.</p>\n<p>Despite its growth, the department is currently struggling with a shortage of professors.</p>\n<p>While Stewart said the problem is mostly temporary due to professors who have passed away or recently left, he said the larger problem is the lack of attention to the humanities as a whole.</p>\n<p>“The university is internationally known for its science and engineering, so that’s kind of what they’re always emphasizing,” said Stewart said.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to interdisciplinary departments like black studies, feminist studies… sometimes it’s a struggle to get administrators to see that part of the education here is not just getting technical education, it’s education to become a citizen, and to be a globally aware citizen.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has a long history of activism, particularly within the Black Student Union (BSU).</p>\n<p>BSU students are currently working to update the demands from 2012 and cite their two biggest concerns as the resources available for black educators and the “recruitment and retention of black students,” according to BSU Chair Mariyah Lewis.</p>\n<p>“Seeing how the office engages with the retention and recruitment of black students… is one of the indicative efforts of how strong and how serious the demands are, ranging from 1968 all the way to 2012,” said Alexandra Gessesse, whose position in the Office of Admissions as diversity intern was a direct result of previous BSU demands.</p>\n<p>Dalton Nezey, one of the original members of the North Hall Takeover, echoed similar sentiments in establishing strong, consistent professors in the Black Studies department.</p>\n<p>“I wanted [the professors] to be caretakers of the history of black studies and the history of blacks on this campus,” Nezey said.</p>\n<p>Samantha Sanchez, who is leading the seven-member BSU demands team, says most of the demands have received money allocated toward their completion.</p>\n<p>The team is now responsible for making sure the money is used correctly.</p>\n<p>The demands are constantly evolving, as the needs of black students at UCSB evolve, and Sanchez says the main goal of the demands team is to “assess the state of the black community on campus.”</p>\n<p>“What we have left right now is just to ensure the overall well-being of black students and black people on campus,” she added.</p>\n<p>The addition of two black psychologists in Counseling and Psychological Services and the creation of the diversity intern position in the Admissions Office are two of the demands from 2012 that have already been met.</p>\n<p>There are still many demands left incomplete, however, including one asking for a display in North Hall memorializing the North Hall Takeover and a database of contact information for black students to allow for faculty or BSU leaders to “extend resources to our community more systematically and rigorously,” according to the 2012 demands.</p>\n<p>“I think that the things that we’re implementing will allow for us to see change happen in a very institutional and lasting way,” Sanchez said. “I’m excited to see where it goes after I graduate.”</p>\n<p><i>A

During the investigation, Martinez’s charges were listed among the search results. The <em>Nexus </em>then obtained police arrest records for the charges in question.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara Police Department (UCPD) officers first arrested Martinez on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive in Isla Vista at approximately 11:40 a.m. on Feb. 14, according to arrest records. Martinez was charged with inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant.</p>\n<p>She was booked in the Santa Barbara Jail on $25,000 bail and was released around 1 a.m. on Feb. 15, according to arrest records.</p>\n<p>Martinez pleaded not guilty. A settlement conference will be held in September, according to Santa Barbara trial court records. Martinez is being tried as a defendant against the People of the State of California.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.occourts.org/self-help/restrainingorders/criminalrestrainingorders.html\">criminal protective order</a>, which requires a “restrained person” not to “hurt, threaten, or communicate with the other person,” was filed on March 14, according to court records.</p>\n<p>In a separate incident, California Highway Patrol (CHP) stopped Martinez on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive in I.V. on March 1 at approximately 1:50 a.m. on charges of driving under the influence with a blood alcohol percent of over 0.08 percent, according to arrest records.</p>\n<p>Martinez is also being charged with possession of a controlled substance, according to court records.

Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Kopel selected Justin Nilsen, former solicitor general for the attorney general’s office, to fill the position of chairman.</p>\n<p>The Judicial Council is made up of one chairman, four members and one advisor, the latter of who does not vote on decisions, according to its website.</p>\n<p>At the end of last year, two of the three members, Matthew Lanthier and Roshni Sopariwalla, graduated, leaving Raymond Alonso, a current second-year political science and history of public policy major, as the only member on the council.</p>\n<p>Currently, the council has one active petition and one order of business to address relating to the position of EVPSA as well as allegations of campaign violations committed by Campus United (CU) that could disqualify all CU senators as well as Kopel.</p>\n<p>At the Senate meeting Wednesday night, Kopel said she had been holding off on appointing students to the council for several reasons. For one, she is charged with filling four seats for positions that students hold until they graduate.</p>\n<p>“Once you’re on, you’re making decisions for potentially four years, and that’s why I don’t take it lightly,” Kopel said. “That’s why I want to make sure that since I’ve been in the random situation that four new seats have opened when I’ve become president, I want to make sure that the best people and the fairest people are appointed, and that comes with time.”</p>\n<p>She also stated that of previous applicants, none of the students she reached out to had responded, leaving her no choice but to start up another round of applications during the summer.</p>\n<p>Currently the Committee on Committees (COC) is reviewing the applications. Once they conduct interviews they will make their recommendations to Kopel, who plans on conducting her own set of interviews as well.</p>\n<p>As for Nilsen, Kopel said she has known him since his freshman year through their involvement with mock trial.</p>\n<p>“I worked with him a lot, and saw how smart that dang kid is,” she said. “Really the drive he has for advocacy, and just judiciary in general, and so when he expressed interest to me in being on judicial council, I really considered him, knowing already what I knew about him and also looking at his answers to the questions that everybody else filled out.”</p>\n<p>Kopel stressed the importance of filling up the Judicial Council so that any open cases could be properly addressed.</p>\n<p>At the Senate meeting, Letters and Science Senator Ricardo Uribe requested that the Senate be allowed to question Kopel’s appointments before approving them, referencing the fact that Nilsen was unable to be present at the meeting.</p>\n<p>After moving the item into discussion, senators debated the merits of questioning the presidential appointments, a practice Kopel said was historically unprecedented.</p>\n<p>Marisela Marquez, Associated Students (A.S.) executive director, said that while in recent history, presidential appointments have not been scrutinized as heavily, there has been a past of senators questioning the selections.</p>\n<p>As Senate moved into discussion regarding Nilsen’s appointment, many agreed that they would like the opportunity to get to know him before making decisions that would affect their constituents.</p>\n<p>“I really want to respect Brooke and her appointments, [but] we should be able to ask questions…we should just be 100% confident that they will be able to do their job, nonbiased,” said Senator Christian Ornelas. “I just think it would be irresponsible not to ask questions.”</p>\n<p>As they took their vote to table the appointment until they would be able to question Nilsen, Proxy Rose Ettleson asked the Senate to commit themselves to the same process for future candidates.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
