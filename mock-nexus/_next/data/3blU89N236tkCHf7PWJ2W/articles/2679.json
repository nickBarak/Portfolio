Senate, reforming Science, Technology, Aerospace and Research Kapital (S.T.A.R.K.) funding and to vote on the five bills presented at last week’s meeting.</p>\n<p>The S.T.A.R.K. bill, approved in January 2013, sets aside $10,000 to be used by science and engineering student organizations on large-scale projects, in addition to their own fundraising efforts. Assistant Director of Technology Sean Lieberman, Residence Hall Association (RHA) President Matilda Mead and second-year political science major On-campus Senator Jose Magaña presented to senate during public forum.</p>\n<p>At last week’s senate meeting, On-campus Senator and second-year economics and political science double major Nawar Nemeh presented “A Bill to Switch Associated Students Elections to a Single Transferable Vote System.”</p>\n<p>Lieberman said implementing single transferable voting, in which voters would rank each candidate, would require adapting the online voting system. According to Lieberman, UC Berkeley currently utilizes a single transferable voting system and produces election results in three to seven days, while UCSB tabulates votes within three hours.</p>\n<p>“I would call [single transferable voting] low voter patience. We’ve never asked people to rank 30 candidates in past elections,” Lieberman said. “In order to explain what effect the complex nature of single transferable voting will have on counting the votes, I read Berkeley’s elections code regarding tallying. They give three to seven days — three is the minimum — to seven days and we usually get it [the results] out in three hours.”</p>\n<p>Mead said she is working to establish RHA liaisons in A.S Senate and Committee meetings, and productivity could increase if A.S. and RHA worked together.</p>\n<p>“I’ve decided to shift the RHA’s focus to putting a greater focus on advocacy and initiative,” Mead said. “Our residents are affected the same way your students are affected.”</p>\n<p>Mead also said there may be concerns of potentially conflicting interests between students and Housing &amp; Residential Services (HRS) if RHA were to work with A.S Senate and Committees, but the benefits outweigh the potential costs.</p>\n<p>“I completely agree that some committees are not suitable for RHA members to sit on,” Mead said. “Luckily, there are many other committees that are, and all of these committees that potentially benefit from having a member the residence halls report to and from [RHA] organization.”</p>\n<p>Magaña said he hopes to increase the impact RHA has on A.S and expand the responsibilities of floor representatives, which he believes will improve student body representation.</p>\n<p>“I will send bills and resolutions that they can look over because I believe in direct representation from my constituents,” Magaña said. “We represent RHA here, but RHA has its own committee so they have a direct representation of people in the residence hall.”</p>\n<p>According to Magaña, floor representatives are willing to increase their responsibilities once they are more involved in A.S.</p>\n<p>“I’ve talked to past floor reps about retention,” Magaña said. “Some of their concerns is not necessarily about hour commitment but because they feel like they didn’t have much say even though their position is immensely important.”</p>\n<p>Magaña then presented “A Resolution to Create an Ad-Hoc Committee to Fill the Vacant On-Campus Senate Position.”</p>\n<p>College of Creative Studies (CCS) Collegiate Senator and third-year biochemistry and chemistry major Dustin Larrazolo presented bills on forming an A.S. Student Councils and establishing funds.</p>\n<p>Larrazolo presented “A Bill to Establish A.S. Student Councils” which outlines a plan to provide a legislative outlet for CCS and College of Engineering (CoE) students to voice their opinions.</p>\n<p>“The CCS student council held their first forum and got 40 attendees,” Larrazolo said. “[CCS and CoE] will be able to get a lot more resources that they do not have and also be more connected with A.S.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo then presented “A Bill to Redefine S.T.A.R.K. funds” and “A Bill to Establish the Creative, Artistic, Research, and Diversity Fund,” which outlines two A.S funds to support students’ academic projects and research.</p>\n<p>Senate moved seven new bills and five old bills from last week to the Campus Affairs committee.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65140\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/a-s-senate-meets-to-discuss-rha-representatives-in-senate-s-t-a-r-k-funding/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65140\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/a-s-senate-meets-to-discuss-rha-representatives-in-senate-s-t-a-r-k-funding/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/a-s-senate-meets-to-discuss-rha-representatives-in-senate-s-t-a-r-k-funding/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/a-s-senate-meets-to-discuss-rha-representatives-in-senate-s-t-a-r-k-funding/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/a-s-senate-meets-to-discuss-rha-representatives-in-senate-s-t-a-r-k-funding/","id":2679,"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez"},"related":[2678,2677,2676],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez","biography":"Not available","articles":[2516,2571,2611,2670,2679,2694,3939,3962,3971,3974,3975,3976,3977],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Monologues Shed Light on UCSB LGBTQ Community","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Resource Center for Sexual & Gender Diversity (RCSGD) hosted “Coming Out Monologues” Monday evening in the Hub to celebrate LGBTQ History Month and National Coming Out Day, which takes place O...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity (RCSGD) hosted “Coming Out Monologues” Monday evening in the Hub to celebrate LGBTQ History Month and National Coming Out Day, which takes place Oct. 11.</p>\n<p>Students of varying genders and sexual identities attended the event to recount stories of discovering and revealing their identity. Speakers shared their experiences coming out during the initial portion of the event, followed by an open mic for attendees to share their own stories.</p>\n<p>Third-year history major William Roberts said the event communicated the “diversity of experiences” people have when coming out.</p>\n<p>“Revealing [coming out] as not to be the one-time event … but as a complex, sometimes difficult, but ultimately beautiful and liberating experience felt differently by all queer and trans people,” Roberts said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year communication major Jean Mack, whose name has been changed, said she has a “split lifestyle” because she has not come out as bisexual in her hometown in Northern California but is involved with many LGBTQ events at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“It’s very freeing to be in a community where you can be your whole self,” Mack said. “I think for many people, especially coming in as freshmen, it’s their first experience where they can be around queer people.”</p>\n<p>Mack said she was comfortable speaking at the “Coming Out Monologues” because organizers reached out to a wide range of identities when advertising the event.</p>\n<p>“I think a very subtle thing … which I hope they continue doing, is putting all sorts of identities on the poster itself for the event,” Mack said. “[It] was a big deal for me because, as a bisexual woman, I often feel like I’m not straight enough for straight places and I’m not queer enough for gay spaces so it’s this weird in-between.”</p>\n<p>Second-year chemistry major Shelley Alvarez, whose name and year have been changed, said being queer at UCSB is “a lot less alienating” than she expected, but finding spaces for everyday interactions is still difficult.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the settings in which people congregate to are very sexual in nature, or they involve a lot of drinking and hook-ups and sometimes you just want to find a group of people to hang out with and have fun with,” Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>According to RCGSD Graduate Assistant and Ph.D. candidate Alex Kulick, LGBTQ communities and resources on campus and in I.V. need to be made more apparent to students.</p>\n<p>“I think one of the big issues that I’ve noticed really is a lack of visibility,” Kulick said. “There’s certainly a lot of spaces, especially in Isla Vista, that are not necessarily visibly queer or don’t have any visible presence of queer-friendly spaces.”</p>\n<p>Kulick said it was his first time attending the “Coming Out Monologues.”</p>\n<p>“I was just really, really impressed by the courage of the students and the vulnerability that they were able to share, and also, I think the diversity of the experiences that were showcased along different lines of gender, race, ethnicity, class and, of course, all types of different other experiences that people come from.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The committee fully granted six requests, partially granted six requests and tabled two requests.</p>\n<p>Delta Sigma Pi requested $656 for a campus event and $2,300 to send five members to the Leadership and Excellence Academies for Deltasigs in New Mexico.</p>\n<p>Delta Sigma Pi member Austin Kang said the group’s first request was for an Oct. 23 event to educate UCSB students about the nonprofit organization Liberty in North Korea, which helps North Koreans escape to other countries.</p>\n<p>“We are hopeful that [this event] will bring awareness about the condition and the situations that people in North Korea live in,” Kang said. “There is going to be at least one refugee that will speak.”</p>\n<p>The committee fully funded the group $656 but tabled its request for $2,300 to the Oct. 12 meeting.</p>\n<p>KCSB representative Matt Merritt requested $2,000 for Hello World!, a music festival on Oct. 10 in Anisq’Oyo’ Park that will feature Scientist, The Lions and Cornerstone.</p>\n<p>“We are bringing these groups, musical groups, from all around the world to come and perform,” Merritt said. “We are educating the community on these groups and their cultures. And then also educational in the sense that we are bringing members of our own community in one place to appreciate and discover each other’s culture.”</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund KCSB.</p>\n<p>UCSB League of Legends (L.o.L.) treasurer Elaine Hu and public relations chair Albert Chen requested $80 for a gaming event Oct. 11at the Loma Pelona Center.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund UCSB L.o.L.</p>\n<p>Swing and Ballroom Dance Club co-treasurer Cecilia Gutierrez and president Steve Carlan requested $2,594 for a free swing dance event Oct. 24 in the Student Resource Building.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fund the club $1,460 for a band, refreshments and Community Service Officers (CSO’s) at the event.</p>\n<p>Cotillion Dance Club treasurer Alex Vera and vice president Samuel Anspach requested $2,921 for the club’s annual dance competition, Beach Ball.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fund the club $2,120 to hire professional dancers for the event.</p>\n<p>Transfer Student Alliance requested for $426 for their first general meeting on Oct. 14 in the Student Resource Building.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund the group for its upcoming event.</p>\n<p>On-campus senator and second-year political science major José Magaña requested $2,474 from senate unallocated funds for condom dispensers to place in bathrooms around campus.</p>\n<p>CCS Collegiate Senator and third-year CCS chemistry and biochemistry major Dustin Larrazolo said the committee should fund Magaña’s project, because it fully granted KCSB’s request.</p>\n<p>“Safe sex is more important than a broadcasting radio station’s event,” Larrazolo said.</p>\n<p>Kevin Koo recommended Magaña request funds through a campus organization in order to access OSL funds as opposed to senate unallocated.</p>\n<p>“He is working with other student groups and OSL groups,” Koo said. “He could just come in next week.”</p>\n<p>The committee voted to table Magaña’s request until its Oct. 12 meeting, suggesting he seek other funding options throughout the week.</p>\n<p>A.S.

The demonstration was successful in gaining cooperation from UCSB administrators. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Five months after students gathered for a 13-hour sit-in at Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s office to present 13 demands regarding campus sexual assault policy, administrators are continuing to collaborate with students on various improvements to support survivors and punish perpetrators.</p>\n<p>The May sit-in led by student group #NowUCSB, formerly “It’s Not On Us, It’s On You,” resulted in Yang agreeing to consider a list of 13 demands, including stricter punishments for offenders, improved sensitivity training for faculty and staff and greater diversity among on-campus aid groups and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP). The farthest-reaching policy change from the demands is a UC-wide requirement in June for all faculty and staff to undergo sexual violence and consent training. Other changes include increased sexual assault training for IVFP deputies and advertising for the Sexual Assault Survivor Fund on campus, which provides financial support to survivors to cover immediate expenses.</p>\n<p>#NowUCSB leader and third-year Chican@ studies major Alejandra Melgoza said while an estimated 95 percent of the demands are in progress, the bureaucracy involved with certain demands has caused delayed implementation.</p>\n<p>“So many survivors for so many years have been waiting for these changes to happen, and, right now, we have policy demands that we have to make happen,” Melgoza said. “Because of all the red tape we have to go through, it will take a long time.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said while the support of students and staff pressured the administration to make changes, ongoing education is still necessary to the movement’s success.</p>\n<p>“I have been very grateful for the support from Associated Students, faculty, staff, grad students and workers across the campus,” Melgoza said. “It has made an impact, and people are aware of it, but it’s very important to highlight to the new incoming class. They need to know what happened last year so that they can support it.”</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming said with the start of the new academic year, more students will become involved in the campaign.</p>\n<p>“There has been progress on many of the thirteen demands, though we have been waiting for students to return to get their feedback and involvement in several of the demand areas,” Fleming said in an email. “I am hoping to see a diverse group of students established with whom staff and administrators can meet on a regular, perhaps monthly, basis to discuss issues of sexual and interpersonal violence.”</p>\n<p>#NowUCSB’s first three demands, which request students found guilty of sexual assault be immediately suspended for a minimum of four quarters and removed from campus, have to be approved by UC Office of the President. According to Fleming, the President’s Task Force on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Violence and Sexual Assault will soon release updated UC-wide policies.</p>\n<p>“There is a system-wide committee that is part of President Napolitano’s Taskforce on Sexual Violence and Sexual Assault that is about to issue new UC adjudication and sanctioning guidelines, so the Office of Judicial Affairs is waiting for these guidelines to inform any changes related to adjudication of sexual assault cases and disciplinary sanctions,” Fleming said in an email.</p>\n<p>UConsent coordinator, Take Back the Night co-chair and fourth-year global and feminist studies double-major Ashley Morgan said the University is “dragging their feet” in addressing students’ demands for improved sexual assault policies.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think anyone is surprised that the university has delayed putting the demands into effect, given their history of handling cases of sexual assault and their initial resistance to these ideas,” Morgan said in an email.</p>\n<p>Morgan said she is hopeful the demands will soon be implemented.</p>\n<p>“I think [administrators] are beginning to realize that by helping this forward, they are paving the way for the UCs in terms of sexual assault reform,” Morgan said in an email. “I’m hoping that this notion, along with constant pressure from those involved, will get these demands implemented within this school year.”<br>\nAccording to Melgoza, there is still a long way to go before survivors of sexual assault receive sufficient support from the University.</p>\n<p>“These are the lives of students; their power was taken away,” Melgoza said. “It’s important to acknowledge that fact and make sure those survivors are given that power again.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, October 8, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
