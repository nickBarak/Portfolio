The heavily international roster creates a dynamic that most other collegiate programs are never exposed to.</p>\n<p>When high school seniors commit their futures to college programs, they look for places that promote a preferred style of play or mentality, and it seems that Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg has fostered an environment that looks extremely appealing to kids from overseas. Six of the nine freshmen on the current Gaucho roster joined from a range of nations outside the United States.</p>\n<p>Just this week, four of the first-year internationals were listed to the TopDrawerSoccers.com midseason Top-200 Freshman list. Midfielder Daniel Amo (Ghana), fullback Mateo Restrepo Mejia (Canada), winger Noah Billingsley (New Zealand) and goalkeeper Titouan Le Roux (France) are the quartet of top prospects. Amo is the highest ranked at No. 20 on the list and the other three all have experience in the youth setups of their respective national teams.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<div id=\"attachment_73428\" style=\"width: 420px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73428\" data-attachment-id=\"73428\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-21/settling-in-gaucho-freshman-class-solidifies-international-flair/titouan-le-roux-clears-the-ball-eric-swenson-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/10-22-MSoccer-SLO-EricSwensonNexus-3-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1602&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1602\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Titouan Le Roux clears the ball.

Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Apart from Amo, who suffered a groin injury early in the season that has kept him out for four weeks, the other three have locked down spots in Vom Steeg’s main starting nine, quickly adapting to life in Santa Barbara on and off the pitch.</p>\n<p>Le Roux and Mejia have been crucial staples in a shifting defense, with the keeper having started every match without sitting out a minute all year. Mejia has started five matches, but has appeared in every game, serving in countless crosses in his wing-back role.</p>\n<p>“When I came here it was with the objective of playing, so I was ready to play and ready to do everything,” Le Roux said. “It’s my job to play, so I’m glad to be the starting goalkeeper, and I want to keep playing so I keep trying to do my best to keep playing.”</p>\n<p>Billingsley, who played at the U-20s World Cup two years ago for the New Zealand side, has become a key piece of UCSB’s marauding attack, with two goals and two assists.<br>\nTo the credit of his growth over the year, the winger’s dribbling and passing behind striker Nick DePuy has been increasingly noticeable as the year goes on as he grows into his starting role.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73431\" style=\"width: 569px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73431\" data-attachment-id=\"73431\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-21/settling-in-gaucho-freshman-class-solidifies-international-flair/dustin-harris-daily-nexus-10/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-73431\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web-1024x683.jpg?resize=559%2C374\" alt=\"Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus\" width=\"559\" height=\"374\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-73431\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Amo’s injury forced him to endure a testing month of recovery as the promising midfielder eagerly worked his way back into training. His rehab has almost paid its dividends as he prepares to make a brief cameo in Saturday’s home leg of the Blue-Green rivalry.</p>\n<p>“It was frustrating and it hurts, but, I mean, it’s part of the game. But my teammates were right there, very supportive, so I never thought ‘I’m done,’” Amo said. ”They were always there reminding me, like, ‘Oh, you gotta go to rehab.’ The guys were all supportive, so it made it — I wouldn’t say okay because it’s still an injury — but they made it comfortable to be around and go to the games.”</p>\n<p>In his time out, the Accra, Ghana native credited the team’s welcoming and supportive team spirit with helping him through the recovery process. One teammate Amo thanked specifically was senior midfielder Seo-In Kim, who was recovering from a long-term injury alongside him.</p>\n<p>The two spent hours in the gym together fighting back to full strength, and now that both players are back in the rotation, Amo and Kim will get to play together for the first time at some point during the last few games of conference play.</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing to see Seo get ready to play because when I got here I didn’t get to see him play, so I wanted to see him play,” Amo said. “He had a lot of sessions with me and I was like, ‘Oh my god, I want to see Seo play.’ This weekend at Cal Poly we were just knocking the ball around and it made me so excited to have him on the field.”</p>\n<p>The relationship between the Ghanaian and Kim, a midfielder born in South Korea before moving to the States, goes to show how UCSB’s soccer program has become a place for multicultural interaction with one of the most diverse squads in the country.</p>\n<p>It’s become a place where student-athletes from every possible background get to collaborate, and Billingsley commented on how joining up with players from so many cultures even shows in the way the Gauchos play.</p>\n<p>“Almost half of our team are from other places in the world, so everyone gets along and there’s no cliques, which is nice,” Billingsley explained. “Everyone is used to a different style of play and comes from different backgrounds, and I think the chemistry is just right, and that alone has won us a couple of games.”</p>\n<p>Vom Steeg’s style of play, a high-pressing 4-3-3 with attacking wing backs, has allowed the German midfielder Kevin Feucht to shine this season — the junior leads the Big West with 10 goals — as the focal point of the Gauchos’ exciting offense that allows the creative players to express themselves.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With the influence of already having upperclassmen foreign players on the team helping the younger guys adapt to the new pressures of college life and finding resources on campus, it’s clear how much these international athletes stick together.</p>\n<p>Le Roux mentioned the helpfulness of his teammates as he struggled with people “speaking too quick for me,” and the assistance extended to basic tasks associated with moving somewhere new.</p>\n<p>“The older guys know about stuff we have to go through, like getting a new phone plan and bank account and that sort of stuff, and then all the other things like being away from home; it’s really nice to have people there whenever I need to talk about something,” Billingsley said.</p>\n<p>The benefits of a multicultural presence extend beyond the lines of the field as players learn about and compare their teammates’ ways of life with one another.</p>\n<p>The Harder Stadium melting pot is a rare occurrence in college sports, and it is a premier example of the intrigue of diversity in soccer.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

of the development program’s most promising prospects. Fontes played two seasons with the San Juan Academy before moving to the Sac Republic Academy, helping his team qualify for the youth playoffs in its inaugural season.</p>\n<p>Vom Steeg has raving reviews of both players, “anticipating that [Fabretti] will be able to contribute assists and goals even as a freshman,” and also believes that Fontes “will really take off when he enters [UCSB’s] program” due to his excellent composure and knowledge of the game.</p>\n<p>In addition to Sac Republic FC product, the Gauchos’ head coach focused heavily on bolstering the team’s defensive depth, adding another four defenders and a goalkeeper. Incoming freshmen Kavian Kashani, a center back, and Rhys Pak, a right back, both played for two of the top academies in California, the Orange County SC and the De Anza Force Academy, respectively. Vom Steeg said he believes both players can become two of the program’s best defenders.</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper Ricardo Montoy will be transferring from Taft College as an incoming junior to bring more competition to the position after allowing just 16 goals in 24 games last season, including 14 clean sheets and a Conference Goalkeeper of the Year award.</p>\n<p>The final California-recruited defender is Giovanny Acosta — who won three national championships with local Santa Barbara Soccer Club, most recently in 2016 —  will likely deputize for last year’s starting left back Randy Mendoza, a senior next season.</p>\n<p>Acosta’s club teammate, forward Rodney Michael, will also make the transition to UCSB; the creative forward scored 62 high school goals and won a CIF title within three years of moving to the U.S. from Sierra Leone, as well as being named to the U-18 National Championships Best-XI when he starred in SBSC’s winning run.</p>\n<p>Midfielder Hanno Antoni of Mannheim, Germany is one of two international recruits of the Gauchos’ 2017 class. Antoni is a transfer from Berry College, where he was named to the Division II First Team All-American team last season after leading his league with 13 goals and four assists. By recruiting Antoni, Vom Steeg is expecting to add goals and experience to a midfield already dominated by Big West Midfielder of the Year Kevin Feucht.</p>\n<p>Antoni is joined by international recruit 17-year-old Pablo Adrian Adames, who is coming to play for UCSB from Santutxu FC Juvenil B in his hometown of Bilbao, Spain. While in Spain, the center back played in the National League, the country’s second-best youth league.</p>\n<p>Much like center back/defensive mid-Daniel Amo, a freshman last season, Adames seems like a defender who will fit into the attacking-minded style the Gauchos prefer.</p>\n<p>After watching five freshmen — Noah Billingsley, Daniel Amo, Titouan Le Roux, Lamar Batista and Mateo Restrepo Mejia — all cement their rightful spots in Vom Steeg’s rotation last season, it’s fair to expect the same from this year’s class, which appears to feature an equally impressive level of quality. Hopefully, they will build up the program for the future, as the veteran head coach has made a habit of in his 18-year UCSB career.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of February 9th, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75581\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/gauchos-secure-standout-frosh-class-on-national-signing-day/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75581\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/gauchos-secure-standout-frosh-class-on-national-signing-day/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/gauchos-secure-standout-frosh-class-on-national-signing-day/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/gauchos-secure-standout-frosh-class-on-national-signing-day/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/gauchos-secure-standout-frosh-class-on-national-signing-day/","id":1414,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1413,1412,1411],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nick DePuy Selected 19th Overall in MLS SuperDraft","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DePuy_FILEPHOTO_soccer-4-of-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DePuy_FILEPHOTO_soccer-4-of-11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a stellar four-year career in his time with the UCSB men's soccer team, former Gaucho Nick DePuy was selected 19th overall in the 2017 MLS SuperDraft last Friday.

His remarkable total of 16 game-winning goals ranks second in the program record book and is third in conference season. Topping it all off is his feat of 226 shots which places fourth all-time in both UCSB and Big West history.</p>\n<p>Take a look inside the UCSB and Big West record books and DePuy’s imprint decorates a variety of statistics. He is the first player in Big West history to be a three-time Offensive Player of the Year, winning the award three times from 2014-2016.</p>\n<p>DePuy became the seventh player in UCSB history to receive the accolade and the latest to be given the honors since Garza in 2010.</p>\n<p>Along with taking the crown as the conference’s most dominant player for three consecutive seasons, the forward was a three-time All-Big West First Team selection over the same time span.</p>\n<p>Although he didn’t begin his collegiate career as the lethal scorer he would soon be known as, DePuy was a pivotal asset in the team’s progression since his arrival in 2013.</p>\n<p>He concluded his freshman campaign as one of four players on the team to start in all 21 of UCSB’s matches despite recording no goals that season. He was named to 2013 Big West All-Freshman Team and was also an All-Big West Honorable Mention.</p>\n<p>Originally beginning his career as a midfielder and occasionally playing in the center back, DePuy’s journey to becoming one of the nation’s best players began with Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg’s decision to start the 6’5”, 200-plus pounder at the forward position.</p>\n<p>Prior to his first career start as striker in the Gauchos’ game against San Diego State on Sept. 26, 2014, DePuy had just one career goal. The transition proved worthwhile as the move to the top of the field helped UCSB clinch the Big West North title as it ended the year at 10-7-3 and 6-2-2.</p>\n<p>His sophomore season marked the buildup to his emergence as UCSB’s top player during the conference portion of the season to lead all players in goals at eight, game-winning goals at five, shots at 42 and points at 17.</p>\n<p>The transition to forward was most beneficial the following year as DePuy would go on to have one of the most unforgettable seasons in UCSB history.</p>\n<p>His Junior season served as a breakout year in which DePuy’s eight game-winning goals and 15 total regular season goals led the nation; he also became the fourth Gaucho ever to be named an NSCAA First Team All-American.</p>\n<p>After making the move to forward, DePuy led the nation in goals with 24 at the end of the 2015 season.</p>\n<p>As DePuy produced on the field, the nationwide exposure continued to grow, with DePuy ending the 2015 season as the fourth Gaucho ever to be nominated as a semifinalist for the MAC Hermann Trophy — an honor awarded to the top Division I college soccer player.</p>\n<p>Following a NSCAA Far West All-Region Third Team selection in 2014, the forward’s astounding junior season led to him being a NSCAA Far West All-Region First Team selection just one year later.</p>\n<p>Entering the final chapter of DePuy’s career, it was expected that the Gauchos’s opponents’ primary objective would be to contain the elite striker. While some teams did manage to reduce his role in scoring, he was never completely shut down against competition.</p>\n<p>In his final season, DePuy played a team-high 1,872 minutes, led the Big West in shots per game with an average of 3.15 and ranked sixth in the conference in goals with six. Expectations were high as he entered the 2016 season on the MAC Hermann Trophy watch list, was a CSN Preseason All-American and ended up being named to the NSCAA Far West All-Region Second Team.</p>\n<p>While the abundance of awards and milestones helped bring recognition to his great talent, DePuy was an even greater leader that remained humble and could be depended on as a team leader.</p>\n<p>His legacy is enhanced by his being a counterpart to the program’s achievement of four straight Big West North division titles and its first Sweet 16 appearance since 2011 in the 2015

CSUN at Harder Stadium to remain undefeated in conference play. The Gauchos’ two early goals from junior wingers Dalton Pando and Ahinga Selemani were the difference in the last game of inter-division play as the hosts sent the Matadors home with a 2-1 loss.</p>\n<p>With the win, Santa Barbara improves to 7-5-1 overall on the season and, more importantly, 3-0-1 in the Big West atop the North division. They are now on a four-game unbeaten streak, tying their longest of the year. Northridge now sits at 5-3-2 overall, 2-1-1 in conference play.“I think we’ve gotta keep the team spirits high,” said Pando of the team’s recent success. “Everybody’s just working as hard as they can, but we have to keep this going and play every game like it’s our last now that our division is starting.”</p>\n<p>“I think we’ve gotta keep the team spirits high,” said Pando of the team’s recent success. “Everybody’s just working as hard as they can, but we have to keep this going and play every game like it’s our last now that our division is starting.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos got out to a great start, creating several chances in the opening five minutes, and their persistence was rewarded in the seventh minute when Pando found the opener. The play started when freshman winger Noah Billingsley turned his man and ran down the left wing and, after a couple short passes, sent a curling cross to the back post, where the junior was there to meet it with a soft, right-footed volley across the keeper.</p>\n<p>With the linkup, the two UCSB wingers both brought their personal tallies on the season to two assists and two goals apiece. Billingsley and Pando have both been receiving more playing time in the last few matches, and their goal was a fitting end to the means. The latter’s performance was brimming with confidence after the goal, as he led the team in shots with six and had a number of take-on up and down the wing.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara doubled its lead in the 20th minute from an equally impressive bit of play from yet another freshman. This time, it was defender Lamar Batista, who won the Gauchos the ball with an intelligent interception. Right after controlling the ball, Bautista launched Selemani through with a defense-splitting, 40-yard pass from deep in his own half. Selemani ran in behind, rounding the keeper with a classy touch and finishing the tap-in for his fourth goal of the year.</p>\n<p>At that point it looked like UCSB would cruise to their third straight win, but the Matadors recovered a goal when a Gaucho clearance bounced off the back of a Northridge forward straight onto Edwin Quiroz’s foot by the penalty spot, and he finished off the gifted chance to bring the deficit to 2-1 before the break.</p>\n<p>At halftime, the ‘Chos led CSUN 7-2 in shots as they held firm control of the game, with the visitors’ only other shot of the first half a 25-yard shot that was skied over the crossbar. UCSB ended the game outshooting Northridge 18-8 as the hosts’ defense allowed no more than one goal in the third straight match.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been working a lot in training on our defensive shape and how we pressure as a team, and I’d say that’s a big reason for the improvements in the back,” said Pando.</p>\n<p>The second half was a little less eventful, with Northridge only mustering three shots while Santa Barbara seemed content with the result as it tidied up in the back to retain the victory over one of its biggest threats to a Big West title run.</p>\n<p>Conference play continues Wednesday as the Gauchos close out their three-game home stand with a date with Sac State, which for Pando means a good chance to prove himself in front of familiar faces.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited; I’ve played with a lot of the guys on Sac State, so it’s kind of a rivalry game for me because it’s my hometown,” said Pando. “Those are a lot of the guys I grew up playing with, so I can’t wait to get after it.”</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos is the first game of North division play, in which they will host Sac State on Wednesday at Harder Stadium at 7:05 p.m. A video stream will be available on the <em><a href=\"http://ucsbgauchos.com\">ucsbgauchos.com</a></em> website.
