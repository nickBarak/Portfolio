SB 320 would have required all University of California and California State University campuses to offer medication abortion services by Jan. 1, 2022.</p>\n<p>However, Governor Jerry Brown <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-09-30/governor-brown-vetoes-abortion-pill-bill/\">vetoed Senate Bill 320</a> on Sept. 30.</p>\n<p>This new bill, <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB24\">Senate Bill 24</a> – colloquially known as the “College Student Right to Access Act” – would require public universities with on-campus student health centers to provide medication abortion to students who seek to terminate their pregnancy during the first 10 weeks.</p>\n<p>“It is critically important that we reaffirm the constitutional right of college students to access abortion care without delay, and that should always include student health centers on public university campuses,” Levya said in a press release sent out on Dec. 3.</p>\n<p>“Regardless of where they may live, Californians should have access to the full range and choices of reproductive care services so that they can plan their futures and accomplish their goals.”</p>\n<p>Research shows medication abortion has a success rate of over 95 percent, according to the press release. Serious adverse events occur in only 0.3 percent of instances.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/abortion-pill-clears-hurdle-on-path-to-public-universities/\"><em>Nexus</em> previously reported</a> that the National Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), a non-partisan council, released a report on March 16 confirming the Mifeprex pill, a hormonal pill used for medical abortions, is safe and effective.</p>\n<p>SB 24 is sponsored by the Women’s Foundation of California, ACLU California and Students United for Reproductive Justice at UC Berkeley, among others, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>“I am confident that the incoming Legislature will also approve SB 24 and that Governor-Elect Gavin Newsom will continue to stand strong in his support for a woman’s right to choose,” Levya said.</p>\n<p>SB 24 will be “considered in Senate policy committee(s) later this spring,” according to the press release.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

I felt kind of hopeless.”</p>\n<p>Residents driving out of Paradise and Magalia on the main road, the Skyway, found themselves <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/11/10/this-is-when-i-die-unforgettable-tales-of-escape-from-the-camp-fire/?utm_content=tw-mercnews&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social\">trapped </a>as the flames licked their cars, killing a number of residents.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, Magalia altered the roads in its downtown to be more reminiscent of an old town, like Truckee, Calif., Tamara said.</p>\n<p>But that meant converting two of the four lanes into parking — two lanes that were unavailable for residents as they attempted to evacuate.</p>\n<p>“Everybody was kind of freaking out, going ‘How did this happen? How did we get all these billions of dollars to change this road?’” Tamara said. “‘We need the access, because if there’s a fire, where are we going to go?’”</p>\n<p>“And so, sure enough, a fire happened and everybody was like ‘Why did they do this? It’s like they meant to kill us or something.’”</p>\n<p>The lack of official communication, coupled with the minimal evacuation routes, meant many residents died in their homes.</p>\n<p>“We’re on an emergency system. They’ve been preparing us for a couple years. Like, ‘If there’s an emergency, we’re gonna call everybody reverse 911,” Tamara said. “We all felt pretty comfortable, like they’re going to call us for any emergency. Nobody knew anything, and it was early in the morning, you know, people were still sleeping. And that’s how come a lot of people died in their homes and in their cars. It was horrifying. It was horrible.”</p>\n<p>“We felt so forgotten, so alone.”</p>\n<p>The Butsons’ house is still standing after the fire.</p>\n<p>“Our house is pretty smoke damaged inside,” Tamara said. “We have soil outside that’s toxic, and the insurance is going to give us no money. They’re only going to bring in cleaners and have them clean.”</p>\n<p>If Tamara feels that the cleaning job is not satisfactory and there are still leftover toxins, she then has to pay for tests to measure the toxicity, which cost anywhere between $1,000 and $5,000, according to Tamara.</p>\n<p>“I can’t go back to my house; there’s no way I can live in toxicity,” Tamara said. “My house should’ve burned down because if it would’ve burned down, I at least could’ve had money to then take it and then pay off the bank and then start again.”</p>\n<p>“But it didn’t, so I’m one of the unlucky ones.”</p>\n<p>Tamara, Mikala and Nick moved to Paradise when Mikala was three years old, and eventually moved to Magalia, the neighboring town.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“I’m 54. I have no idea … I just can’t make enough money starting over. I don’t know what I’m going to do.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“It’s difficult to say I enjoyed growing up there,” Mikala said. “My mom had only just been able to get a job that was higher-paying. None of the people around me had a lot.”</p>\n<p>Butte County is one of the poorest counties in California, Tamara added.</p>\n<p>“People literally … the seniors, the disabled, the single moms, they absolutely have no money. I’m fortunate. I feel fortunate. I came with nothing, but I feel fortunate,” Tamara said.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 17, President Trump visited Butte County alongside Governor Jerry Brown and Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>\n<p>“When he was giving his speech, [Trump] couldn’t even remember the name of Paradise. He called it ‘Pleasure,’” Mikala said. “His response has not been supportive.”</p>\n<p>“He has basically said it was our fault … that we should’ve raked our leaves, we should’ve done these small things,” she added. “He’s denying any bigger issue of climate change or any bigger issue of PG&amp;E being the cause of it.”</p>\n<p>Mikala spoke about the political attitudes of Butte County and Paradise more specifically. Although the area is mostly conservative, many Trump supporters questioned Trump’s response to the Camp Fire, according to Mikala.</p>\n<p>However, she doesn’t believe political opinions have substantially changed after the fire.</p>\n<p>“It’s very red, and, basically, the opinions reflect that.”</p>\n<p>There is one common sentiment on the ground: <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/11/09/pge-power-lines-may-have-sparked-deadly-butte-county-wildfire-according-to-radio-transmissions/\">Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E)</a> is to blame, Mikala said.</p>\n<p>Months ago, Mikala and her family got a notice in the mail from PG&amp;E which indicated that when there is high fire danger, PG&amp;E would shut off the power.</p>\n<p>A couple of days before the fire, PG&amp;E reported that there would be high winds and therefore the power would be shut off, Mikala said.</p>\n<p>“They had never shut off the power, even though they told us they were going to,” she said. Then, the fire happened.</p>\n<p>“There are already people who are starting the lawsuits against them and like getting legal teams together,” Mikala added. “I’ve seen hundreds of people talk about it online. If they find out that’s what caused it, it’s going to be a huge thing.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-paradise-fire-lawsuit-1542165733-htmlstory.html\"><i>The Los Angeles Times</i> reported</a> that people who lost homes in the Camp Fire have, in fact, already begun suing PG&amp;E.</p>\n<p>According to the lawsuit, PG&amp;E “did not maintain its infrastructure and failed to properly inspect and manage its power transmission lines,” the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reported.</p>\n<p>In the days since Tamara and Nick left Magalia, they traveled to Santa Barbara to stay with Mikala in her one-bedroom apartment, which is “paid for entirely by financial aid and loans from the school,” Mikala wrote on the family’s <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/butson-family-camp-fire-fund?fbclid=IwAR0Lkse9VxkxeRzEuh4HMqnqfMJqLXW9R9ffpXboxChCWDuZqxBiK18nmQM\">GoFundMe</a> page.</p>\n<p>After staying with Mikala for about a week and a half, the two found an apartment in Solvang, which they were able to furnish with two beds and a few household items with money from the GoFundMe.</p>\n<p>Mikala signed them up for Adopt a Family, a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/paradisefireadoptafamily/?ref=group_header\">Facebook group</a> to connect those affected by the Camp Fire and those who want to help. The person who has ‘adopted’ Tamara’s family has been sending them items every day from their Amazon Wish List, including a coloring book to help Tamara de-stress.</p>\n<p>But what comes next?</p>\n<p>“Wow,” Tamara exhaled.</p>\n<p>A heavy pause followed.</p>\n<p>“You know, I’m freaking out right now. I loved my job. I finally had a job that I was doing so well financially, and I had it planned out. I was paying off things, I was going to save. I had enough for taxes. I was feeling good about it,” she said.</p>\n<p>“I’m 54. I have no idea … I just can’t make enough money starting over. I don’t know what I’m going to do.”</p>\n<p>For now, Tamara sees herself putting down roots in Solvang, close to her daughter.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a really hard time having my family apart,” she said.</p>\n<p>Mikala, who will be graduating this spring, is looking to get a full-time position at the UCSB Library, where she currently works part-time.</p>\n<p>“I’d like to go to graduate school, but I was going to take the year off. But now, maybe I should just go on for financial purposes instead of taking the year,” she said.</p>\n<p>The family doesn’t see a future for them in their hometown.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think [Paradise and Magalia] are going to rebuild, and if [they do], it’s going to be many, many, many years because it’s just so devastated,” Mikala said.</p>\n<p>Tamara and her son will be in Solvang for at least the next year.</p>\n<p>“[Nick] was here awhile back and loved Solvang, and he told me many many months ago that if there’s anywhere he wanted to live, it would be Solvang,” she said. “So, I said, ‘That’s where we’re going to live,’ and here we are.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Student Association released a list of demands to the University of California regarding </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPath on Wednesday, calling for the system to provide restitution for students who have not been paid and for halting rollout of the system until problems have been addressed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara began transitioning to UCPath at the beginning of this quarter, hoping to create a more streamlined approach to paying its workers, according to the UCPath website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Student Association (UCSA), an organization dedicated to advocating “on behalf of current and future students for the accessibility, affordability, and quality” of the UC system, said UC “has not been paying its student workers” since the implementation of UCPath earlier this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Checks that are received often are for the wrong amount,” the UCSA letter read. “With the number of students who rely on being paid on time to pay rent, buy groceries, or pay student fees to enroll in their classes this is unacceptable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A copy of the UCSA demands to UC are listed below:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Immediately correct the payroll system to ensure that workers will get paid correctly and on time, particularly for those with multiple jobs and those relying on fee remission;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Acknowledge the grievances that the UC Student-Workers Union (UAW) filed on behalf of ASEs at UCR, UCSB, UCLA, and UC Merced;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Provide reparations to all students affected whether or not they are represented by a Union;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Expand financial crisis services specifically for all students affected;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Meet with student leaders and UC Student-Workers Union (UAW) representatives to discuss how to best support students affected by these problems; and</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Immediately halt to the implementation of phases 1 and 2 of the UCPath rollout until the problems stated in this letter are addressed.”</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Claire Doan, director of media relations within the UC Office of the President (UCOP), said 99 percent of UC employees have been paid “accurately and on time with UCPath.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With each each campus transition to this new system, we plan for unforeseen issues by maintaining extra support staff to stay on following implementation,” Doan said in an email. “The additional staff and resources at UC Santa Barbara will be there at least through the end of the year to help address problems.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doan said UCOP has a team in place dedicated to helping students and looking at potentially </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“reimbursing students for interest or late fees due to UCPath complications.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We understand students’ concerns and frustrations, and we are sorry about the problems associated with any instances of delayed processing of salaries and benefits due to the UCPath transition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cierra Sorin, UCSB’s Graduate Student Association (GSA) President, said that while UC Santa </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barbara administrators have been working with the GSA to combat the issues stemming from defaulted payments, many of the issues must be resolved at the UCPath hub located at UC Riverside.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The problem is that UCPath was designed to decentralize a lot of things, and so a lot of the struggle has been, and I think continues to be, things that our payroll folks and our department officers used to be able to do, they no longer can,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, students affected by the defaulted payments can apply for emergency loans, although Sorin believes the program should be more widely publicized in light of the payment issues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also said that university housing had been flexible with rent payments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorin herself had not been paid in October, and as a result was not able to pay for her university </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">housing until the end of the month. She said, however, that she had not incurred any late fees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What has been happening with housing is people have been encouraged if there is an issue with them being able to pay rent to send an email to housing,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know how widely this has been advertised and it’s something I will be speaking with admin about, because I had been hoping an email would be sent out to all folks who live in housing and are potentially experiencing problems, and I haven’t seen one.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorin lauded the UCSA demands for presenting a unified front to the UC on behalf of all UC students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I see this as is the UC community…[of] graduate students and undergraduate students coming together and telling the University of California that it is unacceptable that there continue to be this many problems with people being paid accurately and on time,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSA letter writes that UC Riverside and UC Merced experienced problems with UCPath when it was first implemented at those campuses in January 2018, without any structural fixes from the UC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These issues continued to occur months after the initial rollout, leading student leaders from UC Riverside to reach out to the Office of the President and the UC Regents last Spring. However, there have been inconsistent improvements since they first came forward and these problems have continued to persist when UCPath expanded to other UCs,” the letter read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB GSA sent out a survey to graduate students to collect responses about issues they’ve run into after hearing from the UC Riverside GSA about their problems with UCPath, Sorin said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We heard about a lot of the problems [UC Riverside has] had on their campus, and how they’ve </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">snowballed month to month, and so we wanted to see if we were starting to experience those same problems here at UCSB,” she added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beside the typical problems like being unable to pay rent or purchase food, the issues with UCPath have left students unable to pay for classes or receive parking and transportation benefits, Head UAW 2865 Steward Avi McClelland-Cohen previously told the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW 2865 is the union that represents UC student workers, but primarily graduate students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to being low on funds due to defaulted payments, students then have to pay more money out of pocket to make up for the lack of benefits, particularly with transportation, added Sorin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorin believes the root cause of the lack of structural reform is because the UC was unaware of the issues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even here at Santa Barbara, [the GSA executive board] had a meeting with [Anne and Michael </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Towbes Graduate] Dean [Carol] Genetti, earlier in the quarter,” Sorin said. “They had told us they were unaware of anything except fee remission issues up to this point because no one had shared information with us about what was happening.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that the UCSA has presented these demands to the UC Regents and UCOP, Sorin hopes more immediate and effective change is implemented.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[I hope] that President Napolitano and the UC Regents take this seriously, and invest time and energy into fixing these problems immediately such that our December paychecks are delivered on time,” she said. “I’m not optimistic though.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Nov. 15  print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
