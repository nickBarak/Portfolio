Although there were some experienced defenders out on the pitch, like junior defenders Kavian Kashani and William Gillingham, the lack of synchronicity and chemistry that only comes with playing together for extended periods of time made it too easy for the deadly Berkeley offense. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Del Mundo in particular just punished the Gauchos on the left side of the field. In the 14th minute he took the ball down the left wing again and sent a hard cross on the ground which was hammered home by freshman forward Arman Samimi, doubling the Golden Bears’ lead. The Richmond native ended  the first half with a whopping three assists after his corner kick was headed in by junior forward Tommy Williamson in the 33rd minute.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the defensive woes for the Gauchos at least can be partially excused by some key absences, the larger and more alarming issue for the team at the moment has been their inability to deliver on offense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On paper there didn’t seem to be too much of a discrepancy between the two squads: UCSB took nine shots with five on target compared to UCB’s 13 shots with six on goal, but the results (and the eye test) show that many of the offensive woes from the past year have followed the team into the new season. The issue hasn’t really been producing opportunities, but rather it’s been capitalizing on them when they appear.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior forward Will Baynham tried to jumpstart the Gaucho offense to kick off the second half, sending in a strike that was easily corralled by Cal senior goalkeeper Drake Callender in the 47th minute. That would be UCSB’s last shot until the 87th minute, however, when the game was already far out of reach.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baynham has been one of the few silver linings for the Gauchos on offense so far this season, using his big frame and surprisingly technical touch to put constant pressure on the opposing defense. The Australian forward has at the very least put in the energy and effort necessary to make things happen on the opposing team’s side of the pitch, like his game winner against UNLV in the season opener.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB can only go as far as its best players take it however, and with set-piece beast and senior defender Faouzi Taieb sidelined with an injury, junior star forward Rodney Micheal has not stepped up to the plate yet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming off a stellar campaign last season which put him in the conversation for best player in the conference, Micheal has not been able to produce the same magic so far in these first few games. Defenses are definitely game-planning for him now, and most teams are sending double teams as soon as he gets the ball. The great players take what the opposing team gives them and adjust, however, and whether it means trying to play off the ball more or looking to create and facilitate rather than solely attack, the Gauchos are going to need Micheal to be great if they’re going to have any chance of making it deep into the Big West Tournament.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this result certainly wasn’t what UCSB was looking for, the tough slate of games coming up means that there’s no time to dwell on bad performances. Coach Vom Steeg selected an extremely challenging non-conference schedule for the team, including upcoming matchups against Gonzaga, Seattle University and Stanford all by the end of September.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There might be a sharp learning curve, but if the Gauchos can pull it together and compete or possibly win a few of the games coming up they should be in great shape once conference play gets underway.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

This game will not count toward any of the teams’ regular season records; however, it serves as a great tune-up opportunity for both the Gauchos and the Golden Eagles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This game probably means very little when looking at the season as a whole and the long-term goals that the Gauchos have set for themselves; however, Head Coach Paul Stumpf and his staff are surely using this game as a chance to gauge the squad’s readiness for the regular season, and also to correct any flaws that show themselves throughout the contest.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday’s match will be the first time the UCSB women’s soccer team has seen the field since their season-ending loss to Long Beach State in last year’s conference championship game. That loss solidified their season record at a respectable 13-7-1 overall and 5-2-1 in Big West play. The Gauchos graduated 13 seniors from last year including three All-Conference contributors whose roles still need to be filled. But even with the departure of several key contributors, the Gauchos were still picked to finish second in the conference according to the Big West coaches poll that was released earlier this week. This exhibition provides a perfect opportunity to see how the players are fitting into their new roles and what the current rotations look like as we move closer to the start of the regular season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Probably the biggest storyline to keep an eye on as we head into another year of Gaucho soccer is the return of Shaelan Murison. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The senior forward is coming off of a First Team All-Conference selection last season, as well as a preseason All-Conference selection heading into this year. Murison started all 21 games for the Blue and Gold a season ago, leading the team in goals with 10, points with 24, as well as game-winning goals, of which she had five. As the best returning player on a talented team, Murison will be responsible for a lot of the offensive production this year, but she will also have to take on a larger leadership role as one of the six seniors on this Gaucho squad. In this season-opener against Cal State LA, she will likely take her first steps toward getting used to her increased role. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another player to look out for in this exhibition is senior midfielder Lynsee Voss, whose three goals a season ago puts her behind Murison for the second most goals scored among returning players. Voss appeared in 16 games and started in 14, and both of those numbers should increase this season along with her role within the team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior midfielder Christine Maurer, who, despite only scoring two goals last season, finished second on the team in shots and shots on goal, with 41 and 19 respectively, could be another key cog for UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With just a few adjustments and some off-season improvement we might see Maurer take a big leap this year in terms of offensive efficiency. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will also get our first look at some of the 14 freshmen that will be donning the Gaucho uniform for the first time this Friday. The competition between newcomers for playing time is sure to be fierce and this match could be a determining factor in who wins a starting spot for Santa Barbara’s season opener.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this matchup might have no actual bearing on the upcoming season, there’s bound to be many interesting smaller takeaways as we get to see the team in action for the first time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will take on Cal State LA at Jesse Owens Stadium on Friday at 6 p.m.. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89546\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/gauchos-set-to-kick-off-season-with-exhibition-match-in-la/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89546\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/gauchos-set-to-kick-off-season-with-exhibition-match-in-la/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/gauchos-set-to-kick-off-season-with-exhibition-match-in-la/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/gauchos-set-to-kick-off-season-with-exhibition-match-in-la/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/gauchos-set-to-kick-off-season-with-exhibition-match-in-la/","id":1334,"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone"},"related":[1333,1332,1331],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bright Road Ahead as College Cup Returns to “Soccer Heaven”","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2018-12-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MSoccer-vsCalPoly-10272018-SiavashGhadiri-5.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MSoccer-vsCalPoly-10272018-SiavashGhadiri-5.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This week, thousands of fans will pour into Harder Stadium to watch a new NCAA men’s soccer champion be crowned.

Akron, Michigan State, Indiana, and Maryland will all fly cross country, hoping that this will be their year. But how did Santa Barbara </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a school more renowned for its academic prowess than its athletic department </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> earn the chance to host the most important collegiate soccer game of the year?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In large part, UCSB men’s soccer Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg deserves credit for how far the Gauchos have come. Since his hiring in 1999, the Gauchos have made the postseason 14 times. In 2004, Santa Barbara shocked the nation by making the College Cup final, ultimately falling to Indiana in the final.

With Harder Stadium less than a mile from the beach and almost always in ideal weather, it’s not much of a surprise that teams and their fans love coming to the West Coast for the College Cup.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hosting the College Cup further reinforces what students at UC Santa Barbara already know: soccer is an ingrained tradition at UCSB. For the second time in the last eight years, Santa Barbara will be the center of the college soccer world for an entire weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When UCSB hosted the final in 2010, nearly 10,000 fans came out to watch Akron defeat Louisville for its first-ever title. After the game, Akron Head Coach Caleb Porter </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who would go on to coach the Portland Timbers </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> praised the energy that the crowd brought to the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Santa Barbara hosting both the 2018 and 2020 College Cups, there has been some talk of Santa Barbara becoming the permanent host for this event. While that likely won’t happen, it proves that the NCAA recognizes the legitimacy of UCSB as a soccer program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, the UCSB men’s soccer team will not be competing for the title this year. Despite going undefeated at home during the regular season, the Gauchos were upset in the first round of the Big West tournament by Cal State Fullerton.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, there is reason for optimism for the future. By hosting the College Cup, which will be televised on ESPNU, UCSB will become more of a household name when it comes to soccer. Ideally, this will help Vom Steeg bring in highly-touted recruits and replenish the talent pool of the squad.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

What’s been that ‘something different’ that can get us a goal?”</em></p>\n<p>vom Steeg has the expertise and know-how to have the upper hand against any opponent, but as good a problem as it is to have so much talent at his disposal, it was also a nightmare to figure out what formation would get the most out of his team.</p>\n<p>Throughout, he worked with four different formations: first a 4-2-3-1, then a 3-5-2, onto a 4-4-2, and toward the end of the season shades of a 4-3-3.</p>\n<p>An argument can be made that UCSB played the best soccer of its season in any of the formations, but once the team got slightly exposed in one setup it was on to the next one.</p>\n<p>This constant tinkering hampered players who excelled in certain roles in one formation and struggled in others, and there was no regularity for the team to grow into a formation as a unit.</p>\n<p>One such example is senior defender and team captain Jan Ilskens. If he could be listed as a utility man, that would be a better descriptor since he’s been deployed as a center back, defensive midfielder, right back and even as a striker in the past two years.</p>\n<p>After starting the season as a right back in the 4-2-3-1, he moved to right center back in the 3-5-2. With the wingback spots occupied in the 4-4-2 by juniors Ignacio Tellechea and Noah Billingsley, he began to get some playing time up top to support sophomore Rodney Michael in the forward lines. Playing out of position in attack didn’t suit him, so he moved back into the defensive midfield in the 4-3-3.</p>\n<p><strong>Consistency: Establishing Your Roles</strong></p>\n<p><em>“If you follow Gaucho soccer, scoring goals this year has always been an issue for us. When we scored goals, it usually happened in bunches.”</em></p>\n<p>The 2018 Gauchos certainly did score in bunches: Five times this year they managed to score multiple goals within a five-minute span. In the game against CSUN, it was vom Steeg’s tactical switch at halftime that worked to their favor as they scored a trio of goals in just seven minutes.</p>\n<p>Yet it was hard to spread the goals around the team and even harder to score on the road.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had just five players with multiple goals on the season. Of those five, freshman forward Carter Clemmensen’s goals were both in the opening weekend of play, and sophomore forward Kaya Fabbretti didn’t join the ranks until the final game of the regular season.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s road woes were well-documented this season, but one statistic still seems unbelievable until it’s checked against the team’s results: the Gauchos failed to score in each of their six road losses.</p>\n<p>When the Gauchos scored, they got results. When they didn’t, they lost.</p>\n<p>It should be no surprise that Michael had a goal and two assists in the road win at New Mexico and draw at UC Irvine. This year’s team relied heavily on the sophomore and oftentimes struggled to find a Plan B.</p>\n<p>This was the result of an ever-shifting midfield and attack for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The backline became solidified very early on in the season, but each game saw a rotating cast providing support for Michael and Billingsley, seemingly the only two regulars in the attacking half of the starting lineup.</p>\n<p>UCSB played best when midfielders like junior Sahid Conteh and Fabbretti made deep runs and were able to contribute to the attack. When there’s so much talent and so many different styles of play vying for such few spots on the field, it can be difficult to implement one method of play over another. Injuries and suspensions didn’t help vom Steeg’s case either.</p>\n<p>Figuring out the perfect combination in both areas will be the biggest challenge for the Gaucho coaching staff heading into next season.</p>\n<p><strong>Luck: What Every Champion Needs</strong></p>\n<p><em>“Soccer is a sport that if you don’t feel like you’re going to score, then you don’t let the other team score, and then you leave it to the penalty spot and see what happens.”</em></p>\n<p>Part of the reason why UCSB hasn’t been able to make it back to the NCAA Tournament is simply down to luck.</p>\n<p>In any tournament setting, especially one with as small a sample size as three games like in the Big West Tournament, a deflection or a shot that hits the post or crossbar can be the difference between winning and losing.</p>\n<p>In this year’s quarterfinal against Fullerton, UCSB dominated possession in the second half of the game, but sophomore midfielder Carson Vom Steeg missed an open shot, and Michael failed to convert on an opportunity late in extra time.</p>\n<p>Lady (Bad) Luck struck again in the penalty shootout when junior forward Ignacio Tellechea hit the crossbar, ironically after scoring his first goal of the season earlier in the match to get them that far.</p>\n<p>Luck isn’t just a big factor in the conference tournament; the landscape in the Big West would have looked completely different if Michael hadn’t missed his penalty in the ninth minute at UC Irvine and the Gauchos didn’t have to come from behind to secure the 2-2 draw. If anything, it’s as important considering the college soccer season features so many games in such a small window.</p>\n<p>With so many players being introduced into the fold, it may have been far-fetched to think that everything would come together in just one year.</p>\n<p>Yet the hope remains. If Tim Vom Steeg gets all of this right and the Gauchos can get some luck on their side, the next trip to the College Cup might not be far off.</p>\n<p><em>Arthur Wilkie is the Sports Director at KCSB-FM and served as the station’s lead play-by-play commentator on men’s soccer for the past two seasons.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85325\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/as-showcase-comes-home-gauchos-left-wondering-what-could-have-been/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85325\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/as-showcase-comes-home-gauchos-left-wondering-what-could-have-been/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/as-showcase-comes-home-gauchos-left-wondering-what-could-have-been/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/as-showcase-comes-home-gauchos-left-wondering-what-could-have-been/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/as-showcase-comes-home-gauchos-left-wondering-what-could-have-been/","id":1333,"author":{"id":303,"name":"Arthur Wilkie"},"related":[1332,1331,1330],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
