The first few months of the season are, and I’m exaggerating a little, a wash. After 15 games, the Kings were near the top of the Western Conference and the Stars were in the cellar. Now, just past the halfway point of the year, the teams have flip-flopped, with the Stars making a heroic rise from the ashes and looking like contenders while the Kings have been playing some ugly hockey for most of the past couple of months.</p>\n<p>What’s happened so far in the season is altogether not as important as what will happen over the next month. By the end of February, it’ll be clear which teams are aiming for the playoffs and which teams are looking to cast off spare parts at the trade deadline, which takes place in early March. Right now, there are only five teams out of 30 who don’t have a realistic shot to make the playoffs. For the rest, particularly the bubble teams, it’s crunch time.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Here are five games in the next 30 days that should be available to most of you. All of them have playoff implications and show off some of the league’s top stars:</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Philadelphia Flyers v. Chicago Blackhawks</strong></p>\n<p><em>Sunday, Jan. 23 at 9:30 a.m. on NBC</em></p>\n<p>This game is a Stanley Cup Finals rematch featuring the Flyers, who currently lead the league with 30 wins on the season and have looked every bit a contender this year, against the defending-champion Hawks, who started off the year slowly but are just now rounding into championship form.</p>\n<p>The Flyers will be getting top defenseman Chris Pronger back within the next few days and the Hawks just regained the services of Marian Hossa, Jonathan Toews, and Patrick Kane over the last few weeks.</p>\n<p>It should be a high-scoring affair with plenty of end-to-end action and some great hitting. These teams don’t like each other very much and it shows.</p>\n<p><strong>San Jose Sharks v. Los Angeles Kings</strong></p>\n<p><em>Wednesday, Jan. 26 at 7:30 p.m. on Fox Sports West</em></p>\n<p>Things have been bad in both Los Angeles and San Jose lately. Both teams, rife with talent, have shown flashes of greatness this year, but as a whole have been playing far below their potential.</p>\n<p>The Sharks, who entered the season expected to contend for the Stanley Cup, are two wins removed from a six-game losing streak and have been shutout seven times on the season. The Kings, after going 9-4-1 in December, are in the midst of their worst slump of the year. They’re 2-8-0 in their last 10 games and have sunk to 12th in the Western Conference.</p>\n<p>Neither of the two underperforming teams is in a playoff spot right now and both are clawing to get back into the race. Expect a spirited matchup with lots of physical play, as it’s a big test for both squads.</p>\n<p><strong>New York Rangers v. Detroit Red Wings</strong></p>\n<p><em>Monday, February 7 at 4:30 p.m. on Versus</em></p>\n<p>The Red Wings are the NHL’s model modern franchise. They’ve made the playoffs 19 straight seasons, the longest streak in sports, and have reached the Stanley Cup Finals six times in that stretch, taking home the championship on four occasions.</p>\n<p>The New York Rangers have been the Yankees of baseball for the last twenty years, but with only a modicum of success. After winning a Stanley Cup in 1994 and trailing off afterwards, the team tried to buy its way back to the top with big name talent, but has yet to reach the Cup Finals again since.</p>\n<p>The Red Wings have kept on doing their thing and sit atop the Western Conference, while a philosophy change in New York has gotten the ball rolling again for them. After a quick rebuild, the team now has some quality young players and is on the rise again.</p>\n<p>These two teams have a long history with each other, being two of the “Original Six” teams, and the fans have become accustomed to hating each other’s guts, a mindset that spills onto the ice and really gets the players going. It might be a low scoring game, but it won’t be without fireworks.</p>\n<p><strong>Los Angeles Kings v. Pittsburgh Penguins</strong></p>\n<p><em>Thursday, February 10 @ 4:00 p.m. on the NHL Network</em></p>\n<p>Though the Sidney Crosby Show is temporarily off the air in Pittsburgh as he recovers from a concussion sustained during the Winter Classic, there’s hope that he’ll be back by the beginning of February. If that’s the case, it’ll be the first chance for Kings fans to get a look at Sid since November of 2009.</p>\n<p>Games against top teams are always benchmarks, and this one is no exception. The Kings stomped the Penguins 5-2 the last time they played them and will be hoping for a similar result this time around, but the Penguins have the benefit of being on home ice this time around. Pittsburgh is battling with Philadelphia for the top spot in the Eastern Conference and every game in the next few months will be a key one for them.</p>\n<p>The Penguins are a damn fun team to watch with lots of speed and talent and the Kings bring their A-game against top teams, you don’t want to miss this one.</p>\n<p><strong>Washington Capitals v. Anaheim Ducks</strong></p>\n<p><em>Wednesday, February 16 @ 7:00 p.m. on Fox Sports Prime Ticket</em></p>\n<p>The league’s other superstar, Alex Ovechkin, will visit the left coast with the Capitals for a four-game road trip against Pacific Division teams in February. The Ducks and Capitals play a similar game, both depending largely on offensive firepower and speed to win hockey games, which makes for some exciting hockey.</p>\n<p>Jonas Hiller has been single-handedly winning plenty of games for the Ducks this year and will have to come up big against Washington’s big guns. Alex Ovechkin has yet to find his groove so far this year but will undoubtedly get better down the stretch as the games start to mean more; he’s a gamer in every sense of the word.</p>\n<p>The other thing to watch for is how Washington holds up against the Ducks top forwards in their own zone. It’ll be a challenge for the Capitals’ blueline and goaltending, both of which have been shaky this year overall, to hold off the Ducks talent up front.</p>\n<p>This one should be a high scoring contest and don’t be surprised if it gets chippy, there are plenty of guys who aren’t afraid to mix it up on both squads.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-31946\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-19/deity-ice-great-month-hockey/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-31946\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-19/deity-ice-great-month-hockey/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-19/deity-ice-great-month-hockey/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-19/deity-ice-great-month-hockey/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-19/deity-ice-great-month-hockey/","id":2165,"author":{"id":327,"name":"Josh Deitell"},"related":[2164,2163,2162],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":327,"name":"Josh Deitell","biography":"Not available","articles":[2165,2271,2868],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

In order to actually hold an executive office, the candidate must also fulfill the same requirements.</li>\n<li>An executive office must be declared vacant during a Senate meeting if there is the removal, disqualification or resignation of an officer. The “disqualification” portion is an addition to the previous version of legal code.</li>\n<li>Candidates can now use a preferred name when running. They have the option to either use their legal name or the name as it appears on student records for the ballot.</li>\n<li>Candidates are no longer required to attend the mixer/event/retreat that is typically held following the declaration of candidacy meeting.</li>\n<li>Any candidates involved in violations that “may have led” to party disqualification will be disqualified, while the remaining candidates will run as independents.

That’s not to say that I don’t enjoy the PE classes that begin each of my days, because I really do, but the prospect of slapping the snooze on that alarm like it owes me money and sleeping until my noon class is a little too tempting at times. This brings us to today’s theory of life as it relates to my quest to get in shape in the form of what I like to refer to as “effort points.”</p>\n<p>The points work like this: Each person is allotted a predetermined amount of life points each week. To get your ass off the couch and in a classroom or to eat good food requires effort points. Choosing instead to stay on said couch and smoke a bowl (or eat a burrito, or drink, etc.) uses fatty points which, on my scale to the right, act as negative effort points. Effort points move your life forward, fatty points move it back. At the end of the week, if you’ve spent more effort points than fatty points, you’re golden. It’s as simple as that.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>At the same time, it’s not simple at all. Everyone is different when it comes to how many life points they receive and how they use them. For example, there’s the UCSB sorority system. Homegirl Delta Gamma will hit the gym every afternoon — sometimes twice a day — and go hard while she’s there to attract Homeboy ATO. She’ll tell you all about it in a Facebook status update. So you’d think that she has a lot of effort points, right? Actually, the same girl can be spotted at 2 a.m. at Cucas six-shots deep consuming 7,500 calories worth of California burrito and racking up the fatty points. It’s all about the balance.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, you have the people who don’t necessarily drink their lives away, but don’t go jogging either. These are what we call “boring people.” Avoid them at all costs.</p>\n<p>Then there’s me. After my inaugural column went to print, I promptly stayed up until 4 a.m. in celebration of nothing and skipped the next day’s soccer and tennis classes. The following morning, I used the excuse of a new giraffe tattoo on my forearm as reason not to hang out with Legend of the Dome Kathy Gregory on the volleyball courts. Rough start. But I picked it up over the weekend, getting a hike in and playing some football on the beach. Yesterday, I went back into fatty debt when I went to soccer and tennis only to skip my next class to get in a couple rounds of Tuesday afternoon beer pong.</p>\n<p>Life is a series of ups and downs. One day I build up the effort points. The next, I drown them all in a puddle of booze. More than a few people have asked me what exactly the point is of taking these classes and what the hell I mean by “getting back in shape.” By the end of the quarter, I want to be in the black when it comes to my life points. For me, the life point system will guide me to offsetting a pitcher at Gio’s with a protein shake and a wheatgrass shot every once in a while. Step one? Get my lazy ass off the couch. At least I’m self-aware.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-31878\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-19/train-sports-editor-point-system/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-31878\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-19/train-sports-editor-point-system/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-19/train-sports-editor-point-system/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-19/train-sports-editor-point-system/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-19/train-sports-editor-point-system/","id":2163,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[2162,2161,2160],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate website by the end of week three of Winter Quarter. The resolution also directs the Senate to send out a University Announcement to the student body “to inform constituents about the website and how they can get in contact with senators.”</p>\n<p>Neither have been completed as of the beginning of week five. The resolution was passed during the Jan. 9 Senate meeting in week one.</p>\n<p>Ornelas said that updating the website was more complicated than he had originally imagined. He has been working with A.S. Web Developer JudyAnn Dutcher to make the necessary updates.</p>\n<p>“It’s just so complicated and not really user-friendly,” Ornelas said. “Honestly, it could happen by the end of this week, just to kind of make it like the [Finance and Business] visual builder, where I can just go in and edit stuff.”</p>\n<p>Ornelas also said he would try to get the University Announcement sent out by the end of the week.</p>\n<p>Senators Ricardo Uribe, Sydney Karmes-Wainer, Zion Solomon, Dallin Mello, Rafael Cornejo, Melissa Perez, Jalia Carlton-Carew, Xochitl Briseno, Ashley Ng, Alexis Bettencourt, Anthony Hernandez, Yara Khamis, Alli Adam, Jasmine Palmerin and Ornelas all created their pages by the end of week two, the deadline stated in the resolution.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 4, when the Nexus reached out to Senators Nima Bencohen, Adam Chohan, Yasamin Salari, Alex Funk and Andrew Nguyen, they had not created their public Facebook pages.</p>\n<p>Bencohen’s Facebook page went public less than an hour after the Nexus reached out. He thanked the Nexus reporter for “honestly reminding” him to make the page.</p>\n<p>“I was asking for assistance from one of my friends with making some of the graphics for the page and he has not been responding to me so this will do for now,” Bencohen added.</p>\n<p>Chohan said in an email to the Nexus that he had not made the page before the Nexus emailed him.</p>\n<p>“I had been posting my Senate information on my Facebook. My office hours were still public, just not on a page,” Chohan added. “Thank you for the reminder.”</p>\n<p>Salari said in an email that the making the public Facebook page “completely slipped [her] mind once school became harder after week 2.”</p>\n<p>“However my facebook page is now up and running for my constituents to use to reach out to me,” Salari said in an email.</p>\n<p>“With that being said I do think that the honoraria of all the senators that forgot to make their facebook pages should be docked since the original due date for the pages was week 2.”</p>\n<p>Ornelas said in an interview with the Nexus that he would recommend to Internal Vice President Steven Ho that senators who failed to make their pages by the deadline should have their honoraria docked. He estimated that the punishment should be $10 per week late, although he said it would be up to the honoraria committee’s discretion.</p>\n<p>Nguyen said that his page was created late due to personal issues, however he added that those issues are “an explanation, not an excuse.”</p>\n<p>Funk could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>Senators Lea Toubian, Carla Cernat and Gabriella Shofet created their pages on Jan. 22, and Senator Yash Nagpal made his on Jan. 23.</p>\n<p>Shofet said in an email to the Nexus that since she was sworn in during week two, she gave herself additional time to fulfill the requirements of the resolution.</p>\n<p>Toubian said in an email that she did make her page by the deadline, but later deleted it due to not having a headshot. Toubian cleared it with Ornelas first.</p>\n<p>Cernat attributed her tardiness to the “tumultuous” nature of the first two weeks, but takes “full responsibility” for creating the page late.</p>\n<p>“As I’m sure many students can relate, the first two weeks of any quarter can be an exceptionally busy and difficult time as we try to crash classes, finalize our class and work schedules, get back into a normal routine and prioritize our mental health,” Cernat said in an email.</p>\n<p>Cernat is “not sure” how honoraria would be docked or what amount should be docked for senators who did not abide by the resolution deadline.</p>\n<p>“If senators’ honoraria was to be docked for creating a public Facebook page late, I would then also expect the executive officers, who receive a guaranteed $3,000 in honoraria, to receive a similar amount of scrutiny and oversight for completing all of their required duties, trainings and obligations as senators do,” Cernat added.</p>\n<p>Nagpal said in an email that he did create his page by the week two deadline, but the page “did not go live to the public for a few days” because Facebook required him to complete the entire page, “including profile picture, cover photo, and initial posts” before Facebook “publicized the page.”</p>\n<p>He added that he has discussed honoraria being docked with other senators and Ho and he told them that he should receive a dock in honoraria “in order to be fair to the senators and student body.”</p>\n<p>The resolution also states that it will be followed by a bill to update A.S. Legal Code to require future Senates to create Facebook pages. Ornelas also plans to implement more structure for how often the pages should be updated and with what.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s just interesting to look at maybe who’s updating what Facebook pages ‘cause I know that some just posted their office hours and they haven’t really done other things, but there’s senators that are really utilizing it to post direct resolutions that they’ve passed and kind of just giving updates,” Ornelas said.</p>\n<p>“I definitely think that some senators kind of just made [the Facebook page] to follow the [resolution],” he added. “Either because they don’t want to [update it] or they don’t think about it or because they don’t have anything to update it with.”</p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi is an asst. news editor and Simren Verma is the university news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.
