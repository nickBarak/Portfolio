By law, the University of California is exempt from filing an IRS Form 990 because it is recognized as a government affiliated organization under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 115 and IRC 501(c)(3). The IRS is currently deciding whether Associated Students is exempt from filing IRS Form 990 based on its affiliation with the UC.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal said the current A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez addressed the IRS non-compliance issue by hiring lawyers to work with A.S. after she was hired in 2008.</p>\n<p>“From 2008 to 2012, that’s when we were in contact with lawyers,” Villarreal said. “Not just UC lawyers but we also brought in outside lawyers just to try to figure out where we were. We contacted the general counselor for the UC, so with their advice, we went to another lawyer who specializes in IRS matters.”</p>\n<p>Marquez said the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) contacted her about the IRS non-compliance issue.</p>\n<p>“I had been working here in my office and UCOP called me up one day asking me why we haven’t been<strong> s</strong>ubmitting our own 990 document for the prior 12 years,” Marquez said. “I researched it and I found out the reason; prior to that there had been an understanding that turned out to be a misunderstanding.”</p>\n<p>According to Villarreal, A.S. did not file the form for 12 years due to confusion about the relationship between the UCen and UC.</p>\n<p>“The reason why we weren’t filing before that was because at the time, we shared the same track ID number with the UCen because technically we are in UCen property,” Villarreal said. “Because the University files for the UCen, the UCen thought the [University was] filing for Associated Students. But they were not.”</p>\n<p>Marquez said it is difficult to categorize the tax status of A.S because it follows policies from UC Regents, A.S. Legal Code and regulations as a nonprofit organization.</p>\n<p>“The mix-up occurred because we are both a department for the campus and system, and we also hold our own tax ID number,” Marquez said. “Students wanting to be independent from the university have maintained both levels of responsibility.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said A.S. is working with lawyers to research whether A.S. should be recognized as a UC-affiliated organization.</p>\n<p>“We’re not even sure if we have to file 990s and that is still something we’re still trying to figure out with our lawyers because we’re under a governmental entity which is the University of California,” Villarreal said. “So even now we’re still working on exactly figuring out if this is something we have to do.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said because A.S. has an unclear affiliation with the UC, he does not know whether A.S. will incur penalties from the IRS.</p>\n<p>“It is a possibility that there could be fines incurred, but I’m not really sure how much,” Villarreal said. “But we have the funds that we can use for that and we can take care of it if need be. I don’t expect that to happen, but it could.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year political science major Louis Mariano said the IRS compliance issues are mostly “small technical things” that must be fixed to maintain a nonprofit organization.</p>\n<p>“IRS issues have been present in the Association for the past few years and it is an issue that the A.S Executive Director has been dealing with, informing the president and senate with updates,” Mariano said in an email.</p>\n<p>Mariano said it is unlikely the student body will be affected by the A.S.’s non-compliance with the IRS as long as A.S. continues to communicate with the IRS.</p>\n<p>“Personally, I believe that there isn’t much impact for the student body and student fees as long as the issue is being dealt with, which the Executive Director has been doing as mentioned before,” Mariano said in an email.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

area” despite previous reports of criminal activity in the area, ultimately leading to the student’s rape, according to a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/JaneDoeComplaint.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">lawsuit</a> filed Tuesday.</span></p>\n<p>The lawsuit says that at the time of the attack, “it was impossible for anyone to see or hear what was happening within the space” because of foliage that stretched for about a block. Satellite images from Google Earth show that a significant number of trees and shrubbery were removed within six months of the attack, making the location more visible from bordering bike paths and the corner of El Colegio Road and Stadium Road.</p>\n<p>Attorneys Tyrone Maho and Joshua Lynn are representing the female victim, whom the lawsuit refers to as Jane Doe, against the University of California Regents. Maho said the university made significant changes to the area shortly after the assault.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"twentytwenty\" style=\"display: none; max-width: 100%; width: 1024px; height: 561px\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NOVEMBER-2007-1024x561.png?resize=888%2C486\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/APRIL-2015-1024x562.png?resize=888%2C487\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></div><em>Use the above slider to view the location of the 2014 assault before and after multiple trees were trimmed and/or removed.</em>\n<p>“[The university] added lighting on that bike path, they’ve cleared all that [foliage] out, you can see onto campus where you couldn’t see before,” Maho said. “This was not a small project by any means.”</p>\n<p>Shortly before midnight on Feb. 22, 2014, three men took the female student, who was 19 at the time, from Isla Vista and raped and beat her at the northwest end of the UCSB track until approximately 4 o’clock the next morning, when she escaped. She then ran to her residence in I.V. where her roommate called for police and medical assistance.</p>\n<p>The student suffered a broken nose; blunt trauma to her knees, hands and abdomen; and her eyes were swollen shut, according to the lawsuit. The student also contracted herpes during the assault.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit says the attack was “the worst case of sexual assault” on UCSB’s campus, and also alleges that the university had “previously received several complaints that crimes had occurred in this area.”</p>\n<p>The <em>Santa Barbara Independent</em> <a href=\"http://www.independent.com/news/2014/mar/6/ucsb-gang-rape-investigation-continues/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> shortly after the attack that the victim was taken from near Embarcadero del Mar and Segovia Road in I.V.</p>\n<p>Because of the direct route the assailants took from I.V. to the location by the track, the victim “suspects that her rapists were extremely familiar with the foliage area at UCSB,” the lawsuit says.</p>\n<p>“Despite being on notice, the area was not illuminated or patrolled, the foliage was allowed to continue to be overgrown, and no other reasonable precautions had been taken” to keep students out of harm, according to the lawsuit.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67714\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67714\" data-attachment-id=\"67714\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/lawsuit-claims-dangerous-area-of-ucsb-led-to-rape/lawsuit_by-lorenzo-basilio-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lawsuit_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lawsuit_by Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lawsuit_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lawsuit_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67714 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lawsuit_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x684.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lawsuit_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lawsuit_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lawsuit_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lawsuit_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lawsuit_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67714\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The location of the February 2014 assault, photographed on Jan. 27, 2015. <em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Maho said the victim was “absolutely” open to settling outside of court and hoped that the lawsuit would also reinvigorate the police investigation.</p>\n<p>“Our hope with this whole thing is not only to draw attention to what the university did to basically allow this activity to take place … but also to help with the appeal to find the perpetrators because it has been two years and UC police have not found the suspects,” Maho said.</p>\n<p>Kelly Hoover, spokesperson for the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office, said “The Sheriff’s Office initially investigated the case along with UCPD” until it was determined that the crime occurred on campus, under the jurisdiction of UCPD.</p>\n<p>“The crime scene was located on UCSB property,” Hoover said. “At that point, UCPD became the lead.”</p>\n<p>Shortly after the attack, UCPD <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucpd-releases-sketches-of-sexual-assault-case-suspects/\" target=\"_blank\">released a sketch</a> of two of the three men, but none of the assailants have been found.</p>\n<p>Maho said DNA and physical evidence were present at the scene, adding to his frustration that the perpetrators are still on the loose. The lawsuit alleges that the UCSB Police Department was “understaffed and insufficiently trained” to investigate the attack.</p>\n<p>“We are dismayed that [UCPD has] not been able to find the suspects and the longer this goes on, the more difficult this is going to be,” Maho said. “Bringing this to the public’s attention by the way of the lawsuit, this will hopefully bring some witnesses forward who have some sort of information.”</p>\n<p>The lawsuit says a rape kit was performed shortly after the assault, but that it is “missing significant documentation” and does not include photos of the student’s injuries.</p>\n<p>The victim is requesting damages from the university but has not specified an amount.

Senate and meets weekly on Mondays to allocate funding to various student groups and other university affiliated projects. At the meeting, the board addressed finance requests and funded GIVE to Isla Vista, the Muslim Student Association, Model United Nations (MUN) and Unión Salvadoreña de Estudiantes Universitarios (USEU) among others. </p>\n<p>South Asian student group UCSB Indus requested $2,280 to fund a cultural dance and a cappella concert in mid-February as part of campus-wide cultural awareness week and was granted $1,880 of the request. </p>\n<p>The International Student Association also requested $1,564 to fund their “Welcome Back” concert in the Hub this Friday evening and was granted the full amount.</p>\n<p>GIVE to Isla Vista is an event held at the end of each academic year where donated student items from students moving out of I.V. in June are sold to the general public in a fundraising event for which the organization gives volunteers to staff the event. The event last year drew over 50 tons of merchandise and provided money to over a dozen student organizations. Of the requested $11,085, the board agreed to fund the group $8,766 to cover costs for a site coordinator, a volunteer coordinator, site clothing and a truck driver.</p>\n<p>The Muslim Student Association requested $1,062 for tickets and transportation to attend the 2015 MSA West Conference in mid-January, where MSA chapters from California, Arizona and Nevada will meet for three days to discuss relevant issues related to Muslim identity and collective history. The board passed a motion to fully fund the requested amount and to withdraw $230 in money previously allocated to the group last November.</p>\n<p>MUN requested a total of $25,294 for their upcoming events in spring quarter. The board decided to move $517 from the Office of Student Life spring account into an account for Academic teams, and to allocate $5,000 towards hotel fees for MUN. </p>\n<p>Unión Salvadoreña de Estudiantes Universitarios (USEU), an organization representing the Salvadoran student community, is holding a two-day annual summit that will include workshops and team building activities for groups from chapters at other campuses. The group requested a total of $1,022 of which $946 was allocated to be spent on muffins, orange juice, coffee, water and other assorted foods and utensils. </p>\n<p>According to fourth-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau, 50 percent of the foods purchased can be from Costco, but the other 50 percent need to be purchased from local or organic sources. </p>\n<p>“That’s what you all are supposed to tell them during the finance and business workshops,” Lau said. “You say, ‘You still have to use organic foods,’ and they’ll say, ‘Oh, we’re getting our food from Costco, what about them?’ You still have to have 50 percent of it be USDA organic, local.” </p>\n<p>Lau said that although the Isla Vista Food Co-op is an option for students to buy organic food, it is not necessary to purchase food there. </p>\n<p>“It doesn’t have to be from the Co-op,” Lau said. “The Co-op is automatically local and organic, but you can get it from Costco and have it be organic.” </p>\n<p>The Board also passed a motion to fully fund USEU as a one-time exception for the food costs and plan to emphasize spending restrictions in future finance and business workshops. </p>\n<p>Other fully funded groups include the professional business fraternity Delta Sigma Pi; the Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology department for their 11th-annual Graduate Student Symposium; the Indus organization for their cultural show; and the International Student Association for their welcome back concert this Friday. Recreational computer hacking group SB Hacks also requested $2,000 to help fund an upcoming “hackathon” that promises to draw some 500-600 participants, the motion to fund was tabled indefinitely.<br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59434\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-07/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-delegates-funds-to-student-groups/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59434\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-07/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-delegates-funds-to-student-groups/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-07/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-delegates-funds-to-student-groups/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-07/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-delegates-funds-to-student-groups/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-07/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-delegates-funds-to-student-groups/","id":2590,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2589,2588,2587],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
