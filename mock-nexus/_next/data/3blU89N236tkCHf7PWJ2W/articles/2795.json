During the forum, attendees discussed ways to help students overcome dining obstacles and more easily obtain groceries.</p>\n<p>According to Associated Students Food Bank Chair Katie Freeze, one of the main goals of the Food Bank is not just to feed the struggling students, but to focus on providing healthy, nutritious food, and finding solutions to problems such as grocery store accessibility.</p>\n<p>“The Food Bank exists as a service because students are struggling to make ends meet. The purpose of this forum is to help students become self-sufficient and be able to feed themselves,” Freeze said. “The Food Bank is a holistic service. We’re trying to make sure students have healthy food and know where it comes from.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>A lot of people aren’t aware of student hunger; it’s always kept on the down low. – Food Bank Chair Katie Freeze</p></blockquote>\n<p>Freeze said many students on campus suffer from hunger and the forum hopes to educate students on how to combat it and allow attendees to share their thoughts in establishing short and long-term goals.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people aren’t aware of student hunger; it’s always kept on the down low,” Freeze said. “The Forum empowers students who are personally facing hunger or encourages those who want to make a difference … Our long term goals are improving access to farmers markets and transportation to grocery stores.”</p>\n<p>According to sustainability coordinator of UCSB’s Department of Geography Katie Maynard, UCSB Sustainability wants to unite all the different groups and departments on campus to discuss food programs that occur on campus. Maynard said the goal is for all sustainability, environment and food groups to serve as a coalition rather than individual organizations.</p>\n<p>“[We are] a sustainability coalition rather than individual organizations,” Maynard said. “UCSB Sustainability is trying to create a web that happens throughout the different programs that happen on campus. [We want to] develop collective goals across the different departments and with the feedback, incorporate into the new sustainability plan.”</p>\n<p>Vice Chair of the A.S. Food Bank Committee Erick Lankey said the food bank is just one of many resources for students on campus. Lankey said instead of working to expand the organization, the food bank wants to combine with other departments to provide a wider variety of services to students in need.</p>\n<p>“We don’t want to be the highlight, there are other resources that are needed in our space, not just pure distribution of food,” Lankey said. “The idea of a food bank is a good idea, but in an ideal world, we don’t want to exist. We want to have this but also combine with other departments [to focus] for total well-being. We want to become deeper rather than expand bigger.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>They should have a broader range of choices. Students are used to eating crappy food, but what they have chance to grow and prep their food, their diets change. Just asking what people want is not a valid measure of the potential. – Environmental Studies Professor David Cleveland</p></blockquote>\n<p>During the forum, attendees broke off into groups to discuss various short and long-term goals for the campus. Environmental Studies Professor David Cleveland said the UCen should focus more on providing healthy options rather than profit.</p>\n<p>“UCen dining is restricting what they can sell [and] got rid of some healthy alternative on campus because they are competing with the dining services,” Cleveland said. “The University isn’t providing them the support first generation college students need. Resources aren’t following student demographics and there is a shortage of support for those students, which relates to their inability to get healthy food.”</p>\n<p>Cleveland said asking students about their food preferences does not always lead to healthier dining support plans.</p>\n<p>“They should have a broader range of choices. Students are used to eating crappy food, but what they have chance to grow and prep their food, their diets change,” Cleveland said. “Just asking what people want is not a valid measure of the potential.”</p>\n<p>According to Cleveland, “pressure can change policy,” meaning the only way to incite change is by fighting for it as he did years ago when the University wanted to eliminate the campus gardens in favor of new housing for graduate students.</p>\n<p>“In 2000, [the school] wanted to eliminate [the campus] gardens and there was no alternative,” Cleveland said. “They would do all sorts of stuff to manipulate us so that we don’t oppose it, but all of a sudden, at the planning meeting, the Vice Chancellor of Facilities said they would put the graduate housing somewhere else instead.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62559\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-food-bank-aims-to-educate-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62559\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-food-bank-aims-to-educate-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-food-bank-aims-to-educate-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-food-bank-aims-to-educate-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-food-bank-aims-to-educate-students/","id":2795,"author":{"id":162,"name":"Kelly Lin"},"related":[2794,2793,2792],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":162,"name":"Kelly Lin","biography":"Not available","articles":[2774,2795,3048],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

President, Internal Vice President, on-campus senator and university owned off-campus senator discussed key issues in an open forum Thursday afternoon at the Hub.</p>\n<p>Prompted by questions texted in from the audience, the candidates discussed budget, police relations, sexual assault, mental health, I.V. self-governance and the A.S. senate resolution to divest from companies carrying out human rights violations in Israel-Palestine, which was voted down at Wednesday’s meeting.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>A.S. President</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Third-year political science major and presidential candidate from Free Thinking Patriots (FTP) Jason Garshfield had the floor to himself during the presidential candidate forum due to his opponent, Jimmy Villarreal of the Open People’s Party (OPP), having a midterm scheduled during the forum.</p>\n<p>Garshfield said he aims to represent unheard voices in the student body and cited voter apathy as evidence of voters feeling alienated from current A.S. leadership.</p>\n<p>“I want to give students a voice that they haven’t been given, because I don’t believe that the current administration is adequately representing students at this university,” Garshfield said. “In the last election, only 37 percent of students voted … It only takes five minutes to vote on GOLD. So I think if 63 percent of students can’t be bothered to vote, there’s something wrong with the system. I aim to be a voice for that 63 percent of students.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>The number one thing is an umbrella and that thing is freedom. That thing is defending the rights and civil liberties we have as students. I don’t believe there is a voice for civil liberties on the A.S. Board. – Candidate Jason Garshfield</p></blockquote>\n<p>Garshfield said he believes current A.S. President Ali Guthy did not make a strong enough effort to be accessible to students.</p>\n<p>“I think accessibility is a big problem and one of my criticisms of the current administration is a lack of accessibility because I think a lot of students probably don’t know who the A.S. president is,” Garshfield said. “I’d like to have events like pizza with the president … It’s a very easy problem when you’re behind a desk to forget who you’re representing.”</p>\n<p>According to Garshfield, the police in Isla Vista should turn their focus away from “victimless crimes” and towards other crimes such as sexual assault and thefts.</p>\n<p>“Police resources are scarce … I don’t want to decrease these resources, I want them to be used properly,” Garshfield said. “A 20-year-old having a beer at a party is not something police should be going after, somebody stumbling drunk down the street not doing harm to anyone else is not something police should be going after. All sorts of victimless crimes should be ignored,” Garshfield said. “The police in this town need to be focusing on real problems.”</p>\n<p>On the topic of Assemblymember Das Williams’ state assembly bill (AB 3) to create a Community Services District as a solution to the call for increased self-governance in I.V., Garshfield said legislatures should instead be aiming for cityhood.</p>\n<p>“I think that AB 3 doesn’t go far enough. I don’t believe in half measures in relation to cityhood and so I will not settle for a Community Services District, I will make sure that Isla Vista becomes a city,” Garshfield said.</p>\n<p>When an audience member asked what Garshfield’s number one most important objective would be as president, Garshfield said he would promote freedom.</p>\n<p>“The number one thing is an umbrella and that thing is freedom,” Garshfield said. “That thing is defending the rights and civil liberties we have as students. I don’t believe there is a voice for civil liberties on the A.S. Board.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Internal Vice President</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major and On-Campus Senator representing OPP Kimia Hashemian and third-year chemistry and political science double major and current Letters and Science Collegiate Senator Zach Goulhiane running independently spoke about their goals and platforms for the position of Internal Vice President, an executive office primarily in charge of preceding over the A.S. Senate.</p>\n<p>On whether or not senators should be allowed to cast secret ballots, Hashemian said the practice is acceptable under certain circumstances, citing death threats made against UC Irvine student government members who supported a bill to remove the United States flag from the student government lobby there.</p>\n<p>“Senators need to be held accountable,” Hashemian said. “However if there is a topic where senators are threatened by students, like at UCI with the flag resolution, then I agree with a secret ballot because the safety of the senators is important to me and the most important aspect.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I want to make sure that when Week of Welcome and tabling events come around we continue to push freshman and incoming students to actually understand what we have to offer and what they can do to change UCSB. – Letters and Science Collegiate Senator Zach Goulhiane</p></blockquote>\n<p>Goulhiane said he shares a similar opinion on that issue, arguing that an individual’s safety outweighs students’ need for transparency.</p>\n<p>“It is really important to know how your representatives vote, but when it comes to circumstances in which people feel unsafe about voting because they believe certain people will be against them, I feel that since we are students, the safety of us and everyone else should be kept in mind,” Goulhiane said.</p>\n<p>Goulhiane said his experience modifying the A.S. legal code to clarify the language makes him more qualified to manage internal senate issues.</p>\n<p>“I personally was a part of the legal code reconstruction committee where we moved and around and switched ideas in sections and articles so that it all position duties would be in one area and not scattered all around. This will allow for future elected officials to know what they have to do and not have to waste a whole quarter trying to figure that out,” Goulhiane said.</p>\n<p>But Hashemian also said also has experience making changes to the A.S. legal code, and plans to further educate senators on the code’s policies if elected.</p>\n<p>“Last year I was an on-campus senator and we created the legal code that created the new structure of A.S.,” Hashemian said. “For next year, I plan on teaching senators what the A.S. legal code is and seeing what problems there are and what needs to be changed.”</p>\n<p>Hashemian said if elected, she would emphasize encouraging students to be involved with A.S. using events such as a craft fair to get students excited about student government.</p>\n<p>“Students pay $180 into A.S., but not everyone’s involved or excited to be involved,” Hashemian said. “I want to collaborate with students through my craft fair. I want to bring entrepreneurial students into A.S. This brings a whole new perspective into A.S.”</p>\n<p>Goulhiane said he plans to reach out to younger students early in the school year to get more people working with A.S.</p>\n<p>“I want to make sure that when Week of Welcome and tabling events come around we continue to push freshman and incoming students to actually understand what we have to offer and what they can do to change UCSB,” Goulhiane said.</p>\n<p>Goulhiane said he plans to work to improve I.V.’s reputation, because the public tends to confuse I.V. with UCSB, leading students to take the blame for events that are out of their control.</p>\n<p>“Making sure that Isla Vista gets fixed has been a huge priority for me and I’ve had the support of Chancellor Yang, the I.V. Foot Patrol and other entities to try and figure out a way to change Isla Vista’s image, because sadly, outside of UCSB, a lot of people see I.V. with a direct connection to UCSB and automatically assume that UCSB students are responsible for whatever takes place there,” Goulhiane said.</p>\n<p>Hashemian said while working to keep Deltopia a safe event during the first weekend of April, she came to understand volunteering as a way to potentially improve I.V.’s reputation.</p>\n<p>“Recently we have been building a better image in Isla Vista and I hope that we continue to do so. Recently during Deltopia I was part of a group called UCIV that passed out water to students and others and made sure that everyone stayed safe and out of trouble,” Hashemian said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Senators</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The three candidates for on-campus senator and the single candidate for university owned off-campus senator discussed A.S. budget, residence halls, mental health, sexual assault and divestment during their forum. All four represent the Open People’s Party (OPP) and are running unopposed.</p>\n<p>Regarding allocation of A.S.’s roughly $11 million dollar budget, third-year global studies major and University Owned Housing Senator candidate Joana Barrera said she wants to spend fees as efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p>“We plan to work as senators to distribute as much money as possible and not waste any money,” Barrera said. “It is important all fees are equally distributed.”</p>\n<p>Barrea also said she would make A.S.’s budgetary decisions more transparent.</p>\n<p>“We want to reach out to students and make sure they are knowledgeable about the fees and where their money is going,” Barrera said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A.S. should be more transparent in their financial ways. – On-Campus Senator candidate Jose Magana</p></blockquote>\n<p>First-year economics and political science double major and On-Campus Senator candidate Nawar Nemeh said he would make sure students starting official campus organizations understand how to access guaranteed funding.</p>\n<p>“Finance and Business Committee currently has a rule that any organization in OSL or basically on campus the past two years gets $250 dollar start up fund that is always guaranteed,” Nemeh said. “I would want to expand that so anyone who wants to start a student group in OSL has the necessary funds to do so.”</p>\n<p>First-year art history major and On-Campus Senator candidate Lacy Wright said she would focus on funding campus services.</p>\n<p>“I would want to focus our student fees to services that students use, especially A.S. Program Board concerts, A.S. bike shop,” Wright said.</p>\n<p>Wright said she also hopes to establish textbook banks in residence halls to save students’ money.</p>\n<p>“For more popular classes, students can share textbooks and use them there,” Wright said. “Students can save on textbooks, which costs such a huge amount of money and can be a giant burden on students.”</p>\n<p>First-year political science major and On-Campus Senator candidate Jose Magana said he has an idea for an app that would help students understand the A.S. budget.</p>\n<p>“A.S. should be more transparent in their financial ways,” Magana said. “One way I feel this would be innovative and relevant to our campus is creating an app that will let students know what was allocated to what.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh says he will work with his constituents by attending residence hall council meeting.</p>\n<p>“Increasing accessibility to A.S., I will attend hall councils on a weekly basis,” Nemeh said. “We plan to do that and engage and see what the students want.”</p>\n<p>Barrera said her main goal will be expanding Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) beyond main campus.</p>\n<p>“The one on campus is too far from students,” Barrera said. “I want to allocate funding for expanding those services.”</p>\n<p>Wright also said she wants to expand the reach of CAPS.</p>\n<p>“I want to add more mental health services to the outlying dormitory halls and resident apartments,” Wright said. “They are left unstaffed and it’s unacceptable. I will work to bring funding back to CAPS.”</p>\n<p>Barrera said she will focus on resources for transfer students.</p>\n<p>“I also want to start up transfer student center … and start an online forum for transfer students to share textbooks, share class schedules and become more united as a community,” Barrera said.</p>\n<p>Nemeh said he would work to implement reports on campus energy efficiency.</p>\n<p>“To publish a yearly energy efficiency report to see how UCSB gets its energy … and how we can move towards reducing reliance on nonrenewable energy and moving towards things like solar energy,” Nemeh said.</p>\n<p>Magana said he would help other A.S. officers create temporary housing solutions to combat student houselessness.</p>\n<p>“We want to find a way for the university to work on insuring international students or recently evicted students do not have to stay on the street or couch surf for a period of time,” Magana said. “The university can find some sort of amenity, maybe in the classrooms overnight for them to continue looking.”</p>\n<p>Wright, a survivor of a sexual assault, said she wants to expand counseling services, specifically for other survivors.</p>\n<p>“So something important to me is expanding resources for survivors, especially having enough counselors on hand to be able to work with survivors as well as making sure that they are trained specifically how to respond to sexual assault,” Wright said.</p>\n<p>Magana said his main goal will be to improve campus mental health services.</p>\n<p>“My main goal overall is working on mental health and diversifying it by getting more counselors that actively represent the student body as well as expanding these services to the residence halls,” Magna said.</p>\n<p>Regarding divestment, Nemeh said each candidate’s position does not reflect OPP.</p>\n<p>“I want to make it very clear that our opinions on these issues are ours and ours alone. The party does not take a stance on geopolitical issues,” Nemeh said.</p>\n<p>Nemeh, who said he supports divestment, said he did not approve of senate’s use of secret ballots when voting on the proposed divestment resolution at Wednesday’s meeting.</p>\n<p>“I think that is extremely unfair. I don’t think the senate should hide behind secret votes when making decisions that are so important to so many students on our campus.”</p>\n<p>Wright said she chooses not to form an opinion because she represents a divided community of students.</p>\n<p>“I believe my job, as a senator, is to represent the voices of the students,” Wright said. “Yesterday’s meeting has proven that the students are really divided, so I believe I can’t really make a stance on it if I can’t fully represent the voices of the students.”</p>\n<p>Elections for all A.S. positions will be held on GOLD April 20-23.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62557\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-candidates-discuss-community-issues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62557\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-candidates-discuss-community-issues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-candidates-discuss-community-issues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-candidates-discuss-community-issues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/a-s-candidates-discuss-community-issues/","id":2793,"author":{"id":160,"name":"Alyssa Schmidt"},"related":[2792,2791,2790],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nuglets of Wisdom: I.V.

For the past hour I had been chasing little shorebreak swells near the beach access while a group of drunken fools howled obscene stuff through a megaphone at us. Those fucking I.V. bros.</p>\n<p>I.V. bros are a special breed. They’ve got all the tendencies of normal brociety, but they’re even more ignorant, callous and stupid than the rest.</p>\n<p>It’s not just their strict regimen of playing Snappa by 9 a.m. and brofighting by 3 a.m., or their innate ability to break other peoples’ valuables and smash anything made out of glass in the most inconvenient of places. What makes me hate DP bros so much is that they can’t stop themselves from throwing large, often usable pieces of furniture and other household goods off of balconies.</p>\n<p>The “thudsplitcrack! ‘Yaaaa Bro!’” coming from shore almost made me lose my shit. A big wooden dresser tumbled down from the 6600 block of DP and onto the beach. Sharks, dolphins and crabs do not eat abandoned waste, you filthy polluters. Someone with a heart and a sense of respect for the environment actually picks all of that shit up and disposes of it properly.</p>\n<p>I hate those miserable polluting bastards.</p>\n<p>It had started as a quick, in between class sesh. The sun wasn’t shining, but to me the weather was sweet — like home in Northern California. Brisk and foggy. I was grateful that at least a few levelheaded people had chosen not to take a speedy, techno-infused trip down Taaka road to blackout alley at midday.</p>\n<p>A lull, and then a wave came.</p>\n<p>“To the rescue, here I am.”</p>\n<p>Being in the water listening to Bob triggered a memory of Bull Bay — an area 10 miles east of Kingston, Jamaica. I stayed there once for a day and a night as I passed through the country. Bull Bay is without a doubt a rough place, and thinking of my time there quickly had me brooding on the stark contrasts between here and Jamaica: standards of living, American wastefulness, what we consider a tough day.</p>\n<p>“Want you to know just if you can/Where I stand, know, know, know, where I stand”</p>\n<p>We throw away clothing, food and materials at an unhealthy, disgustingly vain rate. If it’s at Costco, it will always be available, we assume.</p>\n<p>The world is sick. The privileged members of brociety living all around me don’t know how lucky they are.</p>\n<p>“So to the rescue, to the rescue, to the rescue/ Awake from your sleep and slumber/ Today could be your lucky number/ Sun is shining and the weather is sweet.”</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus<em> surf columnist Elliott Rosenfeld might be upset when he finds out that one of the sports eds threw a shitty desk off his

LEDs in the early ’90s. <em>McLane Brown/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Nobel Laureate and UC Santa Barbara materials and electrical and computer engineering professor Shuji Nakamura gave a talk on his Nobel Prize-winning research on blue light-emitting diodes last night in Campbell hall.</p>\n<p>Nakamura spoke on how his research in developing blue LEDs has allowed lighting technology, among other things, to become much more efficient and environmentally friendly. Nakamura began studying LEDs when researching and publishing papers on the scarcely studied compound GaN for his Ph.D. and eventually invented the blue LED and white LED in 1993. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Nakamura the Nobel Prize in physics in 2014 alongside Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano, who contributed to his findings.</p>\n<blockquote><p>He has opened the door to affordable energy efficient lighting for every person in every nation — a monumental contribution to all of humankind. – Chancellor Henry T. Yang</p></blockquote>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang began the talk by introducing Nakamura, praising his achievements and contributions to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“He was awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in physics not just for inventing the best blue laser, but for being the first to create the brightest blue light, using indium gallium nitride,” Yang said. “Fast-forward to the year 2000, UC Santa Barbara was incredibly fortunate to have Shuji join our campus. His hire was like mounting the jewel in the semiconductor crown at UC Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>Yang said he thinks Nakamura’s LED will one day replace Thomas Edison’s lightbulb.</p>\n<p>“We are all here to witness first-hand the brilliance of professor Shuji Nakamura and his blue LED,” Yang said. “He has opened the door to affordable energy efficient lighting for every person in every nation — a monumental contribution to all of humankind.”</p>\n<p>Nakamura began his talk with the history of LED lighting, from growing high-quality gallium nitride (GaN) crystals in 1991, to developing blue LEDs in 1994 and up to the present. The revolution in generating white light, achieved by combining blue light with a yellow phosphor, enables energy-efficient lighting, displays, medicine and the next generation of Blu-ray optical storage, according to Nakamura.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62888\" style=\"width: 264px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62888\" data-attachment-id=\"62888\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/nakamura-speaks-on-leds/shujinakamura_mclane-brown-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL SL1\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1430250533\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ShujiNakamura_McLane Brown-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-62888\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2-167x250.jpg?resize=254%2C380\" alt=\"McLane Brown/Daily Nexus\" width=\"254\" height=\"380\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62888\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">McLane Brown/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“To make the white color, you get the blue color and the yellow color and they make white. This is only two colors so it is cheaper,” Nakamura said, “I invented the blue LED 23 years ago, so since that time many people have told me ‘oh you will get the Nobel Prize,’ but it took 23 years.”</p>\n<p>According to Nakamura, his inventions will allow the world to generate 185,000 fewer tons of carbon dioxide by 2030.</p>\n<p>“Lighting accounts for 35 percent of energy consumption in California,” Nakamura said. “By 2030, 46 percent of electricity is saved.”</p>\n<p>Yang quoted 2000 physics Nobel Prize laureate and UCSB professor Emeritus Herbert Kroemer, who was not in attendance, to describe Nakamura’s impact.</p>\n<p>“Nakamura was the one who made the breakthrough, period,” Yang said. “End of the statement. And no one else was near that breakthrough. Shuji would win the Nobel when LED lightbulbs had replaced Thomas Edison’s incandescent bulbs at Costco.”</p>\n<p>Haruna Morohoshi, a representative from Soraa, the LED manufacturer founded by UCSB professors Nakamura, Steven DenBaars and James Speck, said it took time for the world time recognize the potential in LED lighting.</p>\n<p>“Most consumers don’t understand the energy saving aspect … how much you save every month,” Morohoshi said. “It takes a lot longer for consumers to realize the value of LEDs. I think that’s why 20 years after he invented it, he finally got the Nobel Prize. The world is finally recognizing the value of LED lighting.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and accounting major Hajime Okamoto said he was intrigued by Nakamura’s research and speech.</p>\n<p>“It was great and he was funny,” Okamoto said. “I had to come here because I was really interested.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62916\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/nakamura-speaks-on-leds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62916\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/nakamura-speaks-on-leds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/nakamura-speaks-on-leds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/nakamura-speaks-on-leds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/nakamura-speaks-on-leds/","id":2792,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2791,2790,2789],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
