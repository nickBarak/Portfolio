UCSB’s non-traditional graduating seniors have lived through the most testing experiences, trotting quietly but triumphantly to the commencement stage this year.</p>\n<p>UCSB defines a non-traditional student as someone who is either married, a parent, an undergraduate over 24 or a graduate student over 29.</p>\n<p>For most people, having a child at 17 can mean an obstacle course too difficult to overcome.</p>\n<p>As only 40 percent of teen mothers finish high school and fewer than 2 percent finish college by age 30, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, the odds seem insurmountable for young parents. Statistics strongly suggest teen mothers have a trying time ahead of them on their path to education after pregnancy, one likely to end in failure.</p>\n<p>All of this is irrelevant to 20-year-old Hannah Cloe, aspiring novel writer, fiancée, mother to a three-year-old and soon-to-be UC Santa Barbara graduate.</p>\n<p>She is one of 5,770 UCSB graduating students set to shake the hand of Chancellor Henry T. Yang on commencement weekend next week.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78387\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78387\" data-attachment-id=\"78387\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/despite-facing-unlikely-odds-non-traditional-grads-persevere/image1-7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image1.jpg?fit=750%2C729&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"750,729\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"image1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image1.jpg?fit=250%2C243&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image1.jpg?fit=750%2C729&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78387\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image1.jpg?resize=750%2C729\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"729\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image1.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image1.jpg?resize=250%2C243&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image1.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image1.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78387\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Graduating senior Hannah Cloe (right) is pictured here at the Goleta Pier with fiancé Alex Zhukov and her three-year-old son, Hayden. <em>Courtesy of Hannah Cloe</em></p></div>\n<p>Cloe, a fourth-year English major, transferred to UCSB after completing her associate’s degree in neuroscience at Saddleback College. Despite beginning higher education in a S.T.E.M. field, Cloe said she realized it was not what she wanted to work in for a living.</p>\n<p>She has since been focusing on novel writing and plans to complete a manuscript after completing her senior thesis with English professor Chris Newfield. Her most recent work is about a hiker traveling the Appalachian Mountains.</p>\n<p>Cloe said she has a passion for “writing about the human experience” and dreams of completing an MFA in creative writing at Columbia University.</p>\n<p>Despite Cloe’s academic achievements, she once felt her life was over when she became pregnant at the age of 17. She said people she knew had told her that her life was over and it “certainly felt that way.”</p>\n<p>She said being a young mother has been difficult because of the stigma that people have over young parents.</p>\n<p>“I’ve once had a man say to me, ‘You shouldn’t be out here; you’re a bad example for my daughter,’” she said.</p>\n<p>But Cloe was not deterred.</p>\n<p>She enrolled as an English major at UCSB in 2016, taking over 21 units a quarter to complete her B.A. in one year. She wakes up at 6:30 a.m. every morning to prepare her three-year-old son, Hayden, for daycare and attending school full time.</p>\n<p>“And these people know nothing about my life; I’ve worked hard to go against what the odds were against me, and I’m proud to say I’ve almost done that,” she said.</p>\n<p>UCSB will say goodbye to many more students like Cloe who have overcome great odds and gone on to achieve incredible things.</p>\n<p>Kou Collins, 24, will also be walking this year to receive his bachelor’s degree in communication.</p>\n<p>He transferred from Santa Monica College and the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he admits having suffered depression. He said school in Boulder was difficult for him, and he struggled to deal with the new environments and people.</p>\n<p>Collins served as on-campus senator for the Associated Students (A.S.)

conquering the 14,505-foot peak located in Sequoia National Park. The group had no high-altitude training and no previous experience hiking the summit.</p>\n<p>The climbers woke up the day of the climb at 2 a.m. to begin the ascent by 3 a.m. They summited the mountain by 11:30 a.m., taking a one-hour break at the crest and then continuing down the mountain to reach the base at approximately 5:30 p.m. By midnight they arrived back in I.V., and many cadets attended class the following day.</p>\n<p>The excursion was incorporated into the ROTC preparation for the Ranger Challenge competition in Fall Quarter, during which 11 UCSB ROTC cadets compete as a team in a series of military skills events against teams of cadets from other universities around the country.</p>\n<p>ROTC cadets Dominique Chan, third-year global studies major, and Theo Vance, second-year communication major and a team captain who helped organize the climb, both described the ascent to Mt. Whitney’s peak as a mental and physical test that rivaled anything they have experienced in their cadet training.</p>\n<p>The typical hiker will take two days to make the climb, camping overnight at 10,000 to 12,000 feet to acclimate to the elevation and then summit the mountain the following day.</p>\n<p>Both Chan and Vance agreed, however, that the one-day climb made for a more rewarding endeavor, with more notable bragging rights.</p>\n<p>“I have never done something that gnarly before. I knew it would be hard. I didn’t realize it was going to be that hard,” Vance said. “But it was the comradery of it. ROTC kids are kind of tough by necessity. So just knowing that you’re not the only one being pushed, that you’re all in it together, and you start as a team, and you finish as a team.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78234\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78234\" data-attachment-id=\"78234\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/rotc-cadets-conquer-mount-whitney-in-under-15-hours/img_4218/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_4218\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78234\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218-1024x768.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=1832%2C1374&amp;ssl=1 1832w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=1376%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78234\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Dominique Chan</em></p></div>\n<p>Chan said the climb was definitely harder than she had anticipated. Though many cadets had taken Diamox prior to reaching Mt. Whitney, a diuretic that reduces the symptoms of altitude sickness, the elevation was by far the most difficult aspect to overcome and caused extreme shortness of breath and painful headaches throughout the group.</p>\n<p>“Reaching those heights in one day really starts to get at you,” Chan said. “[Elevation] really is the great equalizer and it’s quite humbling, actually … There’s still that kind of varying level of fitness, but I think it’s interesting that the most fit cadet was struggling, relatively, as much as the least fit person who went up to Mt. Whitney.”</p>\n<p>Vance said the cadets were told this was likely one of the most challenging times in the last 10 years to make the climb because of heavy snowfall this past winter.</p>\n<p>“The trail normally takes you on this marked path that has a railing and all this stuff. That was about 10 feet below us, apparently, from all the snow,” Vance said.</p>\n<p>He added that the use of ice axes and crampons, traction devices attached to footwear for improved stability, were “absolutely vital” because the path was difficult to navigate.</p>\n<p>Vance said the warm weather made for a beautiful day to climb but also increased the difficulty of the ascent.</p>\n<p>“[The snow] was very soft, very sludgy, and that’s very dangerous on this portion called the chute, which is kind of the steepest part,” Vance said.<br>\nThe cadets made the climb up the snow chute, an area directly between the switchbacks and face of the mountain, in approximately an hour and a half with the help of their snow equipment.</p>\n<p>“It’s just straight absolute uphill, and you are just ice-axing it the entire way and using your crampons,” Vance said. “Even with that, you’re slipping and sliding sometimes, and you lose your footing.”</p>\n<p>“Without the crampons, we could have fallen to our death, basically, or rolled down, tumbled down,” Chan added.</p>\n<p>Vance said being comfortable with the ice equipment became critical on the descent down the snow chute, a 60-degree downhill that measures approximately 1,500 feet.</p>\n<p>“The chute, because it was so steep, there’s no way to get back down,” Vance said. “So it took us about an hour and a half, hour and 40 to get up, and for me personally it took about 35 seconds to get down.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78236\" style=\"width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78236\" data-attachment-id=\"78236\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/rotc-cadets-conquer-mount-whitney-in-under-15-hours/img_4248/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?fit=960%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_4248\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78236\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78236\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Dominique Chan</em></p></div>\n<p>The cadets trekked through varied terrain throughout the day, with changes in environment coming quickly with little warning.</p>\n<p>“When you’re coming up, it’s just kind of mountain wilderness,” Vance said. “Then eventually, out of nowhere, it just turns into snowy woods … The higher you get it just becomes more and more just kind of rocks and boulders and just snow. Then, once you get past the chute, it’s just all mountain range. Once you’re up at the steep portion, you go behind this ridgeline, and pretty much there you can see just for miles, just mountain tops.”</p>\n<p>“At that point you’re going single file, so you get to the hardest part, and then single file, you’re hugging the side of a mountain,” Chan added. “That’s like 13,000 feet, so the last part is only a thousand-foot climb, but it’s just, like, two more miles of just making your way up there.”</p>\n<p>Vance said while the snow made the journey more challenging, it also added to the beauty of the scenery.</p>\n<p>“You can see just mountain ranges on mountain ranges and you can see the lakes and rivers and stuff, but they’re frozen over,” Vance said. “It’s kind of interesting to see the different tints of snow because you can pick out different landmarks, but it’s still just all snow. It’s really beautiful.”</p>\n<p>Cadets who wanted to make the climb trained throughout Spring Quarter at 5:30 a.m. three days a week for an hour prior to their required ROTC workouts at 6:30 a.m. The group also met Wednesday nights for skills training, for a total of four additional hours of training a week.</p>\n<p>“The team that wanted to come out, we had tryouts, and kind of the incentive for them to work hard this quarter was that at the end we would climb Mt. Whitney,” Vance said. “The training was kind of geared around getting people in shape for Ranger Challenge and teaching them stuff that they would need to know but also to prepare for Whitey as well.”</p>\n<p>Both Chan and Vance said they packed only granola bars and water to sustain themselves through the climb.</p>\n<p>“I had probably a 25-pound pack and half of it was probably water. I didn’t end up drinking all of it, but it was important that some people brought more for the people that brought less because a lot of people ran out along the way,” Vance said.</p>\n<p>Chan said as an inexperienced climber she appreciated all the research the team captains put into preparing for the trip to ensure the entire group’s safety.</p>\n<p>“The team captains made sure to really study up and research what was needed ahead of time to really make sure to take care of their people,” Chan said. “Overall, not only was it a really cool adventure, but I think it was a really good leadership training exercise for the people who were in charge of this trip.”</p>\n<p>Vance said although four members of the group had to turn back due to altitude sickness, he was still very happy that the remaining 12 were able to reach the summit with little trouble.</p>\n<p>“We all came back as a group,” Vance said. “I was very, very impressed with how many people got through it, considering how tough it was and just the conditions … like the sheer brutality of it, because altitude sickness is one of those things you can’t train for.”</p>\n<p>Chan said team comradery motivated the cadets to reach to the top, as they relied on each other for support to push their physical and mental boundaries.</p>\n<p>“There were definitely periods of just silence, I think mostly because people were just so tired and so focused that it would take even more energy to even talk,” Chan said. “But I don’t think I could have made it up there without all my friends.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, June 1, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78279\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/rotc-cadets-conquer-mount-whitney-in-under-15-hours/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78279\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/rotc-cadets-conquer-mount-whitney-in-under-15-hours/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/rotc-cadets-conquer-mount-whitney-in-under-15-hours/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/rotc-cadets-conquer-mount-whitney-in-under-15-hours/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/rotc-cadets-conquer-mount-whitney-in-under-15-hours/","id":2382,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[2381,2380,2379],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Renovated Food Bank Reopens with Hopes for Refrigeration and Food Recovery","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4373.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4373.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Associated Students (A.S.)

The students have built a whole new culture of destigmatizing the need for being secure of where your next meal is going to come from,” she said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78295\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/renovated-food-bank-reopens-with-hopes-for-refrigeration-and-food-recovery/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78295\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/renovated-food-bank-reopens-with-hopes-for-refrigeration-and-food-recovery/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/renovated-food-bank-reopens-with-hopes-for-refrigeration-and-food-recovery/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/renovated-food-bank-reopens-with-hopes-for-refrigeration-and-food-recovery/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/renovated-food-bank-reopens-with-hopes-for-refrigeration-and-food-recovery/","id":2384,"author":{"id":101,"name":"Allison Garfield"},"related":[2383,2382,2381],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Career Services To Replace Gaucholink with New Jobs Database","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-05-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-30-at-3.40.53-PM.png?resize=355%2C224&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-30-at-3.40.53-PM.png?resize=745%2C224&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Career Services plans to replace in June its online jobs database, Gaucholink, with a new website called Handshake.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Career Services plans to replace in June its online jobs database, Gaucholink, with a new website called Handshake.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handshake is a website that connects over 170,000 schools with over 120,000 employers across the nation, including 95 percent of Fortune 500 companies. Students can expect to receive an email invitation to join Handshake around June 16. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Career Services suggests students download any important documents from Gaucholink before the end of Spring Quarter.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Gaucholink, Handshake connects students to employers and provides potential internship opportunities by allowing students to share their resumes and search and apply for jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Career Services counselor and coordinator Eric Wilder said </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handshake allows students to create a “more in-depth profile,” which he said will allow them to more easily find jobs and internships as well as interact with employers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers searching to recruit college students are able to access Handshake and view the resumes of applicants, which are directly displayed on the students’ profiles, and post employment or internship opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handshake is designed to provide organizations with a “single login experience” in which they can find all the necessary information about a student on one interface. Career Services staffers believe this will encourage employers to interact more with the website and the students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Career Services expects Handshake to provide an “easier” and more “user-friendly” interface that will increase communication between companies and students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB students can access a much wider array of employment and internship opportunities [with Handshake],” Wilder said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website also uses algorithms “similar to the ones on Netflix” to match students with jobs or internships that correspond to their interests and areas of study. It is for this reason that Handshake provides a more “fluid experience” for both students and employers, Wilder said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handshake additionally allows students to look for career fairs, establish interviews with prospective employers and search for other career-related events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are looking into future rollouts that will allow students to easily identify career events and resources that match their interests,” Wilder said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78196\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78196\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/","id":2383,"author":{"id":81,"name":"Victoria Gurrola"},"related":[2382,2381,2380],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
