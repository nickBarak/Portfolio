Is this in any way going to offend a group that has already been marginalized, and am I contributing to a larger problem within society?’” Abubo said.</p>\n<p>S.C.O.R.E. Co-chair and third-year biology major Karen Sidhu said lack of understanding is the biggest cause of cultural appropriation.</p>\n<p>“I feel like [people] don’t know how much they’re damaging people who are hurt by what they do,” Sidhu said. “They don’t see what they’re doing and they don’t see the effects of it.”</p>\n<p>Sidhu said students should avoid wearing costumes that might be considered cultural appropriation.</p>\n<p>“If your costume could potentially offend someone, don’t wear it,” Sidhu said.</p>\n<p>S.C.O.R.E. Co-chair and third-year global studies major Unique Vance said many students feel it is acceptable for them to borrow from other cultures because they view themselves as “colorblind.”</p>\n<p>“A lot of people don’t want to recognize race or racism even though the dynamics are still there,” Vance said. “Instead, they’d rather say ‘Oh I don’t see color, so it doesn’t matter if I wear this or do this and that; I’m showing respect.’”</p>\n<p>Vance said students need to be open to criticism from minorities who feel their culture is being appropriated.</p>\n<p>“If somebody does come talk to you or call you out on cultural appropriating their culture or another culture, don’t just close your mind to it,” Vance said. “Don’t just think people are attacking you, because it’s a really big issue.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65877\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1679167283\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65889\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65877\" data-attachment-id=\"65877\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/workshop-aims-to-educate-on-cultural-appropriation/culturalappropriation_by-riley-esguerra-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Riley Esguerra\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1445926356\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"1000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CulturalAppropriation_by Riley Esguerra-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65877\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Riley Esguerra/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65877\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riley Esguerra/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>According to Vance, white people are routinely praised for cultural appropriation, and elements taken from minority cultures often become popularized by white celebrities.</p>\n<p>“All these cultural hairstyles and clothes from people of color are becoming mainstream and accepted now [that] they’ve been put on white models or actresses or celebrities, like the braids and the cornrows,” Vance said. “There is a different perception of that compared to a black person wearing it.”</p>\n<p>S.C.O.R.E.

Senate passes bills to establish student councils, redefine S.T.A.R.K. funds, and create a digital database. <em>John Clow/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students (A.S) Senate met Wednesday evening in the Flying A Room in the UCen to discuss three bills.</p>\n<p>Senate voted on and passed “A Bill to Establish a Student Council for the College of Creative Studies (CCS) and College of Engineering (CoE)” and “A Bill to Reform the Science, Technology, Aerospace and Research Kapital (S.T.A.R.K.) Fund” and moved “A Bill to Promote Increased Transparency in A.S.” to the Campus Affairs Committee. Public forum included first-year CCS music composition major Jordan Mitchell and Senate Coordinator and Director of Accountability Michelle May. Senators also provided a report of the “Breakfast with Librarians.”</p>\n<p>Mitchell said he supports the creation of the CCS and CoE student council to improve campus representation in A.S.</p>\n<p>“It is within our rights as an underrepresented college to be equally represented in university and student affairs at UCSB,” Mitchell said. “It will provide crucial space for CCS representation, helping [allow us] to do much more things.”</p>\n<p>May said each senator must fulfill their senate responsibilities as outlined in the A.S. legal code.</p>\n<p>“You all must undertake four or five projects this year,” May said.  “And one must be a group project.”</p>\n<p>According to Internal Vice President and fourth-year sociology major Kimia Hashemian, senators had previously discussed the potential features of the new library space during the “Breakfast with Librarians” event.</p>\n<p>“The students wanted more outlets, so we are giving them outlets.” Hashemian said. “Another thing they’re really interested in — Senator [Jerel] Constantino brought this up — is e-books, so e-coursereaders, since textbook affordability is number one in their priority.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and second-year undeclared major Natalie Jordan said she talked with librarians about creating resource centers, such as a space for mental health services in the library.</p>\n<p>“There’s going to be a transfer center in the inside of the library,” Jordan said. “They were super unwilling to have C.A.P.S. [Counseling &amp; Psychological Services] — they wanted it to be strictly a study space.”</p>\n<p>The consent calendar was passed during this meeting, which included “A Bill to Create a Self-Care Portion for the Declaration of Candidacy Meeting,” “A Resolution to Create a Group Project For the Alternative Transportation Project,” “A Resolution to Create an Ad-Hoc Committee to Fill the Vacant On-Campus Senator Positions” and “A Resolution in Support of a Student Advisor Position to the UC Board of Regents and UC Regent Avi Oved’s Shared Governance Proposals.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year history of public policy and political science double-major Jerel Constantino presented Austin Hechler’s bill “A Resolution to Make A.S. More Transparent,” which outlines the plan to improve A.S transparency through creating a digital database for important documents, including reports, minutes, bills, resolutions, projects and other related documents.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 12 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Plan B One-Step pill. <em>Courtesy of Her Campus UCSB</em></p></div>\n<p>Her Campus at UC Santa Barbara is hosting an event at the University Center (UCen) Thursday in conjunction with contraceptive company Plan B One-Step, titled the “Perfectly Imperfect” initiative to educate students on contraception.</p>\n<p>The event will be from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., and MTV “Girl Code” stars Carly Aquilino and Nessa Diab will speak about their personal experiences, while health professionals will also be lecturing on important information to know concerning contraception. The nation-wide campaign, sponsored by Plan B One-Step, aims to educate women about their reproductive health and the various methods of contraception that are available to them.</p>\n<p>UCSB Her Campus Campus Correspondent and third-year environmental studies major Helen Gannon said the primary objective of the event is to educate women on the emergency contraceptive Plan B, which is usually taken when other forms of birth control fail.</p>\n<p>“The main point is to make sure these women are educated in case their birth control plans do not go as perfectly as they had originally planned,” Gannon said in an email. “The initiative wants women to be true to themselves, without having the need to feel perfect, and do what they feel is right, to them.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Her Campus Campus Correspondent and fourth-year English major Kirby Beaton said she hopes the “Perfectly Imperfect” initiative will help spread information about reproductive health to students who may have difficulty finding resources about Plan B.</p>\n<p>“I think this event will educate students about their options when it comes to reproductive health and that being imperfect is perfectly okay,” Beaton said in an email. “It will also be a way to engage with students through the photo booth and free goodies that our team will be offering!”</p>\n<p>Her Campus’s National team Campus Development Associate Cara Chiaramonte said the relatable experiences of the “Girl Code” stars will attract students to the event.</p>\n<p>“Carly and Nessa have imperfections just like the rest of us, and they’re letting college women know that it’s okay to embrace them,” Chiaramonte said in an email. “College women relate to other women who can be real and get on their level so I think having them on an initiative like this is perfect — no pun intended.”</p>\n<p>According to Chiaramonte, students from other universities have responded positively to the “Perfectly Imperfect” initiative.</p>\n<p>“Students have been flocking to our awesome photo booth during the day to share what makes them Perfectly Imperfect,” Chiaramonte said in an email. “Student and local media outlets have been debunking common myths about emergency contraception at night.”</p>\n<p>Chiaramonte said she wants the audience to feel comfortable in their own skin, embrace their flaws and understand the options available to them when things do not go according to “plan.”</p>\n<p>“Our Her Campus chapter here at UCSB has worked extremely hard planning this event and bringing it to share with the UCSB community,” Chiaramonte said in an email. “We can’t wait to see it come to life!”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 9 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

and drought sustainability. <em>Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB is participating in the UC-wide #UCool Campus Challenge from Oct. 6 to Dec. 10 in an effort to reduce the University’s carbon footprint and make positive contributions to the environment.</p>\n<p>University of California and UC Berkeley’s Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory created #UCool with the goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2025. The campaign, modeled after the Cool California Cities Challenge, encourages students to accumulate points for each university by completing 50 online pledge challenges. The pledges include energy efficient moves such as switching to LED lighting and turning off computer monitors. Participants will have opportunities to win eco-efficient prizes such as solar-powered cellphone chargers, and the university with the highest score will be deemed the “Coolest UC Campus.”</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Chris Berry said the challenge will require a large amount of student participation to be effective, but he hopes the goal of carbon neutrality will be reached.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a really cool campaign, and [with] more incentive for students to do it, it could be meaningful,” Berry said. “If we really are interested in [achieving] carbon neutrality, the school can do all they can, but if you have students who don’t care and don’t do work, we’re not going to achieve that goal.”</p>\n<p>Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) Co-chair and third-year computer science and environmental studies double-major Nicholas Frey said the most difficult part of the #UCool challenge is encouraging students to participate in the event.</p>\n<p>“One of the harder challenges is changing people’s behavior on things,” Frey said. “One of the major issues is getting the student population engaged and educated on how they can be sustainable in their actions.”</p>\n<p>According to Frey, UCSB needs total student and faculty involvement for the campaign to achieve the 2025 goal.</p>\n<p>“I think you need infrastructure change, so you need to be, like, adding solar on campus to make it carbon neutral, but I don’t think it’s totally possible if you don’t have faculty and student engagement,” Frey said. “The whole campus can’t become carbon neutral if it’s just the facilities; it has to be the people also.”</p>\n<p>Frey said students should contribute anything they can to the challenge even if they cannot be consistent in their actions.</p>\n<p>“[A misconception] is that you have to be absolutely perfect, and if you slip up you’ll be criticized. That’s not the point; people shouldn’t feel … discouraged to be sustainable,” Frey said. “We don’t live in a world where being some perfect hippie environmentalist is even possible. I just encourage people to learn and explore.”</p>\n<p>According to Associated Students Environmental Program Director Sarah Siedschlag, UCSB has already made great strides towards becoming more environmentally friendly.</p>\n<p>“UCSB has done a lot. For a research university of our size, we’re actually very good in water conservation … the vast majority of our landscape is done with recycled water,” Siedschlag said. “We are prepared, or becoming prepared, for a situation in the future where we might just have longer and longer droughts.”<br>\nSiedschlag said she hopes the Cool Campus Challenge will encourage students and faculty to “engage as groups” in efforts toward environmental conservation.</p>\n<p>“I’m hoping that it gets students to think about it and also makes it something that people talk about and is part of their daily lives, and that people don’t just do themselves but encourage their friends to do,” Siedschlag said. “I think that’s what’s really fun — people are building teams with the Cool Campus Challenge and getting really competitive about it.”</p>\n<p>According to Siedschlag, UC achieving carbon neutrality by 2025 is an attainable goal.</p>\n<p>“I think it depends on what you include and how far you are willing to go,” Siedschlag said.</p>\n<p>According to professor of sociology John Foran, the environment is the “defining issue” of the century.</p>\n<p>“The biggest issue is climate change. It is the biggest existential threat to humanity ever because it calls the whole future into question,” Foran said. “We really have to make deep, deep changes in the ways we organize ourselves in society.”</p>\n<p>According to Foran, converting to a vegetarian or vegan diet is “without question, the single most important” factor in reducing students’ carbon footprint. Foran said the Cool Campus Challenge should emphasize the importance of this change.</p>\n<p>“This is an important thing to underline: the UC Cool Campus Challenge and the perspective of the impact of food, diet and individual behavior change,” Foran said. “The Campus Challenge, as good as it is, needs to be recalibrated to the reality of that. That is good for climate, that is good for our health, pollution, good for the oceans, and it’s good for reducing inequality on a global scale.”</p>\n<p>Berry also said he believes food choices have a very real effect on the environment.</p>\n<p>“One of the biggest things [affecting] environmental climate change is how we eat, and Americans really enjoy meat, and meat is detrimental to the environment, especially in the way it is produced,” Berry said.</p>\n<p>According to Siedschlag, UCSB has a good chance at winning the challenge because of student and faculty dedication to the environment.</p>\n<p>“I think we do have a good chance,” Siedschlag said. “We’ve got a lot of really dedicated students and a lot of groups that have gotten really into it, there’s still plenty of time left, and I think we can definitely do it.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65679\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucool-challenge-seeks-carbon-neutrality/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65679\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucool-challenge-seeks-carbon-neutrality/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucool-challenge-seeks-carbon-neutrality/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucool-challenge-seeks-carbon-neutrality/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucool-challenge-seeks-carbon-neutrality/","id":2672,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2671,2670,2669],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
