To be a man in the world of sports is to shut out fear and uncertainty, to exude aggressiveness and passion and to limit doubt and over-thinking. To be a man is to win.</p>\n<p>Other than the archaic gendered connotations of the phrase, these lessons aren’t necessarily bad on paper. Many coaches point to the application of what they teach even outside of sports as rationale for why athletes should listen. American society is theoretically organized to value self-confidence and hard work. There’s supposed to be winners and losers, and if you believe in yourself and put in the work then you can achieve anything. We use Kobe Bryant’s relentless perfectionism, LeBron James’ refined diet and workouts and Michael Jordan’s extreme work ethic as examples of those at the top getting to where they are by devotion and, more importantly, by choice. Of course they are successful; they chose to work hard to get there.</p>\n<p>Due to the innate link between economic success and happiness in the American consciousness, this ultimately comes to mean that they chose to be happy, and by extension anyone else with just some hard work and elbow grease can choose to be happy too. But what about the millions of people who don’t always have the opportunities or resources or neurological capabilities to “choose” to be happy — where do they fit in?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Toronto Raptors’ perennial All-Star DeMar DeRozan made headlines recently because of an interview around this topic with the Toronto Star. “It’s one of them things that no matter how indestructible we look like we are, we’re all human at the end of the day,” DeRozan explained. “We all got feelings … all of that. Sometimes … it gets the best of you, there’s times everything in the whole world’s on top of you.”</p>\n<p>This interview came on the heels of a tweet which DeRozan sent out in February that simply read “This depression get the best of me…” and sparked a national dialogue around how society stigmatizes and stifles mental health awareness among male athletes. Cavaliers forward Kevin Love expanded on this conversation in a piece he penned for the Players’ Tribune, in which he pointed out that “These values about men and toughness are so ordinary that they’re everywhere . . . and invisible at the same time, surrounding us like air or water.”</p>\n<p>There are two especially important points that DeRozan and Love made in their statements, and both offer solutions to deal with the issues surrounding mental health education. The first is that anyone at any time can be affected by some sort of mental illness, although it is important to note that there are very important outside factors (degree of illness, race, gender identity, economic status) which affect both the support for and impact of these problems. The second is that there is a very specific socialization of men, by men, that occurs in the United States, which manifests itself into toxic ideologies and actions for men ourselves and the communities we inhabit.</p>\n<p>It goes without saying that in order to start working on the issues of misrepresentation and miseducation when it comes to mental health, there has to be acknowledgment that there are problems in the first place. This is why it was important to hear not just an NBA player, but a Black NBA player, come out and address a topic like depression.</p>\n<p>Centuries of oppression, whether it be through the restriction of access to medical knowledge and care or the dehumanization and desensitization of Black and brown suffering, has created extreme stigma within communities of color surrounding mental health. Black Americans are more likely to undergo feelings of depression and worthlessness than white Americans, and yet, according to Mental Health America, have less access to treatment and actually utilize help at far lower rates.</p>\n<p>It would be far simpler to address these statistics if it was simply a matter of outward exclusion; however, internal attitudes ingrained over the years complicate accessibility as well. Because of historical precedents such as the Tuskegee Syphilis experiment or contemporary exclusion from groups such as the American Psychological Organization (of which Black Americans only make up 2 percent), there has been a cultural isolation of Black and brown communities from the medical community, which in turn has led to the solidification of negative and inaccurate ideologies.</p>\n<p>The characterization of mental illness as “weakness” or as in opposition to masculinity is very prevalent within these communities and has a tangible impact, such as the marginally higher attempted suicide rates among young Black boys compared to white children. By exposing his own fragility, DeRozan has helped counter this and start toward creating an atmosphere where Black and brown children are believed and supported.</p>\n<p>It is important to note, however, that it is men who have to take on most of the burden of unlearning and working toward less stigmatization of mental illness. As we have seen with recent mass school shootings, as well as the well-documented history of male violence in this country, our conception of masculinity or “manhood” is just not healthy. Entitlement and over-confidence combined with a lack of empathy for others might work sometimes on the basketball court, but is a disastrous approach to relationships in other aspects of life.</p>\n<p>The truth is, for women and queer folks of color, most danger and abuse does not come from outside, but rather from straight men of color in their own communities. While all people of color have to deal with racism, stigma surrounding mental illness and lack of accessibility in other aspects of life, it is somehow acceptable to use violence against Black and brown women as an outlet for male frustration and inadequacy. This is a problem for all men, yet one would hope that having to deal with an intersection of other oppressions would give Black and brown men a better understanding of how not to channel their problems into “punching down.” Only once we are able to protect those who are most vulnerable will we be able to attack the institutions or figures in power which are the crux of the problem.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, sports both reflect and create culture. Athletes such as DeRozan and Love speaking up about their own struggles with mental health mirrors a recent illumination of the topic in popular discourse; however, toxic ideals surrounding masculinity in sports have also been ingrained into American society for years. It is up to men to change how we talk and think about mental health, for our well-being and everyone else’s safety.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 24</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

This game was won in the circle with stellar performances from both sophomore pitcher Alex Pingree and senior pitcher Andriana Collins. Collins started the game and pitched four innings, only giving up one run in the process on a wild pitch. Pingree would then come into relief to pick up her first save for the team, recording four strikeouts in her two innings of play.</p>\n<p>The team’s next matchup was the first of a back-to-back with the University of Northern Iowa, which owned a record of 7-4. Santa Barbara put on a defensive clinic by once again only allowing one run in this 15-1 victory. Junior Shelby Wisdom would pick up the win and improve her ERA to 1.97.</p>\n<p>Along with great defense, the Gauchos performed incredibly on offense with a 10-run seventh inning. Freshman outfielder Kristen Clark continued to show her young talent as she led the way with three hits and three RBI’s.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had another strong defensive outing in their rematch with UNI on Saturday morning. They would again beat Northern Iowa, but this time it was no easy win, taking eight innings to put away the Panthers.</p>\n<p>Pingree was the starter and the finisher in the game, earning her third win while allowing only two runs in eight innings. Santa Barbara found itself down 2-0 in the bottom of the seventh inning, but was able to capitalize in clutch time by evening the score with a double from freshman infielder Emily Brucelas. Then in the eighth inning, senior infielder Kathryn Pilpil would seal the deal with a walk-off single into left scoring the runner from third.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara headed into its fourth game with a tournament record of 3-0, ready to take on No. 10 Florida State, the tournament’s host. The Gauchos dropped this matchup 5-2 as the Seminoles improved their record to 13-1. This was Florida State’s 13th straight win with the help of pitcher Lacey Waldrop, who carries a microscopic ERA of .50. Waldrop picked up her seventh win as she handled the Santa Barbara offense.</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos will be the Louisville Slugger Invitational, which begins Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Anna  Kodelashvili of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54157\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-have-successful-weekend-in-florida/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54157\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-have-successful-weekend-in-florida/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-have-successful-weekend-in-florida/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-have-successful-weekend-in-florida/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-24/gauchos-have-successful-weekend-in-florida/","id":1036,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[1035,1034,1033],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Overpower Cal Lutheran in Largest Victory in Program History","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-B-161214-DustinHarris-12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-B-161214-DustinHarris-12-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The men's basketball team had a triumphant homecoming on Tuesday in which they set the school-record with a 56 point win, all without star guard Max Heidegger.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_75299\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-B-161214-DustinHarris-12-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2017837394\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"84905\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75299\" data-attachment-id=\"75299\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-14/gauchos-overpower-cal-lutheran-in-largest-victory-in-program-history/ami-lakoju-retrieves-a-rebound-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-B-161214-DustinHarris-12-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C2400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,2400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Ami Lakoju retrieves a rebound.

It didn’t take long for McLaughlin to get in on the scoring action, as he splashed a three to put the Gauchos up 10-0 after only a minute and a half of action.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sow glowed in his first game at the Thunderdome, as he finished with 15 points and a game-high 83 percent shooting from the field in a mere 14 minutes of playing time. After a half of play, Sow was 4-4 on shooting with 13 points. The Prolific Prep alum added seven boards during the short start, including five rebounds in the first half.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the floor, the Kingsmen were held to just 15.7 percent from the field as their shooting struggles plagued them throughout the night. Cal Lu posted just 21 points from field goals while they knocked down a cold 3 of 25 from three-point range.</p>\n<p>“We have to be a lockdown defensive team for us to be successful,” Head Coach Joe Pasternack expressed postgame. “My whole focus is to prepare our team to give incredible effort defensively on every single possession; the rest will take care of itself. I think we did that tonight.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos continued to pile it on with a 15-2 scoring run as UCSB led 31-8 with 10 minutes to play in the first half. Junior guard Christian Terrell and sophomore captain Devearl Ramsey spearheaded the Gaucho attack from the backcourt as the duo shot 5-7 in the first half. Terrell finished with a perfect shooting night, going 4-4 from the field while adding eight points and three steals in the process.</p>\n<p>UCSB finished off the half with an 8-2 run as Gauchos were on top 50-15 at the break. Senior forward Ami Lakoju powered the ’Chos in the final minutes of the half as he recorded 10 points in five minutes before the whistle.</p>\n<p>“I’m here to help the team and do what I can,” Lakoju stated. “I’m here to help out, and if they want to keep going to me, I’m going to put the ball up … We have help coming off the bench, and moving forward we don’t have to rely on the starting five.”</p>\n<p>The big men off the bench put on a show for the home crowd as Lakoju posted a game-high 16 points while his frontcourt counterpart, sophomore Robinson Idehen, added 10 points. Idehen and Amadou Sow combined for six blocks in the post as each of them contributed three apiece.</p>\n<p>“We really had to get the ball inside. I thought we had a big size advantage,” Pasternack asserted about his game plan. “We had to move the ball. The ball was too stagnant; we were dribbling too much against North Dakota State.”</p>\n<p>Thirsty to stack the stat sheet, the Gauchos attack featured more of the same offensive success with different faces producing. 12 out of 13 Gauchos scored a basket as the bench delivered a monstrous 53-point performance. None of the five starters played more than five minutes in the second half, as Pasternack valued the opportunity to develop the newcomers with extra playing time.</p>\n<p>“All of our guys have worked so hard in practice each day to prepare themselves,” Coach Pasternack said. “To have a deeper team really helps us. We don’t have to play 35 minutes a game like we did last year … It’s huge to be able to go 10 deep; I think it’s really going to be beneficial when we get to March.”</p>\n<p>The moment of the game came at the end of the contest when sophomore walk-on Scotty Harris contributed two baskets in the final four-minute frame as he got his first live-game court time as a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>Following the scoring spree, UCSB looks to keep the attack sharp as the 1-2 Montana State Bobcats stroll into town on Saturday afternoon at 2 p.m. to take on the 2-1 Gauchos at the Thunderdome.</p><div

Redshirt Junior Guard Coco Miller also added two three’s to prevent the Grand Canyon defense from doubling Anugwom.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heading into this game, the Gauchos were still trying to find an identity offensively as they have struggled to score consistently. In the second quarter, the squad was able to drop 28 points through an emphasis of balanced scoring.

As the second quarter wrapped up, UCSB was able to outscore the Lopes by 13 points, giving them a 19-point lead heading into halftime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They would cool off offensively in the third, however, as they were only able to score 10 points in the period. Grand Canyon made it a point of emphasis to pressure the ball more to start the second half which led to easy baskets on the other end. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the common trends throughout the early season is that the squad has been unable to respond when something does not go their way in the game. Despite the increased pressure, Santa Barbara continued to remain aggressive and was undeterred when they faced adversity for the first time in the game. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grand Canyon was able to find its rhythm however, particularly in the fourth quarter as the team scored 22 points and cut their deficit to just 11 points by the end of the game. They were led by senior center Sharon Miller who had 12 points on the night, while also going 8-for-8 from the free throw line. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bruening did a terrific job for the Gauchos as she was able to limit the post touches for Miller which prevented her from making more of an impact offensively. With her confidence growing every game, she will surely be one of the team’s best players by the end of the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller has also been fantastic in the past few games as she has not only been making an impact offensively with her jumpshot but also has provided veteran leadership for the young group. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the season has gone on, UCSB has started to play with more chemistry which has led to more fluidity on both ends of the floor. Statistically, they have been able to improve their field goal percentage as a result of an increase in communication on the floor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson, it is very encouraging to see the team continue to fight and remain locked in despite their disappointing start to the season.
