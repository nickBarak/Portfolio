The 10 total points are actually worse than Cal Poly’s 2016 point total, where the team had 11.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs have not been back to the playoffs since 2015 and appear to have a lot of work to do in order to get back.</p>\n<p>Despite the final score, it was actually freshman Rodney Michael who opened up the scoring for the game, giving the Gauchos the early 1-0 lead on a 15 yard shot from the top of the box.</p>\n<p>The goal was Michael’s eighth on the season, increasing his team lead in goals on the year. Michael’s scoring shot was the first UCSB since the Oct. 18 match against Sacramento State where Michael again scored all two goals of the match for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were offensively active, taking six shots in the first half, but only Michael’s was able to find the net.</p>\n<p>The play between the two teams was back and forth during the first half, much like the last meeting between the two familiar clubs.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the 43rd minute when sophomore Kenneth Higgins received a heads-up pass from teammate Jared Pressley and took a shot that went just to the left of a diving Alan Carrillo.</p>\n<p>The point was not only the Mustang’s first of the match, but it was also Higgins’ first goal of the season and the equalizer left it all even at halftime, 1-1.</p>\n<p>If the story at the end of the first half was yet another Cal Poly &amp; UCSB draw, the Mustangs were quick to change that as less than four minutes from the beginning of the second half, senior Adam Olsen found himself at the far post when the ball deflected towards him and the senior was able to tap the ball into the net for the lead, 2-1.</p>\n<p>Olsen’s mark on the match was not left at the eventual game-winning goal, as the senior lobbed a high arcing pass to a waiting Kaba Alkebulan in the 51st minute, who ran past a defender to find himself alone in the box, who headed it past Carrillo, putting Cal Poly ahead 3-1. It was Jared Pressley who scored the final goal of the match in the 65th minute as the Mustangs would go on to win 4-1.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While the Gauchos did not find themselves ready to play their last minutes of the 2017 regular season, they did find themselves looking to make the Blue-Green Rivalry their last chance to get some momentum headed into the playoffs.</p>\n<p>Throughout the month of October, UCSB has only won two games out of the eight they have played. The team has split the remaining matches between three losses and three ties.</p>\n<p>The first round of the Big West Conference Tournament will begin on Wednesday, November 1 where the number two seeded UCSB Gauchos of the North Division will host the number three seeded UC Riverside Highlanders of the South Division.</p>\n<p>In their only match of the regular season, the Gauchos hosted the Highlanders and subsequently won the match 3-1.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79369\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-drop-season-finale-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly-earn-no-2-seed-for-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79369\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-drop-season-finale-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly-earn-no-2-seed-for-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-drop-season-finale-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly-earn-no-2-seed-for-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-drop-season-finale-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly-earn-no-2-seed-for-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-drop-season-finale-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly-earn-no-2-seed-for-big-west-tournament/","id":1388,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1387,1386,1385],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez","biography":"Not available","articles":[45,52,64,67,68,69,71,1111,1132,1136,1160,1162,1165,1169,1170,1172,1197,1201,1202,1204,1205,1377,1380,1383,1388,1399,1497,1921,3342,4097,4106,4111,4266,4268,4270,4273,4274,4282,4287,4819,4822,4828,4889,4891,4892,4893],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Women’s Soccer Ends Season With 1-1 Tie Versus Blue-Green Rival Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/HallieBrown_WSoc_vsUCI-20171001-08-print.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/HallieBrown_WSoc_vsUCI-20171001-08-print.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos finish the season with a 6-8-5 overall, 2-4-2 conference record.

The defender knocked in her first goal of the year off of Colby Parker’s corner kick, and the moment was even more special as it was her last game as a Gaucho.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rest of the first half played out evenly for both sides, although UCSB did get off many more shots than Cal Poly a number of quality shots for both squads were pretty equal and the goalkeepers for both squads had to make multiple saves to keep their teams alive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The physical nature of the Blue-Green rivalry also was present in the first half, even if it was the Gauchos who were often the aggressors (they doubled Cal Poly’s foul count in the first half 8-4) both squads had plenty of hard challenges that contributed to the chippy atmosphere.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mustangs must have taken the physicality to heart as they came out guns blazing in the second half, and found the mark in the 47th minute of the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again it was a senior scoring in her last game, except this time it was midfielder Emily Hansen who knocked in the game-tying goal after Brittney Rogers couldn’t corral a Cal Poly freekick.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB dominated the half, however, tallying seven shots to Cal Poly’s one the Gauchos were operating at a high level on the offensive end for the last 40 minutes of the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They weren’t able to put one shot past Mustang goalkeeper Sophie Brown however as the sophomore had a stellar half, stopping four shots in the half itself and totaling nine on the day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The saves didn’t seem to affect the Gauchos who continued to attack the Cal Poly goal until the very last minute of regulation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going into the first overtime not much changed for the Gauchos while Cal Poly brought three pairs of fresh legs in. It was UCSB who looked like they had a boost of energy however as they put three shots on goals in the first overtime period, and if not for the heroics of Brown they almost certainly would have ended up winning the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The keeper made the three saves, however, and neither team took a shot in the second overtime period leading to the 1-1 tie.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this wasn’t the result the Gauchos hoped for coming into their season finale, the game actually provided a lot of positives going into the offseason. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The play of Christine Maurer continues to be a shining spot as the freshman showed countless times this year that she has potential to be a top player in the league in the coming years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The great defense that the team played on Sunday also was emblematic of how good UCSB has been defensively to end the year. Although the result wasn’t everything the Gauchos wanted it to be, they played hard and played great soccer, which fittingly is a good analogy for how the 2017-18 season went.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

The trio combined for three of UCSB’s five shots in the half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ best opportunity in the first period was a corner kick in the 10th minute as Schornstein sent a header towards the back of the net only to be snagged by Long Beach goalkeeper Ashton McKeown.</p>\n<p>McKeown has been a force behind goal for the 49ers, leading the Big West with a save percentage of .877. The junior from Huntington Beach, CA has recorded ten saves in her three previous Big West appearances, adding five more in Sunday’s contest.</p>\n<p>“It was a combination of [missed scores] and [a] very good goal keeper [at] play in today’s match,” Stumpf said. “We had one good look at it [in the first half] but [McKeown] made one great save.”</p>\n<p>Despite an aggressive 45 minutes of controlling possession 59 to 41, Santa Barbara went into halftime locked in a 0-0 gridlock.</p>\n<p>“We took the ball away from them and created more chances than [Long Beach] did, but just didn’t stick one away,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos kept an aggressive tone starting the second period as two yellow cards were issued in the first 10 minutes to junior defender Sydney Fuertes and junior midfielder Sara Feder.</p>\n<p>In the 52nd minute Feder responded on the offensive end, cutting past the 49er defensive line and sending a kick from 15 yards out, but it ricocheted out of bounds.</p>\n<p>Still locked at zero, the Gauchos had another chance in the 67th minute from sophomore defender Kate Shoemaker. Schornstein found Shoemaker off a free kick and Shoemaker headed the ball just to the left of the net. A diving save, however, from the 49ers’ McKeown kept her team alive and the match at a stalemate.</p>\n<p>The game ultimately came down to the 76th minute as Long Beach State’s Vania Robles moved her way into the box and popped the ball over the UCSB backline for sophomore forward Ashley Gonzalez.</p>\n<p>Although Gonzalez was met at goal by junior goalkeeper Jacq Caginia, a quick in-and-out move from the reigning Big West Freshman of the Year sent the ball down the line to the left corner of the net. This gave the 49ers a late 1-0 edge with 15 minutes remaining in regulation.</p>\n<p>“We made one mistake in the back and paid a massive price for it,” Stumpf said. “Against a good team like Long Beach you have to play mistake free and unfortunately we just didn’t do it.”</p>\n<p>Gonzalez has racked in six total goals on the year. The Ontario, CA native has been the X-factor since the start of the Big West for Long Beach, burying a game-winning overtime goal on Oct. 4 against defending Big West champions Cal State Fullerton. Gonzalez’s exceptional conference play also earned her the Big West Player of the Week award.</p>\n<p>As the Gauchos move to an even .500 in conference, junior Sydney Fuertes believes there are positives to take out of this tough match and this young team.</p>\n<p>“We definitely executed our game plan [today] all but finishing,” Fuertes said. “We dominated possession in the first and second half, but it was just a matter of someone making a play … our team worked till the end and now we know to put games away early.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos renew their blue-green rivalry against Cal Poly this Thursday.  The match will take place at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

So, in the end, it just comes down to personnel and the function of forwards [not making plays quick enough and passing] and playing as forwards,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>UCSB is now 6-6-5 and 4-2-3 in the Big West, while Sac. St. sits at 8-7-2, 4-3-2. Santa Barbara came into the match second in the division with 14 points, while Sac St. was third with 13.</p>\n<p>Following Wednesday’s match, no changes took place in the North Division standings as the Gaucho-Hornet stalemate led to one point for both teams, leaving UCSB in second (15 points) and Sac St. in third (14 points), however, UC Davis was crowned the Big West North Division champion after its 2-1 victory over Cal Poly on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The game whistle sounded and both teams were off to a booming start. The Sac State Hornets were the first to strike as Gaucho freshman keeper saved an open shot on goal. This would be the first of only two on target shots the Hornets had all night.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos then peppered in a couple shot of their own, but besides foul trouble from both ends, the rest of the first half remained pretty stagnant regardless of all the team substitutions. Both teams would end up with a combined total of 33 infractions on the night.</p>\n<p>A standout moment in regulation, was when a Red Card was given to the Gaucho bench in the 68<sup>th</sup> minute, in response to their passionate reaction to what the team felt was a no call.</p>\n<p>As for the second half of play, UCSB went ahead and took reign of possession. This eventually proved to be a recurring theme for the home side as it seemed every following counterattack was called offside as well leading to the Gauchos seventh overtime match of the season, the fourth that went into OT tied 0-0.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were instantly aggressive in the opening minutes of the first OT period, attempting three corner kicks in a row, but to no avail. There was only one shot attempted in the second OT period for either team, and that shot was by senior Kim.</p>\n<p>The lack of playmaking ability from the midfield was prevalent as all key passes from half field just seemed to be swallowed up by the Hornet defensive line. In the end, the end of the game had arrived and both teams settled for the draw.</p>\n<p>“Our forwards are young; they work hard and have loads of talent. But passing is sometimes an afterthought for them. So when they finally get into that situation, it’s too late, which is why we need a guy that can get up the field and make those passes,” Vom Steeg said. “Subsequently, it’s forward passing to forward so these passes end up being too short, too far or behind. Which is when the goalie comes running up at you and you won’t have enough time to run around him or chip the ball over.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this was the case for both teams. Regardless of all the counterattacks and offside calls, neither side was able to pull the trigger and earn the winning goal. Whether it was nerves or just quality defense on both ends, it was a great showing no doubt.</p>\n<p>Senior night was also upon us and some of the Gauchos were about to play their final regular season home game of the season. Players being honored recognized for their contribution to the team included: seniors Seo-In Kim, Omar Montalvo, Josue Salgado, Alex Liua, and Randy Mendoza. Each of these players started or were subbed throughout the match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now head away for their last game of the season as they face Cal Poly in the last installment of this year’s Blue Green men’s soccer rivalry beginning at 7 p.m. on Saturday, October 28 at Alex G. Spanos Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79344\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79344\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/","id":1386,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1385,1384,1383],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
