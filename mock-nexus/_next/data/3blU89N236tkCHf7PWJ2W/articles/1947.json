between the Associated Students (A.S.) Department of Public Worms, the A.S. Food Bank and the UC Santa Barbara Sustainability Internship Program and trains students in practices that address the social, economic and environmental aspects of sustainability, according to Katie Maynard, advisor of the Edible Campus Program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the great things about a farm is it gives students an opportunity to have a hands-on connection with the natural environment and where their food comes from. Sometimes, the changes in a student’s life can be as simple as getting a better appreciation for the work that goes into creating their food,” Maynard said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opening of the farm, located on West Campus at the corner of El Colegio and Storke Road, featured a variety of booths to educate visitors on sustainability and composting, local wildlife in the area as well as providing activities for children, such as pot-painting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, Jack Johnson, singer-songwriter and UCSB alumnus, performed at the opening, singing several of his most popular songs, including “Banana Pancakes,” as well as an original song about composting to fit the theme of the event. Johnson and his wife Kim are both major donors to the project and have visited the farm to help out and check on its progress several times in the past four years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funding for the farm came from the UC Global Food Initiative, A.S. Coastal Fund, the Green Initiative Fund, the Food Security &amp; Basic Needs Taskforce, the Healthy Campus Network and the Fund for Santa Barbara Youth Making Change Board, among others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a speech at the grand opening, Chancellor Henry T. Yang emphasized that the farm will contribute to other sustainable food practices already established at UCSB and in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are working to ensure that all students have access to healthy and sustainable foods </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">⁠—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from growing food here on campus to campus food pantries [like] Associated Students Food Bank and Miramar Food Pantry to help[ing] students register for CalFresh,” Yang said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maynard said that the farm will continue to grow in the future, with plans for a total of 37 raised planter beds, ranging from 16 to 20 feet high. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Edible Campus Program is also planning on working with other departments on campus for projects using the farm, according to Maynard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[We’re] working with Dr. Chandra Krintz from the computer science department. And we’re actually going to be putting a weather station …  and collecting data that through various meters throughout the farm that computer science students can use to then make recommendations about how we may change our farming practices.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 7</em><em> of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-90472\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">One major focus of the event was the resilience of the native and indigenous communities.<em> Ida Kazerani/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was the first year that the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) was responsible for planning this event. American Indian Student Association (AISA) EOP peer mentor Jeike Meijer, a fourth-year global studies and feminist studies double major, worked with another peer mentor to plan the celebration. Meijer served as the Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs for the 2018-2019 school year and was the first Native American to serve as an Associated Students executive at UCSB — a focal point of her campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Through 500 years of colonialism and a tribal genocide, my people are supposed to be gone, but I’m still here, so [Indigenous Peoples’ Day] stands to me as resilience and I remember my ancestors, my family and how much they fought so that I can be here,” Meijer explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One major focus of the celebration was the resilience of the native and indigenous communities, which attendees touched on by sharing stories from their personal histories. Allison Dutra, a second-year zoology major who attended the event, found the emphasis on family origins particularly impactful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it was really cool how [attendees] touched on their roots, the efforts that they’re putting in today to help kind of restore [what] once was here,” Dutra said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One attendee used their time to speak out against Chancellor Henry Yang’s involvement with the Thirty Meter Telescope Project, currently in construction on Mauna Kea on the big island of Hawaii – a sacred ground for native Hawaiians. Yang currently serves as the chair of the telescope’s board of governors; his role sparked backlash from UCSB students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other AISA members touched on the importance of UCSB students being aware of the past Chumash roots of the campus. Linda Murray, an alumna who was involved with AISA during her time at UCSB, believes that UCSB students have a responsibility to honor the Chumash. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We respect [the Chumash] and their culture and know that they’re still here. Natives are not in the past tense — we’re alive and nationally have networks,” Murray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer echoed this sentiment, acknowledging that the role of academia on campus translates to a heightened responsibility to learn about the realities of indigenous history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“By recognizing Indigenous Peoples’ Day, we’re taking in knowledge, we’re learning and hopefully providing [information] for future generations to say that Columbus Day isn’t okay anymore,” Meijer explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, the I.V. Community Services District began acknowledging the Chumash people’s roots to I.V. at the beginning of each meeting with a statement meant to “pay our respects to the Chumash elders, past, present  and future, who call this place, Anisq’Oyo, the land that Isla Vista sits upon, their home.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To many in attendance, an important part of the celebration was to recognize the historical inaccuracies in regards to indigenous people, to correct this history and to understand their right to occupy spaces on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The history [needs to] be written correctly for students to know before they get to the university,” Murray said. “It’s really important for us to exchange with each other and to feel that we also belong here when we are actually the original descendants.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

addition of two new programs, UC San Diego and Cal State Bakersfield, to the league, which is now up to 11 total teams.</p>\n<p>While this is good news for both universities and the commissioner of the Big West, Dennis Farrell, there is a question of how this will affect UCSB.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, this was a huge move for UCSD. In 2010, the school failed to get membership into the Big West because students rejected a referendum to increase student fees to support the athletics program.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>However, in May of 2016, a referendum along the same lines passed, setting the stage for the Tritons to become a D-I program.</p>\n<p>Initially voted down by the Big West members in April of this year, losing the vote 5-4, UCSD was able to get in on the second try with a 9-0 vote.</p>\n<p>UCSD will join the conference in the 2020 season and will then begin a four-year reclassification period, which means they can’t compete for championships due to them jumping from D-II to D-I.

Currently, apart of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), CSUB has to travel a lot to face their conference opponents such as schools like New Mexico State, Seattle University, Chicago State, Utah Valley and more that were just out of their way.</p>\n<p>Nine of the teams in the Big West Conference are all in the same state, California, which will help them save money on travel costs.</p>\n<p>Since it is already a D-I program, CSUB will become an official Big West member in all sports in 2020.</p>\n<p>UCSD and CSUB will probably find a very happy life in the Big West just as UC Davis did when it joined back in 2003.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79939\" style=\"width: 291px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1821621230\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79937\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79939\" data-attachment-id=\"79939\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/how-do-the-latest-big-west-changes-impact-ucsb/bigwestmap/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap.png?fit=600%2C1700&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,1700\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"bigwestmap\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap.png?fit=88%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap.png?fit=361%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-79939\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap-361x1024.png?resize=281%2C797\" alt=\"\" width=\"281\" height=\"797\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap.png?resize=361%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 361w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap.png?resize=88%2C250&amp;ssl=1 88w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79939\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>However, the bigger question is how will this affect UCSB and the sports programs found here on campus?</p>\n<p>The short answer: This is not a move that will help UCSB in any way.</p>\n<p>While the two schools might be able to help the Gauchos in smaller sports such as men’s water polo or men’s volleyball, they won’t be a big boost to the sports most fans and alums care about: soccer, baseball and basketball.</p>\n<p>CSUB has been improving in men’s basketball, winning the WAC title the last two seasons and making a decent run in the NIT last year, but it’s not a school that the Gauchos will benefit from having on their schedule — not yet.</p>\n<p>If they continue the trend, then maybe down the line this could become a great game that will draw many fans, but as of right now, I doubt UCSB students will be geared up to go to a CSUB game.</p>\n<p>Again, CSUB is not a bad addition that will hurt UCSB due to its winning ways the past few years, but its jump to the Big West will also show if those winning seasons were due to them being in a less competitive conference or not.</p>\n<p>As for UCSD, they will be an RPI anchor for years until they can get their program up to D-I competitiveness. While not being an anchor for the first years during their reclassification period, the Tritons will have a tough time before they get their program to a competitive level.</p>\n<p>For comparison reasons, UC Davis barely won their first Big West Tournament title this past season and while they are in the right direction, before last season they only had one winning campaign in their first 12 years of Division-I status.</p>\n<p>These two additions will also not move the conference up the RPI ladder as a whole either.</p>\n<p>In baseball, the Gauchos are already in a peculiar position in that if they don’t win their conference, then their road to a postseason regional match is already up in the air.</p>\n<p>It comes down to who they schedule and beat in non-conference play because, as it stands, the Big West conference is not seen as deserving of more than one team sent to the postseason.</p>\n<p>It has routinely sent more than one team in the past, but it has not always been easy and in fact, the Gauchos missed the postseason in despite going 34-17-1 because their RPI was not up to snuff.</p>\n<p>Again, CSUB does not help this problem. It also doesn’t help that last year’s conference RPI has the Big West in eighth while the WAC was in 25.</p>\n<p>UCSD has been a big factor in D-II college baseball, but a move to D-I will be a difficult one, and while some teams have managed to build a contender in a short amount of time, it will still be a tough road for the Tritons.</p>\n<p>The same problem goes for other big sports such as soccer.</p>\n<p>The problem with adding CSUB isn’t that you are adding a program that is horrible across the sports landscape, it’s that you’re adding another average team to a conference that could use a big name to help propel its status.</p>\n<p>As it stands right now, the addition of these two teams doesn’t help UCSB. But, if down the line CSUB is able to continue their success in sports such as basketball, baseball, etc. and help renovate some of their stadiums, which it hopes to do with the money it saves, then maybe they could help get some more exposure for a conference primarily now made up of California teams.</p>\n<p>The same goes for UCSD once they become a full-fledged member.</p>\n<p>The bottom line for UCSB, however, is simple: it has to capitalize on this conference and start becoming the team that dominates it, especially in these bigger sports. For most successful mid-majors like Gonzaga in men’s basketball, they aren’t in tough conferences either, however, it’s the way they dominate their conference that gives them notoriety.</p>\n<p>The Big West, even with these two additions, is still a conference that can provide some quality teams. But if UCSB can become the team that dominates in year in and year out, then it won’t matter who is and who is not added.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 30</em><em>, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
