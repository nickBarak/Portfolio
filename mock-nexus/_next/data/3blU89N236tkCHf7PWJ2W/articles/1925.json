On Wednesday, workers represented by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME 3299) held their sixth strike in two years after the union filed <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-06/afscme-files-six-new-unfair-labor-practice-complaints-against-uc-plans-to-strike-nov-13/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573718186508000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE0IXQTx92iJhsPGSRrVXxo8SDUoQ\">six unfair labor practice complaints</a> against the UC in early November. A majority of the complaints addressed the UC’s alleged use of “secretive” contracts to outsource labor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the news of a policy aimed to internalize a majority of the UC’s workforce, AFSCME is not yet convinced this policy will clear the air on the alleged workforce offenses the UC has committed in the past. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over the last several years, thousands of UC service and patient care workers have stood together to expose the university’s unfair, unsafe and often illegal outsourcing of UC jobs. Now, after years of dismissing the problem and the racialized inequality it creates, the Board of Regents is finally acknowledging the need to change course,” the union said in a statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A “policy” isn’t worth the paper its [sic] printed on unless it is actually enforced… UC’s abysmal track record makes clear that only state legislation or binding contract language can deliver the accountability that’s needed to uplift UC’s most vulnerable low wage workers and to stop the university from outsourcing more jobs,” the union continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/nov19/g2attach.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573719471565000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFKJ1q3jBL_aDWK9Uf3jxQEf96lZw\">policy</a> would cover all campuses and affect a substantial amount of contractible services, such as custodial, food, healthcare and transportation services. No official date for the policy’s implementation has been set, but guidelines to roll out the policy would be established “no later” than Jan. 31, 2020, according to the policy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the umbrella of the new policy, the UC is allotted few instances in which outsourced labor will be permitted: if the services are needed in an emergency, if the UC is unable to provide the required equipment or personnel internally, if the services are related to property transactions, if the services would be more convenient to contract out or if services provided by “registry personnel in clinical operations” are not sufficient enough to respond to “staffing needs,” according to the policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The policy also offers contracted workers, who often work for lower wages and with fewer benefits, an opportunity to be adopted by the UC as university employees if the requirements for their employment are met. In turn, the “in-sourcing” of contracted employees will provide them with the full wages and salaries offered by the UC, according to the policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Individuals employed by service contractors who have provided those services to the University on a continuous basis for 12 months or more may request to be converted to University employment,” the policy continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the intake of contracted workers, employees under “covered services” — contracted services that are qualified to remain outsourced — are mandated by the new policy to be provided with “wages and benefits that are equivalent to the University wages and benefits provided to University employees performing the same work,” the policy read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, according to the policy, should “covered services” displace university employees, the university is required to open another position of a similar nature, which must “be in the same bargaining unit and at the same campus, medical center, or Laboratory” and provide matching wages and benefits corresponding to the displaced position.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, the new policy is expected to incur roughly an additional $108 million in costs for the UC, as stated at the meeting; the number was calculated by factoring in the cost of supplementing contracted work for insourced work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent Richard Leib commented on the policy at Wednesday’s Governance Committee meeting, predicting that the UC, as the third largest employer in California, may encounter difficulty implementing the policy as “there are certain administrative tasks that are going to make it difficult for our campuses who are under a lot of other pressures.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, he maintained that implementing the policy will better reflect the values of the UC and those who work for it.“This is the right thing to do,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the prospect for better employment opportunities, wages and benefits through the policy, Todd Stenhouse, communication director for AFSCME, said the union was still doubtful. Stenhouse said three bills passed through the California Legislature between 2015 and 2017 — SB 574, 959and 376 — all of which attempted to “ensure commensurate pay between contractors and employees who do the same job.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC “very publicly and vocally” lobbied to kill the three bills, all of which were vetoed by Governor Jerry Brown, Stenhouse said. Decisions like these pose a significant threat to employees, he said, especially those where financial insecurity constantly looms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These are not individuals that can afford to say, ‘Hey, you know, I’m good without a day’s pay,’” Stenhouse said. “These are people that don’t make a lot of money as it is. They see the pain and the harm and the insecurity that these practices have allowed to fester.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Stenhouse sees the policy as a sign of “progress” to AFSCME, the new policy “is hardly a finish line.” Stenhouse wants to see the UC keep its word and carry out on procedures that have been long overdue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a matter of concern across the state. We’re talking about communities across California. We’re talking about thousands of very vulnerable workers who are effectively doing the same jobs in many cases, full time, in many cases for years on end,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A first-class university does not have second-class workers. It is certainly high time for the University of California to not only talk the talk but to walk the walk.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Update [Nov. 15, 5:50 p.m.]: This article has been updated to include information about the full Regents’ vote on Thursday. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

In 2011 and 2015, UCSB received the less prestigious Gold-level distinction, according to the League. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amelia Neptune, a representative from the League of American Bicyclists, said in an email to the Nexus that there were “a few weaknesses” from UCSB’s 2015 application, which is why the university was not awarded a Platinum distinction before. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[There was] </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the lack of bike share at the time (there was a program but it had five bikes total, as opposed to the 650-bike HOPR program that now exists) and the poor quality of many of the bike racks on campus, which have been upgraded or are still in the process of being upgraded and/or expanded,” Neptune said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The significant changes made over the last few years, including the addition of new biking paths and bike parking spots, led to UCSB achieving the new award, Neptune said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A major factor in UCSB earning Platinum this year [is] the outcomes they were able to show: 43% of students who live off campus use a bike to commute to campus, which is huge compared to what most schools see,” Neptune said. </span><b> </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the new improvements build upon the deep-rooted bike culture that has been present on campus for decades, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The presence of dedicated bike infrastructure, including 20,000 bike parking spots, 9 bike-only roundabouts, 3 bike-only underpasses, and the network of dedicated bike paths throughout the campus, [is] also a major factor [for the Platinum BFU designation].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jamey Wagner, manager of the Transportation Alternatives Program, said that UC Santa Barbara began to develop its bicycle system in the 1960s, stating that the campus has “continued bicycle infrastructure innovation for over 50 years” and that the A.S. Bike Shop has been in operation for over 45 years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wagner added that the HOPR Bike Share program, which launched at UCSB in 2018, has seen significant improvement since 2015, when UCSB was last assessed as a bike-friendly university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most recent data shows that, with the addition of hundreds of shareable bikes, the HOPR program now has 1000 semi-regular users, according to Wagner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, in the last four years, the UCSB Sustainability Program has been partnering with the A.S. Bike Committee to provide bike safety training and bike-lot clearing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student initiatives played the largest role [in achieving platinum status], this was aided by the diversity in spaces such as the Associated Students Bike Committee and the A.S. Bike Shop</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” Wagner explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neptune added that over the past year, the Sustainable Transportation Committee has been working on a master transportation plan for the campus, which includes improvements to bike infrastructure. This plan was included in UCSB’s application to become a bike-friendly university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new bike plan promises changes and improvements to infrastructure on campus and in I.V., Mo Lovegreen, director of sustainability on campus, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are still in the process of drafting this plan and it will take us the bulk of this academic year to complete it but the idea is that it would help AS BIKES identify areas that need improvement and provide a list of items that need to be addressed,” Lovegreen explained in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plan [looks] into the future and uses what has been thought of and creates what hasn’t been thought of.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91116\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91116\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/","id":1922,"author":{"id":54,"name":"Nidhi Satyagal"},"related":[1921,1920,1919],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

It calls on the UC to end the use of all Proposition 65 herbicide on the campus, and asks the university to “notify students, faculty, and staff before any synthetic herbicides are sprayed at UCSB and in surrounding areas, including location and time details.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the resolution many of the synthetic herbicides used by the UC </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">such as glyphosate, oryzalin and 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are considered by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer to be probable carcinogens, meaning long-term exposure to such chemicals could be detrimental to human health.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the resolution states there have been a considerable number of court cases in California ruled that glyphosate-based herbicides had caused cancer, referencing one where, in August 2018, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">San Francisco Superior Court jury in the Dewayne Johnson v. Monsanto case found that glyphosate-based herbicide exposure was responsible for the plaintiff’s terminal cancer.

A student can submit reports of sexual misconduct — anonymously or not — either online, over the phone, via email or in person; the office will then establish a case file and reach out to the student in order to explain how they can move forward with the case, Alvarez explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, that can only happen if the complainant responds to the office’s follow up, she emphasized, explaining that if students submit through an anonymous report and provide scarce information, it can severely limit the office’s ability to continue a case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes we just have a first name. Sometimes we just have very general information about what happened,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it seems that we have insufficient information, meaning not enough information to move forward with one of those response options, then we may proceed with closure. That doesn’t mean we can’t reopen [the case] when we receive new information in the future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alia Reynolds, president of Students Against Sexual Assault, emphasized to the panel and attendees that communication between the university and students needs to be open at all times “without students having to ask for that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think students need access and communication of this information continuously and constantly, versus sending out updates on everything that’s been done after the fact,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students pressed the panel for answers on what the university is going to do moving forward regarding the allegations against Sigma Pi.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You have answered [with] appropriate actions to take once the investigation is complete,” one student said. “With all due respect, I believe you still haven’t answered the question about what actions are being taken now against these fraternities.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miles Ashlock, acting associate dean and Office of Student Life (OSL) director, said that as soon as the OSL members heard of multiple allegations against fraternities in I.V., they held a meeting with the Interfraternity Council (IFC) to have a “long and very open dialogue about our very explicit concerns about the reports that we had received.” </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You have answered [with] appropriate actions to take once the investigation is complete… With all due respect, I believe you still haven’t answered the question about what actions are being taken now against these fraternities.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The IFC council made a decision immediately in that room… to create a self-imposed moratorium on social events. They originally imposed that for four days, and after that period they reassessed and decided to institute it indefinitely while ongoing discussion and internal rulemaking and conversations with the university administrators and advisors continued,” Ashlock said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn added that the IFC’s ban on parties was just one step in creating a safer environment for students, but another student pointed out that the moratorium would only cut off the liquor and leave the root cause ignored.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[We’re] saying we don’t want to have parties in these houses where people are going to be unsafe,” Klawunn said. “We believed that not having social events in those houses until we could put some safe steps into place was the right direction, and so that’s where we stand.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students voiced similar concerns about the university’s Rape Aggression Defense (R.A.D.) initiative, a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sexual assault defense training program offered through the UC Police Department</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. One student emphasized that getting to the underlying cause of the sexual assaults should be the university’s primary focus, rather than creating defense programs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It seems that the R.A.D. training is the only tangible outcome of what we’ve heard going on  campus, and it seems as though [it’s saying] ‘Let’s train women to defend themselves’ instead of ‘Let’s get to the root of the problem,’” the student said. “There’s a culture, there’s a problem with these criminals out there who are doing this who think it’s okay — and they’re getting away with it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eli Diaz, a second-year pre-economics and accounting major, also voiced his concerns over the language used in the timely warnings, particularly over the word “victim.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I heard Ariana, the Title IX officer, use the word ‘victim’ to refer to survivors and I feel like it’s been widely accepted that ‘victim’ isn’t the right word to use for people that are survivors of sexual violence. That felt like a strong disconnect, especially coming from someone that is from Title IX,” Diaz said in an interview with the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlock explained to forum attendees that the university must be careful when it comes to the use of the term “survivor” compared to “victim” or a neutral term such as “complainant.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we’re trying to hold someone accountable, it actually puts us in a less credible position to use the term ‘survivor.’ We are expected to be neutral, and if our investigators are making this linguistic assumption of the truth, it actually degrades the credibility of the case of the investigation when it goes before a hearing or a trial,” Ashlock said during the forum.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn further mentioned that in the immediate future, the Task Force for Safer Social Events — an ongoing project organized by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assistant Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katya Armistead, Associated Students President Alison Sir and Klawunn — will attempt to bring organizations from all over the community, including IFC, the OSL and the Isla Vista Community Services District, among others, to enact change for students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, one student believed that allowing IFC to take part in the task force could lead to a bias in the task force’s actions, referring back to the self-imposed moratorium. Armistead countered by stating that not including IFC would be counteractive to the change trying to be made. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Here’s the thing, if we’re going to make change, we’ve got to make change all over. And I think it can be really dangerous to not include any entity,” Armistead said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s important that we all work together as a community to make some really positive change. I’m not comfortable not having IFC nor any group on this task force. We </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have to</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> work together to make change.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
