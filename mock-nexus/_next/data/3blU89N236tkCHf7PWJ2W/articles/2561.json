Rather than admiring the images, however, students were staring at the ground.</p>\n<p>“Trump build the wall 2016,” “Obama is a Muslim” and “Muhammad fucked children” were among the slogans etched in chalk throughout campus, concentrated around the North Hall mural and South Hall, which holds the Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies. On the sidewalk in front of the Asian Resource Center was the phrase, “Currency is devalued.”</p>\n<p>UCSB maintenance staff washed much of the chalk away by Thursday afternoon, leaving only blurred marks and puddles, but many students remained troubled by the aggressive messages.</p>\n<p>“Given the climate, given what [Donald] Trump’s name has come to mean — that it’s connected to white supremacist groups with racism — I think that was intentionally targeting [minority students],” said Zachary King, a sociology graduate student.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69230\" style=\"width:

third-year economics major and a member of the Muslim Student Association (MSA), said the messages were an “isolated event” and warned of making a spectacle of the slogans.</p>\n<p>“When these slogans and messages popped up, I wasn’t very concerned about who was saying these things because, at the end of the day, it’s just a handful of folks who were trying to be edgy or incendiary,” Hakim said. “I think giving it too much attention is giving them exactly what they want.”</p>\n<p>Chalking sidewalks is a violation of the UCSB posting <a href=\"https://www.sa.ucsb.edu/osl/GreekLife/Policies/PostingAreas.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">policy</a> and can result in a maximum fine of $20 for a first offense.</p>\n<p>The university declined to comment on the markings, but university spokesperson Andrea Estrada said in an email that “because of the numerous posting violations that have occurred recently,” the Office of Student Life (OSL) will be sending an email to all students reminding them of the posting policy and letting them know where to report violations.</p>\n<p>Hakim said he was most worried about the marginalization of

mentalities aren’t tolerated and that they won’t persist.”</p>\n<p>The pro-Trump slogans first appeared earlier in the week, and several of them were edited, seemingly by other students, to say things like “Don’t Vote Trump 2016.”</p>\n<p>Late on Thursday, two students could be seen chalking a large “Black Lives Matter” mural on the sidewalk outside of the Humanities and Social Sciences

Monday for the After Tahrir: Egyptian Revolutionary Experiences and Future Visions conference in the McCune Conference Room.</p>\n<p>The four-day conference, organized by UCSB Professors Paul Amar, Sherene Seikaly and Laila Shereen Sakr, featured journalists, activists, artists and professors who spoke about the worldwide impact of the Revolution and how the Egyptian public continues to grapple with its implications. Many of the speakers have witnessed and experienced tragedy and violence, but use their narratives as tools to mobilize change and hold their oppressors accountable, whether through the media, art or memory.</p>\n<p>During Monday’s first panel, Egyptian visual artist Heba Amin spoke about how she and other Egyptians were “caught between hope and despair” during the time of the Revolution, which continues in an ongoing narrative.</p>\n<p>“The sense of possibility was real, or at least that’s how I remember it,” Amin said. “The past must become part of our present.”</p>\n<p>Amin also spoke about how technology was a key factor in the Revolution, as it allowed people to mobilize. Even though the Internet was shut down for almost a week, Amin said the “sentiment that people wanted to preserve their voice for eternity” persevered and started a worldwide discussion.</p>\n<p>The next panelist, curator Sarah Rifky, said the revolution was a way to show the government that its oppression and corruption cannot “fool” the people with “empty promises and sweet talk” and said “patience has its limit.”</p>\n<p>Although Rifky felt out of hope, support and imagination in some moments, she said art spaces pose a threat to the agenda of the government, and even art’s “imaginary conception of what it is and does” is extremely powerful.</p>\n<p>Each activist emphasized that the Egyptian Revolution led to a movement of “global solidarity” that can be related to movements all over the world such as Black Lives Matter and protests throughout Libya, Syria and Yemen.</p>\n<p>Journalist and blogger Wael Eskandar spoke about how one’s memory can serve as a weapon in the face of revolution.</p>\n<p>“The story needs to be told and there is more of the story to be told,” Eskandar said. “To be part of the Revolution is not primarily an Egyptian thing … the narrative is global.”</p>\n<p>Eskandar said the Revolution will endure through memories as a “moral stance.”</p>\n<p>“[The revolution] is neither dead, nor triumphant — it continues,” Eskandar said.</p>\n<p>According to Eskandar, many Egyptians “cannot forget the blood,” and memories of the protests will stay with them.</p>\n<p>“People feel a responsibility to what they’ve witnessed,” Eskandar said.</p>\n<p>Eskandar said Egyptians must use this memory to move forward and use it as a resource against those trying to rewrite the narrative of not only the Egyptian public, but also activists everywhere.</p>\n<p>“Today, there are pockets of resistance through memory,” Eskandar said. “It gives us the opportunity to be keepers of the flame.”</p>\n<p>Dalia Abd El Hameed, Head of the Gender Program at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, said she believes the sentiments of the revolution encourage solidarity.</p>\n<p>“[The narrative is about] confronting the silence together,” Hameed said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67704\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/conference-commemorates-fifth-anniversary-of-egyptian-revolution/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67704\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/conference-commemorates-fifth-anniversary-of-egyptian-revolution/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/conference-commemorates-fifth-anniversary-of-egyptian-revolution/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/conference-commemorates-fifth-anniversary-of-egyptian-revolution/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/conference-commemorates-fifth-anniversary-of-egyptian-revolution/","id":2558,"author":{"id":117,"name":"Effie Sklavenitis"},"related":[2557,2556,2555],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

It also allows UCPD to extend their reach across campus.</p>\n<p>“This is just one substation they have as part of that broader goal to break down those barriers in the communities they serve,” Metzger said.</p>\n<p>Olson said the office will also allow the department to extend its reach to the east area of campus. Much of UCPD’s focus is dedicated to the center of campus and the west side, which borders Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>The substation “definitely extends ourselves to that east campus because we don’t have a large presence unless we’re mobile, driving in that area,” Olson said, adding that the new office is “a place where we can literally hang our hat.”</p>\n<p>Heather Vest, fourth-year biology major who was walking out of the library Monday afternoon, said she had mixed feelings about the new substation.<br>\n“I’ve been here late at night and I’ve seen CSOs walking around, but it’s not like a lot of security really,” Vest said. “I feel pretty secure in the library — everything’s closed at night and there’s only one door open — but maybe other people don’t.”</p>\n<p>While Vest said she thought the new substation was a “cool” idea, she said seeing police on campus makes her think someone has committed a crime.</p>\n<p>“I feel like in the past I’ve seen UCPD on campus and it kind of makes people feel uncomfortable,” Vest said. “If someone’s driving around in a UCPD car, I know that something’s going on on campus or something’s wrong.”</p>\n<p>That view is one that Olson hopes will change with the new station. He said officers should be “accessible to the community, a visible presence” and that the new substation will help officers interact casually with students.</p>\n<p>Nicholas O’Dea, first-year physics major, was studying on a bench outside of the library on Monday. He said “knowing that [the new substation] is there makes me feel a bit more comfortable, knowing that there’s a CSO presence.”</p>\n<p>O’Dea said he understood that others might not want UCPD officers to continually patrol the library, but that the office itself adds a level of security.</p>\n<p>“I might feel a little uncomfortable if they had been patrolling around the library, something of that nature,” O’Dea said. “But that fact that there’s a room there, I don’t feel uncomfortable with that. If something happens in the library, I know I can turn to them.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, April 3 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nicholas-bogel-burroughs/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>test description</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:sdjklfh@kjasdn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69603\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucpd-to-create-new-office-in-library/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69603\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucpd-to-create-new-office-in-library/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucpd-to-create-new-office-in-library/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucpd-to-create-new-office-in-library/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucpd-to-create-new-office-in-library/","id":2560,"author":{"id":113,"name":"Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"},"related":[2559,2558,2557],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
