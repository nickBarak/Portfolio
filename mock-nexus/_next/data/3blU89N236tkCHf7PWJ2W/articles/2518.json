The five winners of $250 grants were Kappa Kappa Gamma, Greeks 4 Kids, Gamma Zeta Alpha, Dance Marathon and Swipe Out Hunger. The six winners of $500 grants were Queer Art Collective, Global Medical Brigades, Zeta Beta Tau, Street Health Outreach, Phi Delta Epsilon and Love Your Melon.</p>\n<p>Chris Pizzinat, deputy director of UCSB’s Office of Development, said those who participate in charity work should be honored for the example they set.</p>\n<p>“Philanthropy is not inherently ingrained in everyone, giving back is a largely learned value,” Pizzinat said. “It is emulated by those who feel an ownership of either an organization, a community or a cause. [These groups] are ones who teach these concepts to others through example. We are proud of what they are accomplishing and the impact of their work and we wish them much success.”</p>\n<p>According to Madison Frame, UCSB First co-chair and third-year psychology major, the campus organizations turned in applications describing their philanthropic work to be considered for the grant. Frame said UCSB First closely scrutinized applicant groups.</p>\n<p>“We chose the winners with the help of our committee, looking through all the applications and had a sort of rubric to help guide the committee members in evaluating how worthy the applicants were of receiving a grant,” Frame said. “The applications go through several checks with our advisors, with the committee and we even involved the Office of Student Life to ensure every component is accounted for.”</p>\n<p>Megan Jones, UCSB First co-chair and third-year communication and global studies double major, said UCSB First chose grant winners in part based on how they have expressed gratitude to donors in the past.</p>\n<p>“An interesting part of our rubric is based on the involvement the organization will have with the donors who gave these grants and are sponsoring in honor of their work,” Jones said. “It was something we really took into consideration because philanthropy gratitude is something we really emphasize.”</p>\n<p>Kelli Kaesberg, philanthropy chairperson of Kappa Kappa Gamma, said the sorority will most likely use the grant to plan a springtime philanthropy event for a charity that provides books for children in need.</p>\n<p>“We just had our fall and winter philanthropy events and since they were so successful, I think we’d be able to pull off a springtime philanthropy event where most of the proceeds would go to Reading is Fundamental,” Kaesberg said.</p>\n<p>Lynn Padlipsky, executive director of Dance Marathon and fourth-year biology major, said the grant will go toward next year’s Dance Marathon event.</p>\n<p>“The money we were given tonight will go to helping us start the planning for next year’s Dance Marathon event, where it will be bigger and better than this year’s,” Padlipsky said. “And all the money we raise then will go to Cottage Children’s Hospital.”</p>\n<p>Aimee Michelle, co-chair of Queer Art Collective and third-year CCS art and sociology double major, said she believes the organization was chosen for the grant due to its quickly growing presence on campus.</p>\n<p>“I think they chose us because we just started this organization this year,” Michelle said. “We already put on a $19,000 event and we’re already working with a lot of other groups even if we just started.”</p>\n<p>According to Xara Lopez, co-chair of Queer Art Collective, the money will be used to support queer students’ artistic expressions.</p>\n<p>“The money is going to go to supporting a lot of our new ventures,” Lopez said. “We specifically want to have spaces for queer students who express themselves artistically, so one of the main blocks we had was art supplies and those things cost a lot of money.”</p>\n<p>Caitie Mathias, president of Global Medical Brigades, said the organization will use its grant for medicine needed for its summer trip to Honduras.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to use this money to pay for medications to go to Honduras in the summer,” Mathias said.  “Medications cost a lot of money and we see about 1,200 patients while we’re there and it’s kind of scary when we’re close to running out of medications, so every bit counts.”</p>\n<p>Mathias said her organization “promotes self-sustainability” in the communities in which it works, which she believes is why it was chosen for a grant.</p>\n<p>“At the end of our clinic we have a public health lesson for all the people in the community,” Mathias said. “Adults have their own public lesson about nutrition, family-planning, STDs and then we have a health lesson for the children and we teach them about brushing their teeth and other health things. We’re there to make lasting changes.”</p>\n<p>Jennifer Linares, public relations manager for Love Your Melon, said the organization was surprised to receive a grant, being such a young organization.</p>\n<p>“We’re just starting off on campus and not a lot of people know about us,” Linares said. “We just started here in November but we’re not an official organization on campus until Spring Quarter, so getting the award feels really great that they acknowledged out work.”</p>\n<p>According to Fanzana Chapman, secretary for Love Your Melon, she believes the organization was selected because of the unique nature of its work providing hats for children with cancer.</p>\n<p>“I think one of the reasons why is we don’t hear very often [of] clubs that are supporting child cancer awareness,” Chapman said. “We do hear things like breast cancer or cancer awareness but for Love Your Melon, this will be the first club establishment here at UCSB. I think it’s something where you hear it’s unique and something that is here for the first time.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

id=\"caption-attachment-68960\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em> Maura Fox / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>David Williams arrived on the south lawn of Buchanan Hall Wednesday afternoon to ceremoniously light UCSB’s Eternal Flame — meant to be a symbol of peace between nations — but found the flame could not be lit.</p>\n<p>Williams, the initiator for the Rainbow Uprising of Consciousness Campaign, said he had asked Chancellor Henry T. Yang several weeks ago if he would fix the flame to remain lit through rain or wind, but arrived to find the flame already burning.</p>\n<p>“We came a little disappointed that we didn’t get to do the ceremony as we’d asked, but we were happy that it was lit,” Williams said. “I was confident it would stay lit.”</p>\n<p>However, as Williams honored the memorial on Wednesday, the flame continued to go out.</p>\n<p>Williams hopes students encourage the university to make “a mental shift” to prioritize the Eternal Flame.</p>\n<p>“Here’s the University of California, whose scientists have made all our nuclear weapons, and now the chancellor is even an electrical engineer, and I’m sure they can figure out how to keep a flame burning without the wind or the rain blowing it out,” Williams said. “But it’s just not important enough, and it won’t be important enough, I believe, until the students make it important enough.”</p>\n<p>Andrea Estrada, a spokesperson for UCSB, explained that in order for the flame to burn regularly, a new underground gas line and starter would need to be installed.</p>\n<p>“A number of fixes have been attempted in the past, but they haven’t addressed the main problems,” Estrada said, adding that it was important that the university find a “more permanent fix” before taking additional action.</p>\n<p>“It is being discussed and certainly we don’t want to have an eternal flame that’s not functioning,” Estrada said.</p>\n<p>Williams said although fixing the flame may be expensive, it is significant to community members and leaders who have worked to preserve the historic flame.</p>\n<p>If the flame is not fixed, “it’s going to be disappointing for a lot of people,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>If the flame is eventually lit, it will be carried in the Annual Global Peace Walk from Taos, N.M. to Santa Fe. It will then be carried in the Rainbow Uprising of Consciousness Peace March in summer where it will travel from New York City to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia to The White House.</p>\n<p>Williams, who called himself a “peace movement activist and a spiritual practitioner” began the Rainbow Uprising of Consciousness Campaign in 1990 and has been passionate about keeping the Eternal Flame lit since the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The Eternal Flame monument was given as a gift to the university from the UCSB class of 1968.</p>\n<p>Williams stressed the importance of UCSB’s Eternal Flame and its extensive history, including its being lit in 1990 with the Hiroshima Peace Flame, a peace symbol after the end of World War II.</p>\n<p>“[That flame] was lit in the [1990s] as a prayer for peace that Hiroshima should never happen again anywhere in the world,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>“And then, they’ve kept that burning as an eternal flame ever since in Hiroshima,” he continued. “As far as I know, [UCSB] is the only place in the United States where a Hiroshima peace flame was installed on an outdoor public monument. That’s why it’s so important: it’s a symbol.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68984\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsbs-eternal-flame-goes-out-during-ceremonial-lighting-university-urged-to-fix-flame/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68984\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsbs-eternal-flame-goes-out-during-ceremonial-lighting-university-urged-to-fix-flame/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsbs-eternal-flame-goes-out-during-ceremonial-lighting-university-urged-to-fix-flame/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsbs-eternal-flame-goes-out-during-ceremonial-lighting-university-urged-to-fix-flame/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsbs-eternal-flame-goes-out-during-ceremonial-lighting-university-urged-to-fix-flame/","id":2517,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2516,2515,2514],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Alumni Program Helps Students Land Jobs","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Firsthand-Online.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Firsthand-Online.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB Alumni Mentorship Program (A.M.P.), powered by networking group Firsthand, is now on the UCSB campus to provide students with the opportunity to get jobs through alumni networking.

Senate met Wednesday to discuss the new Single Transferable Vote (STV) system that will be used in this spring’s senate elections in an effort to create more proportionate representation of the student body.</p>\n<p>In the STV system, students will vote for their on or off-campus and collegiate senate representatives through a ranking system designed to better reflect the desires of each constituency.  A YouTube video used to explain Single Transferable Voting to the Senators in the first quarter can be found <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8XOZJkozfI\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>Assistant Director of Technology Sean Lieberman spoke of the benefits of switching to the STV system.</p>\n<p>“In previous elections, it was possible that 60 percent of the vote goes to one party, 40 percent goes to the other when there are two major parties,” Lieberman said. “The issue with that is that the 60 percent would get 95 percent of the seats. In STV, in theory, it’s a more proportional representation at the same time, without having the minority 40 percent become the supermajority.”</p>\n<p>In response to a question about how the vote will be distributed, Lieberman said, “If you vote for someone and they get cut, and your second choice gets cut as well, then it [the vote] goes to your third choice, and so on.”</p>\n<p>“Once you get to the point where there are no ‘nexts’ available, then they’re gone,” Lieberman said, explaining that people who vote for candidates that are no longer eligible will not be counted.</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Jack Tannenbaum, proxy for off-campus senator Natalie Jordan, asked what would happen if a candidate was many voters’ second choice.</p>\n<p>“When we move up the list, should I not get all the votes that put me as their second?” Tannenbaum asked.</p>\n<p>Nawar Nemeh, second-year economics and political science double major, said a candidate who garnered many second-place votes “would get eliminated immediately.”</p>\n<p>“The only reason behind that would be that first choice votes are the most valuable,” Nemeh said. “When we’re looking at first choice votes, we’re looking at the most accurate representation of what students want to see on campus. That is a decision that we [Elections Committee] did not make and left for you to decide.”</p>\n<p>“A Resolution in Support of the Implementation of a Good Samaritan Policy within the Campus Regulations,” “A Bill to Reform Honoraria,” “A Bill to Add a Mental Health Coordinator in COSWB’s Legal Code” and “A Resolution to Create a Group Project to Establish a Political Economy Major at UCSB” were all sent to Campus Affairs.</p>\n<p>“A Resolution to Divest from the Republic of Turkey to End the Perpetuation of the Armenian Genocide” was sent to External Affairs.</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article stated incorrectly that Nawar Nemeh is an on-campus senator. Nemeh resigned from A.S. in February.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68626\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-26/a-s-senators-explain-new-voting-system-for-spring-senate-elections/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68626\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-26/a-s-senators-explain-new-voting-system-for-spring-senate-elections/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-26/a-s-senators-explain-new-voting-system-for-spring-senate-elections/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-26/a-s-senators-explain-new-voting-system-for-spring-senate-elections/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-26/a-s-senators-explain-new-voting-system-for-spring-senate-elections/","id":2516,"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez"},"related":[2515,2514,2513],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
