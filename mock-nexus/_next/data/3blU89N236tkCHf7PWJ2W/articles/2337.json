Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>According to the resolution, numerous students have been removed from housing due to their mental disabilities. The resolution reads that disability discrimination is “an issue that constantly looms over UCSB students” and calls for the alteration or removal of the “Personal Care” clause in the UCSB housing contract.</p>\n<p>The “Personal Care Clause,” located under the Personal Care section of the housing contract, states that “residents are responsible for their own self-care and personal needs.”</p>\n<p>“UCSB Residential and Community living claims to ‘value diversity and inclusivity,’ but actively removes/refuses students who are neuroatypical without alternative housing options, contributing to disability discrimination within housing, student housing insecurity, and poor mental health,” the resolution reads.</p>\n<p>The resolution was authored by Senator Alison Sir and Senator Anthony Pimentel and was developed and finalized on Jan. 23, according to Pimentel.</p>\n<p>“I felt a resolution was the most efficient solution to make a plan of action by creating a committee and working on this issue head on,” Sir said.</p>\n<p>She added that the students who brought the issue to her attention would like to remain anonymous due to the “extremity and sensitivity of this particular issue.”</p>\n<p>Pimentel said that the issue was first brought to Sir and she asked him to be the co-author. Students with a mental disability are part of a community that is oftentimes “overlooked,” Pimentel said.</p>\n<p>“When this type of mistreatment to a community occurs, I find it necessary and critical that, as a student leader, I do all that I can to hold the people responsible for their mistreatment to a community of students who need the most support,” he said.</p>\n<p>The resolution states that the “personal care” clause should be eliminated and a new clause dedicated to students with disabilities should be created.</p>\n<p>The Senate demands that UCSB Housing include a new clause dedicated to students with disabilities because “citing C.A.P.S. is not acceptable.”</p>\n<p>The UCSB Housing contract states that Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through 805-893-4411.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the contract states that C.A.P.S. offers a large range of services, including crisis intervention, individual and group counseling, psychological assessment, stress management and referrals to outside agencies.</p>\n<p>The Senate resolution, however, states that C.A.P.S. is prevented from “being an adequate source of relief for students with short- and long-term mental illnesses” because only a limited number of appointments can be provided for each student.</p>\n<p>The resolution adds that C.A.P.S. is “severely understaffed.”</p>\n<p>Sir said she and Pimentel are currently planning to have a meeting with C.A.P.S. to discuss the program and the concerns outlined in the resolution.</p>\n<p>The clause “provides much gray area for Housing and Residential Services to work with in illegally excluding mentally ill students from UCSB Housing,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>Currently, it is “considered reasonable” for UCSB Housing to remove or reject individuals who have a history of mental instability and who are not currently being treated to “mitigate the mental instability,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>On-campus housing is held to different standards than other landlord-tenant relationships as a government community-based housing entity.</p>\n<p>Pimentel and Sir will be holding a Housing Ad-Hoc Committee Feb. 2 in the Nati conference room from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. to discuss a plan combatting the Personal Care Clause, according to Pimentel.</p>\n<p>Interested students and the general public are invited to attend to share their own experiences or voice their opinions on this issue, Pimentel said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 1 of the Feb. 1 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Armada said he had seen an increase in membership since the TSA officially became a BCU.</p>\n<p>“It’s small now, but I’m hoping that their interest will keep growing,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We’re one of the only UCs who didn’t have a transfer organization as a part of the Associated Students… That was shocking to me considering how many transfer students are being accepted, and it’s only increasing each year,” he added.</p>\n<p>The previous board of the TSA had intended to make their organization an entity of A.S., but failed to do so due to a lack of guidance from Senate, according to Nielson.</p>\n<p>With the help of Maalizadeh and Ochoa, the TSA was able to draft the proposal and complete the internal paperwork needed.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the things we want to do is just advocate for resources. With transfers, there’s no centralized voice,” Maalizadeh said. “There’s only so much a single person can do, but there’s so much that an organized group can do.”</p>\n<p>Maalizadeh envisions the TSA using its position in A.S. not just to hold community events, but also to advocate for resources such as more tutoring services and a better transfer student orientation.</p>\n<p>The TSA plans to work with the Transfer Student Center (TSC) by collaborating on events and utilizing the resources provided by the center.</p>\n<p>“Right now, I am a Transfer Peer Educator at the TSC, and I felt a division with the two even though we are serving the same constituents,” Ochoa said. “Now, I hope having a TSC liaison with the TSA will create more of a bond and collaborative efforts.”</p>\n<p>All four authors of the resolution emphasized that they hope to see transfer students having a larger presence on campus now that they have adequate representation in A.S.</p>\n<p>“Transfers come from everywhere, but we all have the same common identity of being a transfer,” Maalizadeh said. “I want to make sure that when people go to UCSB as a transfer, they aren’t an afterthought.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg.4 of the Feb. 15 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Some lost friends and others were stranded south of the freeway closure, forced to rely on alternate forms of transportation to reach campus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>TRAPPED</strong></p>\n<p>While many students fled the fires by going back to their hometowns, most faculty and staff did not have that option.</p>\n<p>“I went stir crazy,” said Janet Mizrahi, a professor in the writing department, in an email. “I continued to meet my goal of 10,000 steps daily by listening to an audiobook while I walked in circles in my small house! My dog thought I was nuts!”</p>\n<p>For Nomi Morris, another professor in the writing department who lives in Upper Ojai, the fire originated near Ojai and blazed through her neighborhood, giving her only a half an hour to gather her belongings. While her own street was spared, many houses in her neighborhood were destroyed.</p>\n<p>She first evacuated her home and came to Goleta with her family, until the unhealthy air quality pushed them to move further north and stay with a family friend.</p>\n<p>Some professors living in voluntary evacuation zones also had to leave their homes just before finals week. Many made their exams optional or changed them to take-home finals.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>TRANSPORTATION DIFFICULTIES</strong></p>\n<p>The mudslides in January also made it difficult for many faculty and staff to get to campus.</p>\n<p>Writing professor Ilene Miele was forced to drive through Ventura during the Thomas Fire until she ultimately decided to cancel class for a day because of the fire’s proximity to Route 101. For the past week, she has been taking the ferry to Santa Barbara, initially relying on a colleague to drive her to campus before learning about a UCSB shuttle service at the Santa Barbara Harbor.</p>\n<p>“What caused the most anxiety for me, at first, was not knowing how I would get there and make it to the first day of class,” Miele said in an email. “The first day they warned us to expect a rocky ride, but it was a fairly gentle roll … Overall, I was fortunate that we had good weather and the rides were fairly quick (an hour and a half each way).”</p>\n<p>Morris stayed in Santa Barbara for the first week of the quarter due to closed roads and classes that end too late for her to take a train back.</p>\n<p>According to Mary Ferris, executive director of Student Health Service, staff at Student Health also faced exceptional difficulty ensuring coverage with blocked roads and the recent flu outbreaks. Understaffing, combined with increased demand stretched the staff thin, resulting in longer hours.</p>\n<p>She said that because of the staff’s commitment to health, they went to extreme lengths to reach campus, with some staff staying overnight in Santa Barbara for the week. One pharmacist even flew to Santa Barbara from Oxnard in the morning.</p>\n<p>“Every day was a new challenge,” Ferris said. “When you’re in healthcare you can’t just close.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>EMOTIONAL IMPACT</strong></p>\n<p>Beyond physical losses, the constant evacuations and impacted schedules have taken an emotional toll on staff and faculty.</p>\n<p>“I managed to stay calm from day to day, but never quite sure when and if I would freak out,” Paul Sonnino, a professor in the history department, said in an email. “Haven’t yet, but the sense of uncertainty is taking its toll.”</p>\n<p>Mizrahi lost a close personal friend who was swept away by the mudslide.</p>\n<p>“Losing a contemporary is a devastating kind of loss — after all, it so easily could have been me,” she said in an email. “It’s emotionally devastating.”</p>\n<p>For Miele, her experiences being blocked from campus and driving through the fire have left her uncertain.</p>\n<p>“These days when I get on the 101, I think of it as the highway of doubt. Depending on the conditions, you’re never quite sure whether you’ll get there or if you’ll get home,” she said. “Much as I know we need the rain in Southern California, I’ll be glad when winter is over this year.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>RETURNING TO CAMPUS</strong></p>\n<p>Some professors also faced backlash from students over the cancellation of classes and office hours.</p>\n<p>“Some insensitive students — just a couple — got very upset because I did not give them automatic ‘A’s as compensation for my having had to cancel some office hours since the fire was approaching my house,” Sonnino said in an email.</p>\n<p>Other professors greatly enjoyed returning to campus, with students expressing concern for their well-being.</p>\n<p>“It was a relief to see young people, you know, hear the regular questions, and I’m enjoying my students immensely,” Mizrahi said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UNIVERSITY RESPONSE</strong></p>\n<p>Under the difficult circumstances, many praised the university for offering financial assistance through a special fund for faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>Some, however, have raised concerns about the speed at which UCSB made decisions.</p>\n<p>“As a faculty member I had the flexibility to cancel classes when I thought it was unsafe, but I know that staff members did not necessarily have that same flexibility,” Miele said. “So, while I understand that there are many complexities involved, I have concerns about the university’s ability to respond more quickly.”</p>\n<p>Despite the financial assistance, the experience has been challenging for those who were blocked by the roads.</p>\n<p>“The university has been terrific, but it is draining, it is stressful [and] it is harder to work. We’re all doing our best,” Morris said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>LOOKING BACK</strong></p>\n<p>Overwhelmingly, faculty and staff echoed the same sentiment — things could have been worse.</p>\n<p>“I just continually have this feeling that I got off easy,” said Morris, grateful that she still has her home, despite the lingering smell of smoke. “I just really want to make this clear that compared to what the people in Montecito are going through, I went through nothing.”</p>\n<p>Sonnino echoed similar sentiments, saying that compared to tragedies around the world, losing utilities at his house or a nearby bridge shattering are insignificant.</p>\n<p>“It only made me aware of how much worse off are people in Aleppo, Israel, Palestine, Puerto Rico, Seoul and other places who live under imminent threat day in and day out,” he said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>MOVING FORWARD</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone copes with tragedy in different ways.</p>\n<p>Assistant professor Leah Stokes was pushed into action after a frustrated tweet about climate change garnered positive responses.</p>\n<p>Her op-ed in <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em>, titled “Climate Change in my Backyard,” addresses the impact of climate change on recent climate disruptions, and acts as a “call to action,” urging people to focus more on environmental policy.</p>\n<p>“You just need one degree of separation to meet someone affected by this,” Stokes said. “My op-ed is about changing people’s minds, about how we talk about these events.”</p>\n<p>She hopes that people will speak out and influence others to understand that blaming Montecito residents for not evacuating is simple. Instead, she said, people need to understand the greater causes behind the devastation.</p>\n<p>Others focused on philanthropy and helping their community. Morris personally raised over $3,000 for two people who she knew were in need.</p>\n<p>For Mizrahi, the loss of her friend has pushed her to embrace the present.</p>\n<p>“For me, it just made me focus on right now and living,” she said. “It’s like I got a fire built under my butt … I’m not waiting, I’m not waiting, I’m just doing it now — because who knows what tomorrow will bring?”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 25 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.
