Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Following a summer filled with determination and growth, the Santa Barbara Gauchos have returned to the gym with ambition and high hopes for the upcoming season. While UCSB came up short last year in the Big West Tournament, the squad is eager to build on the biggest program turnaround in college basketball last year.</p>\n<p>It’s no coincidence that the team’s turnaround came at the same time that Coach Joe Pasternack took over the head coaching duties. After previous coaching positions at storied programs such as the University of Arizona and UC Berkeley, Pasternack took his second head coaching job with UCSB in March of 2017.</p>\n<p>As he took the helm, there was an instant shift in the culture of UCSB basketball. Pasternack stretched his recruiting range by adding a plethora of veteran graduate students and transfer players, and Santa Barbara eyed epic success on the hardwood once again.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although four of the five starters from last year’s historic squad departed in the offseason, the Gauchos ushered in another wave of transfer students who are keen on making an immediate impact on the team. The lone incumbent starter, junior guard Max Heidegger, has assumed a prominent leadership role as a weathered Gaucho to welcome his incoming teammates.</p>\n<p>“We have seven or eight new guys,” Heidegger explained. “We’re [focused] on building camaraderie, getting everyone into our system and doing what Coach P. expects from us.”</p>\n<p>Of those players who made the move to sunny Santa Barbara, the majority of the transfer additions are guards and wings. Spearheaded by sophomore point guard Devearl Ramsey, who redshirted last year after a move from the University of Nevada, and graduate transfer Ar’mond Davis, who brings tournament experience after his March Madness run with the University of Alabama last season, the new faces plan to make a significant impact early in the year.</p>\n<p>“It makes practice competitive,” Heidegger joked. “Offense, get to the rim, do what we did last year; obviously we were the best offense in the Big West.” Heidegger harped on the team’s focus for the upcoming year: “Defense, defense, defense … When I talk about what Coach P. wants for the culture, it’s all about playing defense and playing hard; that’s what we’re getting everybody to do.”</p>\n<p>As the transfer guards get situated in their new roles and fight for a spot on the starting rotation, the Gauchos have also integrated a myriad of young talent into the program at the forward position.</p>\n<p>The freshmen forward duo of Jay Nagle and Amadou Sow tower over opponents at 6’8” and 6’9” respectively. As if the Twin Tower additions weren’t enough, the Gauchos continued to reinforce their front court this offseason when the team introduced sophomore forward Robinson Idehen, a native Spaniard who staggers at a whopping 6’10”.</p>\n<p>As the big men get situated in their new digs, who better to mentor the young forwards than fifth-year senior center Ami Lakoju? With a first-hand look at the paradigm shift between Coach Williams and Coach Pasternack, Lakoju is the ideal guide to transition the new recruits into the culture that UCSB basketball is currently rebuilding.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot of young talent,” Lakoju beamed. “If you make a mistake, just brush it off. You have to focus on executing your job. Everybody has their own role.”</p>\n<p>The veteran big man had a career year last season playing in all 32 matches for the Gauchos, including starting seven games, as he facilitated in the absence of Jalen Canty. As he battles back from an offseason toe injury, Lakoju suggested that his game continues to evolve under Coach Pasternack.</p>\n<p>“Mentally I’ve seen players grow under each coaching staff,” Lakoju observed. “I feel like the game is so mental. As a freshman, I didn’t really see it that way … if you’re strong mentally, physically you can do anything.”</p>\n<p>The complement of veteran leadership and young talent makes for a deadly combination. With Coach Joe Pasternack at the reigns, this Gaucho team reflects a shut-down defense along with an offensive attack that sends shivers down the spines of every Big West coach.</p>\n<p>While most teams would have a bleak outlook on this season following the departure of four starters, this Santa Barbara squad has unusually high potential in the upcoming year. With the recent talent brought in for the 2019 season, the Gauchos have high expectations for a successful Big West campaign and a deep run in postseason play.</p><div

After years of depressing dead-end rosters, the Kings finally have a team of exciting young talent. </span><span style=\"color: black;\">Second-year point guard De’Aaron Fox, possibly the quickest player in the NBA, got a jump shot in the offseason and looked like a real-life point guard in preseason. The Kings haven’t had one of those since they traded Isaiah Thomas for Alex Oriakhi, who currently plays in Mexico.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 12.25pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Marvin Bagley III was the No. 2 pick of the 2018 NBA draft and could be a franchise big man with his incredible bounce and touch around the rim. He can’t really use his right hand on offense and is so bad at defense that Duke had to revamp its entire system for him, but it was definitely still smart to pick Bagley over Luka Doncic, 19-year-old reigning Euroleague MVP.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 12.25pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">The sleeper young talent, however, is Harry Giles. The 20th pick of the 2017 NBA draft, Giles was the top-rated high school player in a recruiting class that included Jayson Tatum and Lonzo Ball, but multiple knee surgeries on both knees cut his sole season at Duke short and pushed him down in the draft.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 12.25pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">The Kings played it safe last season and kept Giles on the shelf all year, but news came out around the All-Star Break that he was dominating practices. We’ve seen him play in Summer League and preseason now, and he’s lived up to the hype.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 12.25pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">He’s still athletic with ball skills and a point guard’s passing vision, all of which are reasons he was billed as a new-age Chris Webber in high school. He’s got a jump shot, too, which means he’s a ball-handling seven-footer who can rebound, pass] and knock down threes. He’s also a pretty good defender, if you’re into that.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 12.25pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">A quick heads up: When you become a Kings fan, you also have to become a devout Harry Giles apostle. You’ll notice every Kings fan online is devoted to spreading the word of Giles. He’s that good, and we also haven’t had a reason to hope for so long.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 12.25pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Fox, Bagley and Giles make for a good young core, along with a supporting cast of players like Buddy Hield, Bogdan Bogdanovic and Frank Mason. The team won’t be good this year, but they’ll certainly be fun and interesting to watch.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 12.25pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Speaking of which, I should mention how bad they’re going to be this year. It’s important to me that you know what you’re signing up for as a Sacramento Kings fan. They’re going to be the worst or second worst team in the Western Conference and one of the five worst teams in the league. </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84398\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/the-ultimate-buy-low-the-sacramento-kings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84398\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/the-ultimate-buy-low-the-sacramento-kings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/the-ultimate-buy-low-the-sacramento-kings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/the-ultimate-buy-low-the-sacramento-kings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/the-ultimate-buy-low-the-sacramento-kings/","id":1000,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[999,998,997],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Athlete Spotlight: Sophomore Guard Devearl Ramsey","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-10-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Devearl-Ramsey-edit.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Devearl-Ramsey-edit.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Staff writer Max Kelton explores the long-awaited potential of 2-time gold medalist point guard Devearl Ramsey.

Coach Joe Pasternack, now on his second season with the team, has made a significant shift in the program’s recruiting tactics with a greater emphasis on bringing in transfer students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Pasternack took over after the 2016-17 season, only one player on the roster was a transfer recruit while the rest of the team was noticeably young. Pasternack rostered three transfers in his first year, all of whom played a significant role in the 16-win turnaround season following an abysmal 2016. Now in Pasternack’s second year, the Gauchos sport five transfer athletes on their roster, which is now composed of an abundance of experienced veteran players.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He really just wants the best from you; he’s really detailed oriented,” Ramsey said with a grin. “[Pasternack] has some of the qualities that the USA coaches had … I feel like he’s getting the best out of all of us and he’s doing a great job.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Devearl Ramsey is no stranger to successful basketball programs. Ramsey played high school ball at Sierra Canyon located in Los Angeles, Calif., ranking No. 5 in California and No. 21 nationwide in his final year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During his sophomore and junior seasons, the point guard was a gold medalist. Ramsey won the FIBA Under-17 World Cup while playing on the same team as Jayson Tatum, Marvin Bagley III and Josh Jackson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People like that, they always work hard. They make you want to get in the gym, too; you guys push each other,” Ramsey said. “It’s been great working out with Marvin, he works out with my brother … I’ve been in the gym with a lot of guys like that; it’s good to go at each other.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Battling back from an injury last season, Devearl zoned in on what aspects of his game could develop with his time off. His older brother Earl works as a trainer in Los Angeles, and together they made significant strides forward during his redshirt year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My brother is like my right hand … he’s the reason I went and started playing basketball. He’s been with me every step of the way,” Ramsey expressed about his recent training focus. “Once I started being able to play, I began working on my jump shot … I feel like I’ve really improved my jump shot.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heading into his first season as a Gaucho, the sophomore has high expectations for the offense under Coach Pasternack. His transition has been somewhat seamless, and now that the point guard is at 100 percent physically, UCSB will run its high-powered attack through Devearl Ramsey. Expect to hear Ramsey’s voice commanding the floor come game time — it’ll be the loudest noise on the court.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A version of this story appeared on page 6 in the Oct. 11 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</span></i></p>\n<p class=\"Body\" style=\"text-indent: 12.25pt;

Throughout this past week’s It’s On Us Week of Action campaign, students signed pledges and wore buttons to demonstrate their support. <br><em>Photo courtesy of UCSB CARE Twitter account @ucsbcare </em></p></div>\n<p>Campus Advocacy for Resources and Education (CARE) led a rally Friday as part of the national It’s On Us initiative, a campaign led by President Barack Obama’s administration to prevent sexual assault on college campuses.</p>\n<p>The rally marked the end of the It’s On Us Week of Action, which ended this past Friday, during which students signed pledges and wore buttons to demonstrate their support for the campaign. Student a-cappella group InterVals opened the rally with a performance, followed by speeches by CARE staff members Hannah Brown and Emily Potter on the social complexities of sexual violence and how the university can take action to prevent sexual abuse. They were joined by co-chair of Take Back the Night Gema Hernandez, Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming and California Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson staff member Liora Goodman.</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Hannah Brown, a CARE staff member and one of the main organizers of the event, said she wants the campaign to inform students about what CARE can do for those who have been sexually assaulted or for those who know someone who has been a victim of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“Our main message for survivors is that we want to create an environment that’s accepting and not shameful,” Brown said. “We want survivors to know that they aren’t alone and we are here to support them. As for people who aren’t survivors – if you see something we hope you will step in and protect your friends and people you see on the street.”</p>\n<p>According to third-year sociology major and event organizer Emily Potter, the university officially registered with the It’s On Us campaign last month and said while the CARE program has been addressing college sexual assault for years, the issue itself is getting more substantial attention nationally.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been trying to raise awareness of the issues surrounding sexual assault for years and I think it’s finally, nationally, getting the attention it deserves,” Potter said. “Nothing groundbreaking, but it’s picking up.”</p>\n<p>Potter said people have a difficult time believing victims of sexual assault, which leaves victims feeling insecure and unsupported.</p>\n<p>“I was raped when I was 15,” Potter said. “The first person I told said to me ‘Don’t even pull that shit on me when you admit that you had sex.’ That was when the seed of doubt was planted in me.”</p>\n<p>Brown said she believes the event was a success considering the large participation CARE saw throughout the week.</p>\n<p>“I think people are standing up and saying ‘Hey, this is something I really want to support,’” Brown said. “Especially because we’ve been doing our pledge drive this week and tons of people – hundreds of people – have come in and signed our pledge. It’s really great to see the support from all the students once they’ve seen what the issue is.”</p>\n<p>According to Potter, who opened her speech with the It’s On Us pledge, the campaign is important in light of the lack of support society gives survivors.</p>\n<p>“I pledge to create an environment in which sexual assault is unacceptable and survivors are supported,” Potter said. “Currently we do not have that environment. For some reason, we seem to find it easier to believe the perpetrator over the survivor.”</p>\n<p>Second-year film major Timmy Linetsky attended the It’s On Us rally and said he was proud of the speakers and campaign organizers for sharing their stories and advice.</p>\n<p>“I thought some of the stories people shared were really brave,” Linetsky said. “My best friend gave a speech today and I thought that was incredible.”</p>\n<p><em>[<strong>CORRECTION</strong>: A previous version of this article switched Emily Potter and Hannah Brown’s quotes, attributing Brown’s quotes to Potter’s and Potter’s quotes to Brown.
