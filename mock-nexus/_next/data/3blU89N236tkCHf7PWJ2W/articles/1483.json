With just four games remaining in the regular season, the Gauchos play UC Davis today and No. 20 Cal Poly on Saturday, leading both teams by just a point for first place in the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>Two straight losses on the road has set Santa Barbara back to a record of 9-5-1 overall and 4-2 in the conference. Meanwhile, Davis enters today’s game at Harder Stadium at 7-6-2 overall, 3-1-2 Big West.</p>\n<p>“Our season does in effect come down to this week,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Last week is done, but we can’t forget why we lost both games. I’m excited that our guys are going to show up tomorrow and play really hard against a team that’s been playing really well.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After starting conference play a perfect 4-0, the Gauchos crashed back down to Earth with a rough 5-2 loss at Sacramento St. last Wednesday. Playing at rival Cal Poly just three days later, UCSB was unable to hold on late, falling 3-2 in double overtime.</p>\n<p>“The Big West conference is not kind. You have to play well in every game,” Vom Steeg said. ”</p>\n<p>Fortunately for the Gauchos, they will get a shot to play both teams again, this time on their home field. UCSB has once again had its fair share of success playing under the lights of Harder Stadium, owning a 5-1 mark at home this season.</p>\n<p>Getting back on the winning track may just have to do with the play of junior forward Nick DePuy. With seven game-winners this year, DePuy has more than any player in the nation. His 12 scores overall is tied for second.</p>\n<p>The 6-4 Irvine native had scored in five consecutive games prior to last week’s two-game road trip, and it seems to be no coincidence that when his streak ended, so did his team’s. In games where DePuy has scored over the last two seasons, UCSB has gone an undefeated 15-0-3.</p>\n<p>Giving support on the Gauchos’ offensive front is a wide combination of attacking options that includes three dangerous lefties.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani ranks second in the Big West in shots with 43, behind only DePuy. The pressure he has applied to back lines this year tells much more than his three goal, two assist stat line will.</p>\n<p>A leading candidate for Big West Freshman of the Year in Geoffrey Acheampong has been the Gauchos’ best creator all season. To go along with his three goals, the forward’s seven assists ranks first in the conference and seventh in the nation. He has recorded a point in eight of UCSB’s last ten games, accumulating a record of 7-2-1 when he has scored or assisted this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ last two outings also saw the return of junior left back Ismaila Jome from an ankle sprain that kept him out for nearly eight full games. Proving that he’s back and ready to make an impact heading into the postseason, Jome put away a goal in each of last week’s losses – his first two scores of the season.</p>\n<p>With most of the starting lineup ready to go at this point, the pressure falls on UCSB’s defense to get the job done as it tries to secure a No. 1 seed. The Gauchos have conceded 11 goals in their six conference games this season, just one less than last-ranked Sac St. and UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>“To be 14, 15 games into the season and dominating games, but then giving up excellent scoring opportunities, it’s a recipe for disaster,” Vom Steeg said. “The way we’re going to bounce back is with a renewed commitment to defending. Not just our defenders, but some of our forwards coming down. We need to go back from giving up eight goals last week to giving up none, or one.”</p>\n<p>For the Aggies, defense has not been as much of an issue, giving up just six through six Big West games. They own the conference’s longest active unbeaten streak at four games, all of which went into overtime.</p>\n<p>Senior defender/midfielder Lucas Mohageg has scored seven goals this season to lead the offense, tied for second in the conference. More recently, redshirt freshman defender Roy Boateng has given solid production, recording a brace in a 3-2 win over Cal Poly last Wednesday and picking up the assist on Davis’s lone goal against Sac St. on Saturday.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s focus tonight will be solely on getting a win, but win or lose, that focus will quickly shift to Saturday’s game with Cal Poly. The Mustangs are also in action tonight, playing Sac St. at home as they look to surpass both UCSB and Davis in the standings.</p>\n<p>“Every year it comes down to something like this,” Vom Steeg said. “When you’re the team that gets the bullseye like we do, we have to rise to that challenge every time we play. The players know what’s at stake and I believe they are committed to give us the effort that we need.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and Aggies are set for kickoff tonight at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65639\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/defining-week-for-no-19-ucsb-begins-tonight-against-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65639\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/defining-week-for-no-19-ucsb-begins-tonight-against-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/defining-week-for-no-19-ucsb-begins-tonight-against-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/defining-week-for-no-19-ucsb-begins-tonight-against-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/defining-week-for-no-19-ucsb-begins-tonight-against-uc-davis/","id":1483,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1482,1481,1480],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson","biography":"Not available","articles":[121,137,246,247,249,250,342,355,358,359,360,377,378,380,384,386,390,394,397,399,400,404,405,413,415,417,418,421,428,432,435,436,438,443,445,459,460,462,463,464,466,469,475,477,480,482,483,486,495,497,498,499,500,501,505,545,599,843,967,968,971,982,984,985,986,987,988,989,990,991,992,993,994,995,1016,1017,1019,1020,1021,1023,1024,1025,1107,1147,1173,1198,1400,1462,1463,1464,1469,1470,1471,1472,1474,1476,1477,1478,1481,1482,1483,1485,1486,1487,1495,1498,1501,1502,1504,1507,1508,1509,1510,1511,1514,1516,1517,1519,1521,1523,1525,1533,1534,1535,1536,1537,1538,1543,1544,1545,1546,1547,1548,1551,1552,1553,1556,1557,1559,1985,1994,1999,2028,2033,2039,2066,3210,3219,3230,3241,3258,3285,3289,3291,3295,5051,5065,5067,5078,5083,5084,5086,5087,5090,5091,5092,5093,5094,5095,5096,5099,5100,5243,5262,5276,5277,5278,5279,5280,5281,5282,5283,5284,5285,5286,5288,5293,5305,5306,5308,5309,5312,5313],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Shifts Focus to Annual Blue-Green Clash","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo1-web.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos’ last victory over the Mustangs came in a 2-1 home win back in 2011.

The Mustangs enter Harder Stadium with a record of 5-5-5 overall and 1-3 in the Big West.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Despite its loss, this past weekend was a learning experience for the young Santa Barbara team.</p>\n<p>UCSB started four freshmen against Long Beach including midfielder Sydney Magnin and forward Mallory Hromatko. Although they did not score a goal, the two helped get touches to sophomore forward Amanda Ball and senior forward Savannah Francis, who both returned from injuries in Saturday’s match.</p>\n<p>“It’s great getting these experienced players back on the field,” junior defender Sydney Fuertes said. “This allows our subs to maintain the same level of play the game started at and mix [it] up depending on the personnel.”</p>\n<p>Francis and Ball have been sidelined for the majority of the season, Ball being out since UCSB’s 1-1 tie versus San Jose State on Aug. 28. The two have made an impact in their two games back combining for seven shots and one goal.</p>\n<p>The majority of the Gauchos’ offensive production has been a result of their younger players’ contributions as the freshmen have scored 13 out of UCSB’s 20 goals, a team well on its way to surpassing its mark of 32 goals in 2014. Of the 13 goals, Hromatko has really taken the lead in the attacking third.</p>\n<p>“[These freshman] have not been intimidated by this new environment of college soccer,” Stumpf said. “Their ability to make adjustments on the fly and incorporate it in their games highlights their high [soccer] IQ. What we’re asking them to do in short order has been a pleasant surprise for us.”</p>\n<p>Hromatko has started all 13 games at forward for the Gauchos tallying in a team-high six goals and four assists. Her six goals are tied for fourth place in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Of the nine games that Hromatko has either scored or assisted UCSB has won seven contests. The freshman forward ranks among the top 10 in conference points, shots on goal percentage and game winners. Hromatko’s excellent performance has not gone unnoticed, earning a nomination for Big West Player of the Week three times this season.</p>\n<p>“We’ve relied on a younger squad this year but they’ve really stepped up to the occasion,” said Fuertes. “It’s awesome seeing so many freshmen seizing this opportunity to help out the team.”</p>\n<p>On the defensive end junior defender Sydney Fuertes has recently been the focal point for Santa Barbara’s backline. While individual stats don’t show it, Fuertes has helped the Gauchos’ defensive unit to a low .83 goals against average, good for third place in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“[Sydney] has all those great qualities of leadership by example, said Stumpf. “She’s not the best athlete but she’s smart and can anticipate things so well.”</p>\n<p>The San Clemente native also played a major role last season starting 19 matches as a sophomore for UCSB. Feurtes’ defensive contributions propelled her team to five shutouts this year.</p>\n<p>While Cal Poly is on a two-game losing streak, the Mustangs will be looking for another win against their rival. Hosting the Gauchos on Oct. 26 last season, the Mustangs used their home field to their advantage, scoring two early goals in the third and 14th minutes and securing a 2-0 victory.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Caitlyn Kreutz and junior forward Megan Abutin will carry the load for the Mustang offense.</p>\n<p>Kreutz has quickly filled her role at the forward position for Cal Poly placing third in the Big West with seven goals. The freshman from Clovis has recorded a pair of goals in three matches this season, the last one coming off the Mustangs’ 7-2 victory over Hawaii on Oct. 4. Kreutz has been very disciplined in taking good looks at goal earning fourth place in the Big West with a shot percentage of .333.</p>\n<p>Megan Aubutin is the main facilitator of the Mustangs, setting up teammates and tallying in five assists on the year. It will be the offensive production of Kreutz and savvy decision making of Abutin that UCSB must be aware of.</p>\n<p>One final piece to the Mustang’s offense is senior forward Elise Krieghoff. Krieghoff has five goals on the year and 51 career goals during her four years at Cal Poly. Also a Clovis native, Krieghoff earned her ninth career Big West Player of the Week award after scoring one goal apiece in the Mustangs’ 1-1 tie against then No. 6 BYU and preseason top-25 team Pepperdine.</p>\n<p>On the defensive end the Gauchos face arguably the best goal keeper in the Big West, senior Alyssa Giannetti. Emerging as the defensive leader for her team, Giannetti is one of the premiere defensive players in conference ranking in the top five in saves and save percentage.</p>\n<p>“The challenge we face is it can’t just be something good to go in. It has to be special,” said Stumpf. “That’s what it’s going to take to beat someone like [Giannetti].”</p>\n<p>Starting all four years for the Mustangs, the keeper from Yorba Linda has racked up 80 saves this season, 25 more than any keeper in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB will take on Cal Poly at Harder Stadium this Thursday. The match will kick off at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of October 15, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65417\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ucsb-shifts-focus-to-annual-blue-green-clash/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65417\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ucsb-shifts-focus-to-annual-blue-green-clash/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ucsb-shifts-focus-to-annual-blue-green-clash/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ucsb-shifts-focus-to-annual-blue-green-clash/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ucsb-shifts-focus-to-annual-blue-green-clash/","id":1480,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1479,1478,1477],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nick DePuy: UCSB’s Humble Beast","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/FEAT-MensSoccer_UCR_Oct-08_BRANDT_9533-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/FEAT-MensSoccer_UCR_Oct-08_BRANDT_9533-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Over the past 13 months, Nick DePuy has meant everything to the Gauchos.

The UCSB men’s soccer team is coming off an excellent bounce-back year in which it went undefeated in conference play on the way to a second round appearance in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg knows that things are going to be different this time around, as he has to replace nearly half of his team’s goal scoring production which previously came from graduated senior forwards Goffin Boyoko and Achille Campion.</p>\n<p>Nearing the midpoint of the season, things haven’t been going so well. The Gauchos have struggled to score goals and have managed a record of 2-3-1 through six games – not nearly up to UCSB’s high standards.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Having tried nearly everything he could think of in search of goals, Vom Steeg is forced to make a big decision in the final weekend before conference play begins.</p>\n<p>Thus begins the story of Nick DePuy.</p>\n<p>“We were at the point in our season where we were below .500. We had tried every forward combination we had and we couldn’t get results from them,” Vom Steeg said. “Nick was our next best option as a big target player with good size. It was a little bit out of desperation in terms of putting him up front, but we had seen a lot of things in practice that told us he might do well.”</p>\n<p>Playing San Diego State on September 26 of last year, DePuy, a sophomore who had seen limited playing time being moved around the midfield and center back positions, got his first ever start at forward. Prior to that game, the 6-4 Irvine native had just one career goal, scored three weeks prior in a 1-1 tie against Northwestern.</p>\n<p>Little did anyone know, this season was about to get turned around in a big way.</p>\n<p>“I knew especially after my freshman year when we had a lot of seniors graduate that we were kind of low on the offensive side,” DePuy said. “I just wanted to work as hard as I could and help the team, whether that’s on defense or going up top and scoring a goal.”</p>\n<p>And help his team he did, as he capitalized on his first start as the team’s leading offensive option by tapping home a goal in the 21st minute. The 1-0 result got UCSB back on track as it headed into Big West play, sparking a season-best run of four straight wins.</p>\n<p>Not only did DePuy notch the first of his nation-best 13 game-winners over the past 13 months, but he began cementing his spot as the focal point in the Gauchos’ offense.</p>\n<p>“He got us the goal, he won the game, and that’s going to lead to the next start, which leads to another goal and another start,” Vom Steeg said. “If you’re looking for goals and you’re getting goals, you’re not going to mess with that. After five or six games, we saw that up front could be the place for him.”</p>\n<p>Having been voted the overwhelming favorites to finish first in the North Division in the 2014 Big West Preseason Coaches Poll, the Gauchos entered conference play last year at 4-3-1 and well short of living up to their own standards.</p>\n<p>Facing Cal State Northridge in its Big West opener, UCSB was able to overcome a 1-0 deficit thanks to a 71st minute winner by DePuy, who headed in a far post cross from teammate Drew Murphy back across the six-yard box.</p>\n<p>Neither the weekend nor DePuy were done at that point. Just two days later, UC Irvine came to town boasting a No. 3 national ranking as it looked to steal one on the road.</p>\n<p>In one of the most memorable moments in UCSB’s recent history, DePuy stunned the Anteaters with an unbelievable strike from 30 yards out, giving the Gauchos a 1-0 lead with just 37 seconds left on the clock.</p>\n<p>“I had a good chance early in that game and I knew I had to get that one back. I got the ball, I just wanted to hit it on frame and it went right where I wanted it to go,” DePuy said. “That was probably my most memorable goal here, especially since it was at home in front of a couple 1,000 people and against Irvine.”</p>\n<p>With his second game-winner in three nights, and despite never having played forward for an extended period of time, the now former midfielder was suddenly thrust into the national spotlight, earning both a Big West Offensive Player of the Week and a National Player of the Week award.</p>\n<p>“Things definitely started moving pretty fast after that. It was an honor,” DePuy said. “I’m glad I could get that achievement, but in the back of my head, obviously I was just thinking, ‘Help this team win,’ and I’m glad I could do that.”</p>\n<p>Never one to boast about his individual achievements, the team-first attitude that DePuy has made evident every time he steps on the field is a key reason for why he has been so dominant over the past two seasons. It certainly hasn’t hurt in building a high level of trust with his head coach, as he continues to prove that he can get the job done each and every time he steps on the field.</p>\n<p>“It’s a team sport. I wouldn’t be able to score those goals if someone didn’t cross it, and we wouldn’t win without our defense,” DePuy said. “I think [Vom Steeg] understands the trust aspect, that I’m going to work hard for my teammates and I’m a good forward that’s going to hold up the play. That helps a lot in the sense that we’ve known each other for two years already and we still have another year and a half to go.”</p>\n<p>Starting at forward the rest of the season, DePuy went on to score six game-winners and 10 goals overall – good for second in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Ever since making his first start at forward 30 games ago, DePuy has many times been the only difference between UCSB winning or losing. In games that he has scored, the Gauchos have a near-perfect, undefeated mark of 15-0-3.</p>\n<p>“Our success this year, it’s no surprise, will start and end with how Nick does in terms of him scoring goals,” Vom Steeg said. “When he scores goals, we win.”</p>\n<p>Proving that his breakout season was no fluke, the junior started his 2015 campaign the best way possible, scoring another decisive header against No. 9 Stanford in a 1-0 season-opening victory.</p>\n<p>Things seemed to start following the same script every game, as in the Gauchos’ first four Big West games this year, DePuy scored five goals – four of them game-winners.</p>\n<p>His list of streaks and achievements now reads like a perennial All-Star’s. At one point this season, DePuy earned his second career National Player of the Week award and three consecutive Big West Player of the Weeks, making him the first player ever to accomplish that feat. His total of five conference awards has him tied for third all-time in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Prior to last Wednesday’s game at Sacramento St., DePuy had scored an incredible 21 goals in 26 games, more than any player in the nation over that stretch. He currently sits atop the country with seven game-winners in 2015 and is tied for second with 12 scores.</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen situations this year where Nick has really started to take over games and be completely dominant,” Vom Steeg said. “Now, we just need him to keep going in that direction.”</p>\n<p>It’s remarkable what DePuy has been able to accomplish, especially considering the fact that he had never been a permanent forward in his life prior to last season. As is the case with many breakout situations, it has been a combination of raw talent and excellent coaching that has led to all this success.</p>\n<p>“We recruited Nick on 100 percent potential. Here was this really big, athletic midfielder who was mobile, had good feet, and a good first touch,” Vom Steeg said. “Once we’ve decided that he’s a forward, there is a set of skills that you need to work on in order to be a good forward. My job as a coach is to keep pushing him and keep encouraging him that the sky’s the limit.”</p>\n<p>Another huge contributing factor has been the play of DePuy’s supporting cast, particularly during this season. A couple of left-footed forwards in sophomore Ahinga Selemani and freshman Geoffrey Acheampong have joined DePuy atop the Big West stat charts, with the former ranking third in shots and the latter tied for the conference lead in assists with seven.</p>\n<p>“We’ve created a pretty good environment for [the players],” Vom Steeg said. “Nick doesn’t get those chances if he doesn’t have good players around him. He’s got Ahinga working hard for him, he’s got service coming, and now he just needs to keep doing his part.”</p>\n<p>Up next for DePuy and UCSB is a huge game against Cal Poly this Saturday. Sitting in first place in the standings, the Gauchos will be relying on their superstar to bring them the postseason glory they have worked all year for.</p>\n<p>Win or lose, though, DePuy will continue to be fueled by his competitive fire and the desire to play the game he loves.</p>\n<p>“I’m loving my time at UCSB right now,” he said. “I’m loving the soccer, too. I enjoy it every time I play.”</p>\n<p>Whatever happens down the stretch of this season, one thing is for sure: we’re all just lucky that he’s only a junior.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65665\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/nick-depuy-ucsbs-humble-beast/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65665\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/nick-depuy-ucsbs-humble-beast/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/nick-depuy-ucsbs-humble-beast/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/nick-depuy-ucsbs-humble-beast/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/nick-depuy-ucsbs-humble-beast/","id":1481,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1480,1479,1478],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 18 UCSB Seeks Revenge in Home Finale Against Sac St.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mens_Soccer_SLO_10.24_Eric_Swenson_026-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mens_Soccer_SLO_10.24_Eric_Swenson_026-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Still just a point in front of No. 22 Cal Poly for first place, the Gauchos need a win against a team that beat them 5-2 earlier this month.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_65790\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mens_Soccer_SLO_10.24_Eric_Swenson_026-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"778732682\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65870\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65790\" data-attachment-id=\"65790\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/no-18-ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-home-finale-against-sac-st/ismaila-jome-passes-the-ball-in-towards-the-box-eric-swensondaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mens_Soccer_SLO_10.24_Eric_Swenson_026-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"Ismaila Jome passes the ball in towards the box.

The Gauchos suffered an embarrassing 5-2 loss to the Hornets the last time the two teams played earlier this month.</p>\n<p>“At some point, hopefully sooner rather than later, we’ll figure out how to be good and finish off a game,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Today we’ve got payback, so our guys should be excited about that.”</p>\n<p>With just two games remaining, Santa Barbara possesses the Big West’s best record at 10-5-2 overall and 5-2-1 in conference. The Hornets, who qualified for the Big West Tournament for the first time in 2014, are currently in last place in the North at 6-8-2 overall, 3-4-1 conference. They trail UC Davis by just one point for the final playoff spot.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos are coming off perhaps the most disappointing undefeated week in program history. After a sluggish, frustrating 2-1 win over UC Davis last Wednesday, UCSB let a 2-0 lead slip away against Cal Poly on Saturday, conceding a game-tying goal with just four seconds left to go. The game ended in a 2-2 tie after two overtimes.</p>\n<p>A win would have given the Gauchos complete control in the standings, but they are still just a point ahead of the Mustangs for the No. 1 seed and home-field advantage in the postseason.</p>\n<p>“The result’s disappointing,” Vom Steeg said. “It doesn’t change what we have to do. Everything’s still out in front of us, but it’s still disappointing because it’s four seconds left to win a game.”</p>\n<p>When UCSB traveled to Sac St. two weeks ago riding a five-game win streak, the Hornets shocked the nation, pulling off a dominant upset. After Santa Barbara trailed 2-0 heading into the half, a red card to defender Sam Strong in the 61<sup>st</sup> minute made matters much worse, and Sac St. punished its helpless opponent to the tune of five goals, the most the team has scored against a Division I opponent since 2010.</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman Brad Bumgarner was a key player in the 5-2 win, picking up both an assist and a goal within the first 34 minutes. He leads Sac St. with six goals, 13 points and three game-winners.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, the 2-2 tie against Cal Poly marked the end of a three-game scoring drought for junior Nick DePuy. The 6-4 forward leads the Big West with 13 goals – six more than any other player – and seven game-winners.</p>\n<p>DePuy has benefited from having a number of attacking options in support this year. Freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong hooked up with sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani on Saturday for his eighth assist of the season, also a conference-best. Selemani put away his fourth goal, the second most on the team, ending a seven-game scoring drought.</p>\n<p>Defensively, neither team has been particularly stellar since the beginning of the conference season. UCSB ranks sixth in the Big West with a 1.63 goals against average while Sac St. comes in just behind at seventh, giving up 1.70 goals per game in conference play.</p>\n<p>While the Hornets defense is not going to have an easy time going up against the Big West’s top offense playing on its home turf, they will have their best chance of keeping the score low with goalkeeper James Del Curto playing in goal. The sophomore ranks 22<sup>nd</sup> in the nation with 4.75 saves per game, while he comes in at No. 2 in the Big West with a .760 save percentage.</p>\n<p>Scoring opportunities might be in abundance for the Gauchos tonight, but they’ll have to put away their chances if they are going to be able to pick up a win in their final home game of the season.</p>\n<p>Seniors Duncan Backus, Adam Carn-Saferstein, Brandon Brockway and Christian Rodriguez will be honored tonight as part of Senior Night.</p>\n<p>UCSB and Sac St. will kickoff at 7 p.m. tonight at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65870\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/no-18-ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-home-finale-against-sac-st/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65870\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/no-18-ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-home-finale-against-sac-st/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/no-18-ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-home-finale-against-sac-st/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/no-18-ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-home-finale-against-sac-st/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/no-18-ucsb-seeks-revenge-in-home-finale-against-sac-st/","id":1482,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1481,1480,1479],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
