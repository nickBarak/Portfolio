The contest will be held 3-7 p.m Wednesday at Corwin Pavilion and is open to the public.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The annual event is hosted by UCSB’s Technology Management Program (TMP), with the goal of encouraging startups. In the past, winners have been awarded cash prizes ranging from $7,500 to $15,000. This year, the six teams will be competing for a pot of $40,000 in prize money. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The teams this year are Collatera, CRYPTIX, Delta Leaf Labs, OrganicMatters, Phanta Field and Wanderlease, each coming off a hard-fought semifinal round held on May 3. Twenty teams participated in the fair, and the best six were chosen to move on to this final round.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The finalists were decided by the public who attended the fair, but the winner on Wednesday will be determined by a panel of judges. Here are the six teams competing for the final prize:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collatera, which proposes a better method for diabetes detection and prevention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CRYPTIX, which is creating a ticket search engine to eliminate inflated ticket prices and fraud. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delta Leaf Labs, which aims to mass-produce non-addictive marijuana for medical purposes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OrganicMatters, which looks to partner with the poultry industry and turn their waste products into fertilizer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phanta Field, which is trying to create augmented reality glasses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wanderlease, which is making an app that aspires to make subleasing easier. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, OSMO won the competition. The four-person team designed a portable water sampling instrument to make it easier for scientists to collect water samples.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They received the first-place prize of $12,000, but all the teams that made it to the finals walked away from the event with cash prizes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surprisingly, the second-place team walked away with the most amount of money, having additionally been awarded the People’s Choice Award and the Citrix Impact Award. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dave Adornetto, entrepreneurship director for TMP, said there were no major changes this year in terms of format, but there were more people who signed up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s participants have been preparing since the competition started back in November with 38 teams. Throughout Winter Quarter and part of Spring Quarter, the teams have been taking the first few steps on their business models and have been receiving entrepreneurship education in TMP seminars.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All this preparation will reach its final culmination on Wednesday.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Director of Legislative Accountability Steven Kwok facilitated the discussion, which focused heavily on improving candidate safety as competition during elections runs strong. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">External Vice President for Local Affairs candidate Justice Dumlao was injured in a bike accident while trying to find the best place for his campaign board the Sunday before active campaign began. As a tradition, candidates gather at Pardall Tunnel on Sunday then race across campus to distribute campaign material.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kian Maalizadeh, third-year biology major and transfer senator-elect, proposed a “lottery system” for assigning spots, which he said will eliminate the need for a race and increase the physical safety of students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student suggested that the boards move from the bike path to the front of the library to avoid the battle of best placement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another issue discussed at the meeting was the structure and timeline of the election cycle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After discussion, the ASEB decided active campaigning would move to Week Two of Spring Quarter in order to allow candidates and other students involved in the election process to concentrate on their midterms. This means that elections season would end during Week Three of Spring Quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candidates also faced problems surrounding the rules of the declaration of candidacy. Media outlets such as the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bottom Line</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported on the students’ candidacy soon after the declaration deadline at the end of Winter Quarter, but the candidates were not allowed to officially comment on their intent to run until Week Four of Spring Quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s like after declaration of candidacy you can’t acknowledge your own candidacy, which doesn’t make a lot of sense,” said Kristin Hsu, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">third-year political science major and external vice president for statewide affairs-elect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several students expressed concern over the environmental implications of the campaigning boards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amy Koo, a second-year political science major, said reducing the number of boards for each party could reduce waste and encourage candidates to use other methods of campaigning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we are moving towards a waste-free UCSB, then that’s something that can be restricted,” Koo said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meeting attendees agreed that the ASEB must be more involved in the campaigning process to reduce party harassment and hostility. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hate the fact that we are all friends, and yet for two weeks we hate each other,” Koo said. “[It’s] just not a good system, and it just breeds a lot of hostility, and it makes us less likely to work with each other in the future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kwok said the tense political climate results from the “atmosphere” created between parties.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It doesn’t have to be as hostile as it is,” Kwok said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77988\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-21/elections-board-students-discuss-election-safety-sustainability-more/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77988\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-21/elections-board-students-discuss-election-safety-sustainability-more/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-21/elections-board-students-discuss-election-safety-sustainability-more/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-21/elections-board-students-discuss-election-safety-sustainability-more/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-21/elections-board-students-discuss-election-safety-sustainability-more/","id":2374,"author":{"id":81,"name":"Victoria Gurrola"},"related":[2373,2372,2371],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
