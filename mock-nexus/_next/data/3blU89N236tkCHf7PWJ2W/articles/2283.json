Senate. She also served as a student representative in the Internal Affairs Committee the year before.</p>\n<p>Early on in her term, Sandhu said she had to adjust her approach to the position after realizing the weight of her role as a resource to the 25 senators in A.S. as well as her own office staff. This involved connecting senators with the resources they needed and giving them guidance as they worked to pass legislation and accomplish their personal projects and goals.</p>\n<p>“I’d say my primary focus was really empowering the senators, and I feel like I did a pretty good job of doing that,” Sandhu said.</p>\n<p>When training senators, Sandhu said she focused more on logistics such as legislative procedure and how meetings ran.</p>\n<p>During the A.S. Senate retreat, she said she tailored senate trainings to include what was taught in previous years as well as tenets she believed were important to note as well.</p>\n<p>Sandhu said some senators mentioned they could have used more direction, but she said it was mostly from those who did not attend the retreat.</p>\n<p>“I think that I did a fairly good job,” Sandhu said. “I think they moved into the groove of being in senate faster than I’ve seen happen in the past.”</p>\n<p>IVP is required to plan and attend trainings during their term, such as the Safe Zone/Queer 101 training which must be completed by the sixth week of Fall Quarter, according to the A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p>Sandhu said in years past, such trainings weren’t usually completed by week six due to students still settling into their positions. Sandhu was home very frequently this year and at times needed to postpone the trainings due to personal issues.</p>\n<p>“My mom got diagnosed with an illness so I had to be back pretty often,” Sandhu said. “Weekends that worked for me didn’t necessarily work for senators, so it was a lot of back and forth, and we just did not get to do that.”</p>\n<p>One of Sandhu’s goals at the beginning of her term was to increase accountability, specifically by publishing quarterly reports of how student fees were being spent. Sandhu’s intent with the quarterly reports, after speaking with her student fee advisory commissioner, was to create a “color-coded, user-friendly” website similar to that of UC Davis’s.</p>\n<p>However, the plan was halted after she received opposition from the Finance and Business Committee.</p>\n<p>Sandhu also expressed pride in the accountability of the senators this year, especially in their work with BCUs, saying that there have been a “lot of positive reviews” unlike in previous years.</p>\n<p>She credited her director of the legislative accountability, Greg Katz, as playing an important role in her ability to stay updated with the senators.</p>\n<p>“He was just a really good director of legislative accountability,” Sandhu said. “He went to their office hours weekly and made sure they were there and talked to them about what they needed and what projects they were working on and how he could help or I could help in any way, and then he would report back to me each week and let me know what they needed from me.”</p>\n<p>According to Sandhu, showing respect was an important part of making sure senators were completing their responsibilities and felt comfortable coming to her and Katz for help.</p>\n<p>“We weren’t here to just say you’re not doing your job but rather to make sure they had all the tools necessary to do their job,” Sandhu said.</p>\n<p>Regarding any projects she had planned but did not accomplish, Sandhu said she could have worked more on bridging the gap between the student body and A.S.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately most of my attention went to internal processes this year rather than bridging that gap, so I think I wish I could’ve done that more,” Sandhu said.</p>\n<p>One of Sandhu’s proudest moments this term was watching senators speak to each other after tense meetings. After one particular meeting wrought with high emotions and heavy subjects, Sandhu noted all the senators were “very sweet” to each other.</p>\n<p>“[Senate] has been very toxic in the past, so one thing I wanted to do this year was make sure that they knew they were all working toward the same goal of bettering the campus,” Sandhu said. “I don’t know if it was entirely me that went into play, but I think I did a fairly good job of maintaining that atmosphere, and they all took the initiative to continue to maintain that atmosphere.”</p>\n<p>Steven Ho, a second-year biology and Asian-American studies double major currently serving as an on-campus senator, will succeed Sandhu as IVP for the 2018-19 academic year.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the May 17, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Expectations were unreasonably high. Fans were even starting to say things like, “Hey, come on. Alex Smith isn’t THAT bad.

With Frank Gore, who has posted four consecutive 1,000-yard seasons as your running back, and Alex freaking Smith as your quarterback, those numbers should be reversed.</p>\n<p>In a quarterback-driven league, Smith, who has three touchdowns and seven interceptions, just doesn’t cut it. Because the Niners have a few offensive weapons like tight end Vernon Davis and wide receiver Michael Crabtree, they believe they can be a versatile offensive team. But nobody can perform if Smith doesn’t step it up. Davis has slowed down considerably after his breakout campaign last year, and Crabtree, who was vastly overvalued heading into this year’s fantasy drafts, has as many touchdowns as Chancellor Yang this season.</p>\n<p>The Singletary train seems to be slowing down considerably. Sure, Singletary was an amazing player and is a master motivator, but his talents as a coach are yet to be seen. Penalties have hindered San Francisco repeatedly this year, and a more structured, schematic coach may fit the squad better. To come back in the division and make a playoff push, Singletary is going to need to motivate and coach.</p>\n<p>It could be that the 49ers are just losing on purpose to get a shot at drafting Stanford’s Andrew Luck. Surely they wouldn’t fuck up again by passing on the local hero, as they did in 2005 when they drafted Smith #1 overall over Cal’s Aaron Rodgers. Ouch. I feel bad for Niner fans just writing that.</p>\n<p>There are few positives for the NFL franchise with the second most Super Bowl victories of all time. We all know linebacker Patrick Willis is an absolute beast. All over the field on every play, Willis looks like he is becoming the next Ray Lewis. Additionally, safety Taylor Mays has been making the most out of his playing time, and is looking like he can be the game-changing athlete he was at USC. That duo could be staples of a solid defense for years to come.</p>\n<p>The best thing going for SF is their weak division. The NFC West is BY FAR the worst division in football. With the non-convincing Arizona, St. Louis and Seattle squads all at 2-2, San Francisco could still easily come back and win the division.</p>\n<p>So to all you 49ers fans in I.V. out there: HAHA. Just kidding. At least the only way to go from here is up…</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

id=\"caption-attachment-83140\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>When Batsheva Labowe-Stoll was elected external vice president for local affairs, her platform included issues regarding student rights, landlord issues, creating a community court and instituting a new parking system.</p>\n<p>While some of these plans fell through, Labowe-Stoll was able to implement other projects and focus her time on being a liason for UC Santa Barbara in Isla Vista and within the Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll said she had to put many projects on hold due to “day-to-day” issues in I.V. that frequently arose and required a majority of her attention.</p>\n<p>“I had planned out a very different year than what had happened, and it’s because I represent students to a living, breathing local community and it’s hard to plan when it comes to that, especially in a community so vibrant and alive as Isla Vista,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll said she was most proud of the Pause campaign and the Pause. town hall that occured at the beginning of winter quarter.</p>\n<p>The campaign focused on encouraging students to abstain from drug abuse during stressful times and to instead “pause” and try to understand their own mental health as well as their peers, according to Labowe-Stoll.</p>\n<p>She is hoping to implement the ideas brought up at the town hall and has already begun that process by working with UCSB Student Affairs and the Vice Chancellor’s office.</p>\n<p>“I spent a lot of time working on student well-being and mental health just because of the fires and mudslides,” Labowe-Stoll said. “That took up a lot of my year, in terms of trying to inform the faculty and staff at UCSB about why it was so difficult for us to go through winter quarter and deal with all of this on top of just the stresses of being a normal student.”</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll also created Adulting 101, a series of classes offered through the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) office which are meant to supplement the academic curriculum students are enrolled in.</p>\n<p>The classes are meant to teach students important life skills about what it means to be an adult in the “real world.”</p>\n<p>The first class was held in February and focused on ways to reduce energy bills in order to save money and help with financial situations.</p>\n<p>The next class will take place in June and will inform dog owners about vaccinations, training and dog-care basics, according to Labowe-Stoll.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll hopes that the Adulting 101 program will continue into next year.</p>\n<p>She explained that all of her projects have been funded through funds allocated to her office. A large portion of those funds went toward a project that plans to distribute guides to the community that contain information about various resources in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“We are distributing guides that have all the resources in Isla Vista, everything from the Pardall office hours to dispatch numbers for the Isla Vista foot patrol, to all 5,000 doors in Isla Vista,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p>The guides have been made and are in the process of being paid for, according to Labowe-Stoll. She said the Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) and the Finance and Business Committee are also funding the project.</p>\n<p>The guides will be distributed at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2018.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll said the project was meant to be executed during Fall Quarter 2017, but was postponed due to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-24/thomas-fire-becomes-largest-wildfire-in-modern-california-history/\">Thomas Fire</a>. The project was again postponed during the Montecito mudslides in Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p>The project was postponed an additional time at the beginning of this quarter as a result of the  the A.S. election season and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/future-of-i-v-government-in-voters-hands/\">Measure R</a> efforts, according to Labowe-Stoll.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll said she represented students by attending meetings held by organizations such as Isla Vista Safe, which are chaired by the district attorney of Santa Barbara County and occur once per quarter.</p>\n<p>According to Labowe-Stoll, she also consistently attended Isla Vista Community Network meetings that occur once per month, along with Isla Vista Community Services District (CSD) meetings that occur once every two weeks.</p>\n<p>“I pride myself in being the voice of the students. I think EVPLAs have chosen to take on different aspects of their position, but that’s one that I really take pride in,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p><em>Nexus </em>reporters, who attend almost every CSD meeting, reported seeing Labowe-Stoll on an occasional basis.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <em>Nexus, </em>Labowe-Stoll also reflected on Deltopia, which she believes was a success.</p>\n<p>“I think that UCIV and the volunteer base that they’ve cultivated has really helped the process, and I think that being able to help UCIV and the Public Safety Commission with resources and my time has really been valuable to me and to them, too,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p>“I take a lot of pride in the fact that we’ve been able to really make Deltopia into a much more positive and safe environment,” she added. “From my perspective, I think it was definitely a win.”</p>\n<p>While citation and arrest numbers dropped this year at Deltopia, the number of medical transports <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/deltopia-attendance-medical-emergencies-rise/\">increased. </a></p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll also said she has been involved with the Measure R campaign and strongly encourages everyone in her office to volunteer their time through canvassing.</p>\n<p>“A.S. takes a very different role in this in the sense that we can’t outright advocate for or against it because of the constraints that we have, but I try to educate people as much as I can,” Labowe-Stoll said. “Obviously I want Measure R to pass very much, I think that it is kind of the final step in the CSD to be able to have this funding to distribute back to the community.”</p>\n<p>She also provided details as to why certain aspects of her platform were not completed.</p>\n<p>Her platform included creating a “Rate My Landlord” website, which would have allowed students to rank and comment on landlords in Isla Vista. She later discovered that there were legal issues regarding students commenting freely on their landlords, as it could lead to lawsuits based on slander.</p>\n<p>She also wanted to create a community court, which would have been an I.V. based program that allowed students charged with minor misdemeanors to deal with officials in I.V. instead of being sent to downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll was unable to complete the project and said she “realized how big it was” and how much legal attention it required as she began to speak to Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann.</p>\n<p>“This was something that I was going to work with Joan Hartmann on. We connected on it a lot at the beginning of the year and I think she got busy and it also kind of fell through,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p>Another one of Labowe-Stoll’s goals was to institute a parking system where specific parking spots in I.V. could be identified along sidewalks, which would ensure more parking places, but said the project would be postponed until Measure R comes to a vote.</p>\n<p>“[Parking] is a CSD power, and it involves a lot of time and money in terms of running surveys and that kind of stuff,” Labowe-Stoll said. “When I started working on it in the beginning, they [the CSD] said ‘We want to work on it too, obviously it’s our power, but we don’t have any money, so let’s wait for the tax to pass,’ so it pretty much depends on the [Measure R] tax.”</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll’s platform also included having Hartmann hold regular office hours in Isla Vista, which was successful. Hartmann holds office hours once a month after the Isla Vista Community Network meetings.</p>\n<p>“I honestly, truly attempted everything I put on my platform,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p>Jeike Meijer was elected to be EVPLA for the 2018-19 school year.</p>\n<p><em>Updated 4:01 p.m.: This article was updated to include information about the EVPLA-elect, Jeike Meijer. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version on this article appeared on pg.4 of the May 17, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

The student was running as an executive candidate in the spring A.S. election, according to the email.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> began to investigate the matter immediately but was unable to confirm which candidate the anonymous sender referred to.</p>\n<p>After the <em>Nexus</em> published its <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/mayela-morales-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">endorsement of Morales</a>, the editorial board began to receive other complaints about organizational conflicts during the student lobby visits. These complaints were from three anonymous sources that worked with Morales in preparation for these conferences.</p>\n<p>Morales was the internal director of Lobby Corps as well as a member of USSA, which organized both lobbying trips.</p>\n<p>While the <em>Nexus</em> editorial board was aware of complaints against an executive candidate prior to writing the endorsement, we needed confirmation through evidence and documentation to retract our choice. Our endorsement of Morales was based on an extensive interview process and a discussion with the editorial board.</p>\n<p>Based on Morales’s interview and other involvement on campus, we do believe Morales is the right person for the position; however, our investigation into the lobbying trip conflicts has led us to retract our endorsement.</p>\n<p>According to documents obtained by the <em>Nexus</em>, Morales failed to communicate with a colleague about transportation to the Sacramento lobby visit. The failure to communicate with the colleague in a timely manner resulted in a failure to organize the transportation.</p>\n<p>Further documents obtained by the <em>Nexus</em> on Tuesday, April 24, revealed Morales’s failure to complete the tasks she volunteered to do for a Washington, D.C. lobby visit, resulting in the untimely scheduling of flights and hotel accommodations.</p>\n<p>“<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the beginning of planning the conference, I informed the EVPSA that I was having problems with my phone because it had been in repairs for a minute. As I couldn’t afford to buy a new phone, I told everyone involved in planning the conference that I would be providing my support during my individual meetings with them, rather than over text,” </span>Morales told the <em>Nexus</em> in a statement.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since the beginning of 2018, due to some family financial issues, I haven’t had phone service which has made communication, at times, impossible. This is something every person I work with has been aware of since the beginning,” Morales added in the statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As colleagues and friends, the other people involved in the planning of the trips were aware of some of the mental health related issues I was personally going through at the time,” Morales also said in the statement. </span></p>\n<p>The editorial board believes it is best to formally retract the endorsement of Mayela Morales for the executive position. We apologize for our endorsement in light of this new information.</p>\n<p><em>Update: This article was updated to include a statement from Morales regarding her communication while organizing the lobby visits.  </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82722\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/nexus-retracts-evpsa-endorsement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82722\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/nexus-retracts-evpsa-endorsement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/nexus-retracts-evpsa-endorsement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/nexus-retracts-evpsa-endorsement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/nexus-retracts-evpsa-endorsement/","id":2281,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2280,2279,2278],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
