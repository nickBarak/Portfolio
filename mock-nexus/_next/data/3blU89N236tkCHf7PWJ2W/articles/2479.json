UCen Dining is initially offering the cage-free option at catered events and wants to eventually source all meat products from humanely treated farm animals.</p>\n<p>According to John Lazarus, assistant director of production and catering for UCen Dining, catering services will soon begin working with Mary’s Global Animal Partnership and conduct regular assessments of how source animals are cared.</p>\n<p>Mary’s is a free-range chicken farm that uses Controlled Atmosphere Stunning (CAS) euthanasia for a gentler slaughtering process. CAS slowly drains the oxygen from the birds’ confinement to make their death less stressful before the slaughtering operation.</p>\n<p>“It’s cage-free, but it’s a little bit more than cage-free,” Lazarus said. “There’s a bunch of different types of certifications … People go to inspect how the hens are being treated as they’re being raised.”</p>\n<p>The move away from factory farms will create higher costs for purchasing food, but Lazarus hopes to convince students and faculty that “it’s an investment worth making” that will lead to better living conditions for farm animals.</p>\n<p>“Catering has the ability to absorb prices a little better than the retail units, so we’re really sensitive to not raising prices on a bowl of soup at Coral Tree Café or a sandwich at the Arbor because we know that students are already stretching their money as far as they possibly can,” Lazarus said.</p>\n<p>According to Andrew deCoriolis, Farm Forward’s director of strategic programs and engagement, reducing portion sizes will lower the costs of higher quality food and the transition to a more sustainable, vegetarian meal plan can result in less expensive animal products while also ensuring animals lived a decent life before dying.</p>\n<p>The total cost comparison between factory farms and cage-free farms is unavailable at this time and will be released in the fall.</p>\n<p>Lazarus said that the project was inspired by a variety of concerns, including the environmental impact and health concerns that arise from eating too much meat.</p>\n<p>“When you have a bunch of hens raised in a factory farm, it’s incredibly efficient but it also concentrates waste and concentrates byproducts and they’re not allowed to permeate through the soil in a natural way,” Lazarus said.</p>\n<p>However, he said the biggest motivation for the project is a “moral obligation” to decrease animal cruelty in the meat and dairy industry.</p>\n<p>“It’s not really directly connected to sustainability and nutrition, it’s more about how … we treat animals, and, to me, those are morally equivalent,” Lazarus said.</p>\n<p>A California law passed in January 2015 required an increase in space allocation for factory farm chickens. Another law, AB-1437, banned the selling of eggs from chickens raised in small, wire “battery” cages with limited space.</p>\n<p>However, Farm Forward and UCen Dining are still concerned with the animals’ living conditions in the factory farm industry, as many factories do not give birds outdoor access, and some slaughter their animals by hanging them upside down and electrocuting them.</p>\n<p>According to deCoriolis, over 90 percent of American poultry is raised on factory farms.</p>\n<p>“[The program is] led because students and employees are saying [that] ‘we want better products, we want more plants, we want fewer animals,’” deCoriolis said. “‘And if we are going to eat animals, we want to eat animals that are raised in really great ways.’”</p>\n<p>DeCoriolis said he believes that the move from factory farms will be possible at UCSB due to its reputation as a sustainable and environmentally aware campus.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been working with … several of the UCs to help them look at their supply chain and look at the kind of products that they buy and serve and help them understand what those products really look like and understand whether or not those products align with their institutional values,” deCoriolis said.</p>\n<p>Audrey Horn, second-year biopsychology major, has been working with Lazarus and deCoriolis to implement the changes into the UCen catering services. She became involved with the program after learning about the ways factory farm animals were raised and slaughtered.</p>\n<p>Horn said she hopes more students realize the harmful ways animals are being handled on factory farms and plans to connect with movements at other universities for improved farm animal treatment.</p>\n<p>“Students have a serious impact, but we don’t realize it,” Horn said. “Everything we’re doing, and everything that’s going on, so much more can happen if more students knew about it. Changes will happen at UCSB if the students want changes to happen.”</p>\n<p>Horn said the push for cruelty-free farms will not stop with cage-free eggs.</p>\n<p>“Cage-free is a step, which is really exciting, but that’s not the final goal,” Horn said. “The final goal is to be certified humane … the best of the best quality.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, May

Urban Orchard was launched in cooperation with singer Jack Johnson and his wife Kim Johnson in 2015.</p>\n<p>The food bank has already harvested some of the trees’ first fruits, and production is expected to increase with the addition of four more trees this spring.</p>\n<p>“We work to reimagine certain spaces on our campus that aren’t being used or that are underutilized into areas of sustainable food production,” said Maile Hartsook, fourth-year political science major and intern for ECP.</p>\n<p>The group’s goal is to produce approximately 25,000 pounds of food each year to donate to the A.S. Food Bank.</p>\n<p>Also known as aeroponic gardening, transforming large, unused concrete spaces into vertical gardens maximizes space and water.</p>\n<p>A small pump at the base of the structure sends nutrient-rich water up to the top level. As the water trickles back down, it soaks the plants’ roots along the way and becomes oxygenated.</p>\n<p>The extra oxygen in the water boosts the roots’ nutrient absorption capability, causing the plants to grow faster with less water and less space.</p>\n<p>DPW will be maintaining and harvesting the urban orchards, vertical gardens and the future campus farm which will be created in West Campus. Originating in 2004 as part of A.S. Recycling, the DPW became their own program in 2012.</p>\n<p>In any given month, DPW will collect up to 4,000 pounds of pre-consumer compostable waste, primarily from the dining commons, to feed the worms that live in compost allocations.</p>\n<p>“Since we collect the food and make compost, we want to continue the cycle and grow more food for the compost,” Marli Heininger, the outreach coordinator for DPW, said. “Once we have a location set out, we are going to be the workers on the campus farm and the food will go to the student food bank.”</p>\n<p>UCSB puts all non-compostable waste into a landfill that was built in the 1960s, but Heininger said it is predicted to be unusable in about 10 years.</p>\n<p>Landfills are breeding grounds for methane-producing microorganisms, and UCSB’s landfill contains technology that harvests about 75 percent of the methane produced and uses it to power 3,000 Goleta households.</p>\n<p>The methane that enters the atmosphere, however, has approximately 21 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide and stays in the atmosphere for about 12.5 years.</p>\n<p>“By composting, in the short term, we can make a really big difference in greenhouse gas emissions and climate change if we all just compost more,” Heininger said.</p>\n<p>To further emphasize the interconnectedness of our campus’s sustainability cycle, Jake Whisenant, worm caretaker and composter at DPW, said the Daily Nexus’ use of soy-based ink in printing makes it possible to recycle nearly 150 pounds of unused papers every week.</p>\n<p>Gesturing to a sample bin of worms nibbling on words in the shredded newspapers, Heininger added, “They’re eating ‘Justin Bieber’ right now.”</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: This article initially said that methane stays in the atmosphere for 100 years. It actually remains in the atmosphere for approximately 12.5 years.]</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, May 19, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily

Currently, 18 UCSB students have been named E.S.T.E.E.M. scholars and are receiving scholarship money.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74795\" style=\"width: 2855px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170110_205327.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1137029041\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74793\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74795\" data-attachment-id=\"74795\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/engineers-get-new-funding/20170110_205327/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170110_205327.jpg?fit=2845%2C1909&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2845,1909\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"20170110_205327\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170110_205327.jpg?fit=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170110_205327.jpg?fit=888%2C596&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-74795\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170110_205327.jpg?resize=888%2C596\" alt=\"Lissette Vaca / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"596\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170110_205327.jpg?w=2845&amp;ssl=1 2845w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170110_205327.jpg?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170110_205327.jpg?resize=768%2C515&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170110_205327.jpg?resize=1024%2C687&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170110_205327.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170110_205327.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74795\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lissette Vaca / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Students in community colleges can also apply for E.S.T.E.E.M. scholarships, regardless of whether they plan to attend UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We hope that by getting to know us from this program, more [community college students] will come here,” Scott said.</p>\n<p>The grants are determined by financial need, grade-point average, a letter of recommendation and a personal statement written by the students.</p>\n<p>“Another big part of it is the financial need,” Scott said. “That’s actually a NSF requirement; they want to give these scholarships to academically talented low income students.”</p>\n<p>Not many students applied for the first round of scholarships, which Scott attributes to the low turnaround time and lack of exposure. She said there will be another round of scholarships awarded during Winter Quarter, followed by annual awards for the next five years.</p>\n<p>They hope that by providing scholarship money, students will be able to devote more time to studying and campus life rather than working to help pay for tuition.</p>\n<p>Though 65 percent of the grant goes toward scholarships, money is also allocated toward tutors and networking events as well as research done by the Gevirtz School of Education to determine what the obstacles are to student success and what steps UCSB can take to help ensure their success.</p>\n<p>“Eventually we hope to set up some pilot programs which involve co-teaching a few key gateway courses at UCSB and at the community colleges, which gives the transfer students sort of more of a head start in adapting to the UCSB environment,” Scott said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

A bright mustard yellow, this one-story structure houses the elusive College of Creative Studies (CCS).</p>\n<p>With about 350 students in the entire college, CCS reflects a very small but unique percentage of UCSB undergraduates.</p>\n<p>Though one of only three colleges here at UCSB, CCS is the most abstract in terms of research and academics. Students within this program only need eight general education (GE) requirements for their major, can drop a class up until the day before a final and do not receive grades for classes taken within the College of Creative Studies.</p>\n<p>CCS students typically enroll in both CCS and College of Letters &amp; Sciences (L&amp;S) courses each quarter, but Ezra Kosviner, first-year chemistry/biochemistry CCS major, said he appreciates the more relaxed feel of a CCS class.</p>\n<p>“Because you know you’re not taking it for a grade, you’re generally interested in the class,” Kosviner said. “There’s no great benefit to you other than to learn.”</p>\n<p>Students are awarded units based on their academic performance, ranging from zero to six units depending on the quality of their assignments, participation and attendance.</p>\n<p>Although CCS students rely on L&amp;S courses to create their GPA, CCS is a rigorous and research-oriented program. Tengiz Bibilashvili, professor and advisor for the CCS physics major, explains that the introductory class for physics contains multiple elements of upper-division classes.</p>\n<p>He adds that many juniors take graduate-level classes and start research during their freshman and sophomore years.</p>\n<p>“CCS classes go much deeper, are more in-depth,” Bibilashvili said. To stay and succeed in the CCS physics program, Bibilashvili said students must be “sick with physics.”</p>\n<p>“They must be people who love science, who love physics, who just don’t count the time they spend solving problems,” he said.</p>\n<p>Talon Stark, second-year CCS mathematics major, agrees.</p>\n<p>“More than anything, it lets you dedicate all of your time on your own discipline,” Stark said.</p>\n<p>Some CCS students say they encounter misconceptions of elitism, competitiveness and lack of structure regarding CCS among their peers. Emma Horanic, first-year CCS biology major, said she worries that CCS students are assumed to have an easier route to academic success.</p>\n<p>Horanic noted that although CCS students have more opportunities for individual attention, they are not handed connections for research and projects.</p>\n<p>“You have to put in the effort to make that connection; advisors don’t automatically do it for you,” Horanic said.</p>\n<p>Anoop Praturu, first-year CCS physics major, said the CCS program is more collaborative than competitive.</p>\n<p>“There’s no shame in going to someone and saying, ‘Yo, I don’t get this shit, can you help me out?’” Praturu said. “There’s no shame in asking for help.”</p>\n<p>While the CCS students have much more freedom in choosing classes tailored specifically to their interests, they also have additional guidance in planning schedules and identifying career goals. Each student is assigned an advisor who is also a researcher or professor in their area of interest.</p>\n<p>Gabby Najm, second-year CCS biology major, is graduating at the end of next year and seeks to pursue fieldwork. Najm said she feels very supported in this program by professors.</p>\n<p>“They just want you to succeed to the best of your ability, and they know you have it in you to do well,” Najm said.</p>\n<p>In terms of academic preparation, Bibilashvili said that, for undergraduates, research depends more on one’s skillset rather than on one’s college enrollment.</p>\n<p>“Professors don’t care what label is on your jacket, CCS or [Letters &amp; Science]. It doesn’t matter,” Bibilashvili said. “If you are prepared in research, they will take you.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, May 19, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71153\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/students-find-a-home-in-ucsbs-smallest-college/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71153\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/students-find-a-home-in-ucsbs-smallest-college/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/students-find-a-home-in-ucsbs-smallest-college/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/students-find-a-home-in-ucsbs-smallest-college/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/students-find-a-home-in-ucsbs-smallest-college/","id":2478,"author":{"id":111,"name":"Annie Golay"},"related":[2477,2476,2475],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
