Commission on Student Well Being (COSWB) co-hosted an event titled “Stigma Free UCSB” at Storke Plaza Thursday to educate students about mental health issues and on-campus resources for students.</p>\n<p>From 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., more than 12 organizations, including I.V. Food Co-op, C.A.P.S., RHA, C.A.R.E., A.S. Food Bank, Student Health and EDAS, tabled to educate students and encourage dialogue about mental health. Attendees participated in four activities including jumping on a sheet of bubble wrap covered with stigmatizing comments called “Stomp Out Stigma” and filling a sandbox with sand representing different illnesses. Participants could also write encouraging comments on a wall called “Stigma Free Wall” and on a mirror called the “Body Positive Mirror” while listening to a live music performance by UCSB alumnus Erisy Watt.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major and Active Minds Co-President Melissa Boomer said her favorite event was the Stigma Free Sandbox.</p>\n<p>“The Stigma Free sandbox … is where we have five different colors of sand, each corresponds to a different phrase regarding stigma and mental health, like, ‘I support those with mental illness,’ or, ‘I suffer from mental illness,’ and stuff like that,” Boomer said. “They make a little plastic container filled with the colorful sands, and they decorate it with seashells so they have a little memento to take home today.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and accounting double-major and COSWB co-chair Kim Liao said COSWB got involved with the event to increase their focus on students’ mental well-being.</p>\n<p>“We realize that mental health is an issue for many students here, and there’s a stigma to talk about it, to reach out,” Liao said. “So I think it’s really great that we get to participate in this and co-sponsor this event and spread more awareness for mental health.”</p>\n<p>Liao said COSWB created a board of Polaroid photos from the event, showcasing students holding pre-made signs to be displayed in Pardall Center.</p>\n<p>“We put Polaroid pictures up of people holding a sign that says … ‘I’m not defined by my insecurities,’ or, ‘I don’t live in my body image issues,’ things like that. There’s no stigma to put it out there and to tell everybody else that you’re not alone,” Liao said. “Some people just put really nice quotes in there that brightens peoples’ days, like, ‘You’re beautiful,’ and, ‘You’re loved.’ I think it’s a really sweet thing.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66667\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"134320978\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66684\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66667\" data-attachment-id=\"66667\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/stigma-free-ucsb-held-to-promote-understanding-of-mental-health-issues-on-campus-resources/minds_-by-alex-payne-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"7.1\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447893851\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Active Minds Stigma Free\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66667\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1-250x167.jpg?resize=400%2C267\" alt=\"Alex Payne/Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66667\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Alex Payne/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to second-year psychology major Marisa Jones, one in four Americans will struggle with a mental health issue within a year, and one in two will within their lifetime.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people who don’t take anxiety seriously, [they often say] ‘Oh, depression is just in your head,’ [they] treat it as something that you can just snap your fingers and fix and say ‘Just smile and your depression will go away,’” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Jones said while she was speaking to attendees about kids struggling with depression, someone began to say the phrase, “if I had a normal kid…”</p>\n<p>“That just broke my heart, because there are children out there who do have mental illnesses, and so that’s a kid starting at 10 years old being told that they’re not normal,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Jones said she hopes Stigma Free UCSB will help resolve mental health issues on campus.</p>\n<p>“We have so many thousands of people on campus, and we’re trying to make sure that we can get more stigma fighters one by one and that this is a big issue and that we need to fight the stigma,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Santa Catalina north tower Co-President and first-year undeclared major Tom Steel said RHA tabled to teach students living in residence halls about finding help on campus and to show them they are not alone.</p>\n<p>“We are [telling] them the safe spots around campus, different ways to get involved,” Steel said. “Different resources if you or if anybody you know is having any struggles.”</p>\n<p>UCSB alumnus and C.A.P.S. Mental Health Specialist Gladys Koscak said the most important takeaway for attendees is recognizing how prevalent mental health issues are in society.</p>\n<p>“It’s usually not until someone has a personal experience with someone who’s had depression or anxiety that people start to really understand what the impact of that can really be on people,” Koscak said. “People can be very high-functioning and still be struggling in silence.”</p>\n<p>UCSB alumnus and singer Erisy Watt said she enjoys performing at events where people unite to support each other.</p>\n<p>“Everybody who’s here really highlights the wonderful things about Isla Vista and our community, and I think that’s what this area in particular needs. It’s a strong community to just support each other and help each other and make it a more beautiful and happy place,” Watt said. “I’m happy to be able to provide sound, music for such a great community gathering.”</p>\n<p>Watt said she performed Jack Johnson and Paul Simon songs, but most of what she played were original compositions.</p>\n<p>Watt said one of her favorite lyrics from her original piece “Thailand Story” is “the wildness of the earth is the wildness in me.”</p>\n<p>“I really liked playing that song because I like to spread that message that there’s the wildness that we see, there’s the forest and the ocean that are these vast things in nature on the planet. We come from the same place, so it’s fun to recognize that in ourselves,” Watt said. “Sometimes we get so ‘Oh, I have a job’ and this and that, but I like to remind myself that I’m very much a part of this wild, crazy planet that we live on.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

The top 400 wealthiest individuals, 400 Americans, have wealth equivalent to the bottom 150,000,000 citizens.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smiley also said humanity is being threatened by racism, patriarchy, ageism and sexism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In this age, in 2015, even in the era of the nation’s first black president, even in the era of the potentially first woman president, there are still too many citizens every day trying to live lives where their humanity is being contested,” Smiley said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smiley also defended his criticism of President Barack Obama, saying all presidents should be equally criticized.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I believe in holding all leaders accountable … I will always protect our president, but when he is wrong, I will correct my president,” Smiley said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smiley said the current generation of black youth face a more difficult future than that of their parents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Blacks over the past 10 years have lost ground … our ancestors must be turning in their graves,” Smiley said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Smiley, effective leadership required putting others before oneself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can’t lead people unless you love, and you can’t save people unless you serve,” Smiley said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discussing Martin Luther King Jr.’s identification of racism, poverty and militarism and its current relevance in the U.S., Smiley said love is a universally qualifying standard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Love means that everyone is worthy just because … that’s it, just because,” Smiley said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

id=\"caption-attachment-66584\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Spencer Brandt/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov discussed his experience leading the pro-democracy movement against Russian president Vladimir Putin in a lecture titled “Winter is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped” in Campbell Hall Tuesday evening.</p>\n<p>Garry Kasparov was born in the Soviet Union in 1963 and rose to international fame at the age of 22 when he became the youngest world chess champion in 1985. He grew increasingly politically active in 2005 and in 2008 ran against Putin in the Russian Presidential race. Kasparov shared about his experience as a political activist and why he thinks Putin is a global threat.</p>\n<p>Kasparov said when he began winning chess games, he realized he had a sense of responsibility to his country as a champion to address the political changes in Russia.</p>\n<p>“Winning the championship, I had some kind of responsibility,” Kasparov said. “I had to demonstrate to people that when Kasparov won, there was going to be change.”</p>\n<p>Kasparov said he does not know what the future holds for the power struggles between Putin and the free world, but Putin will be focused on remaining in power as democracies attempt to compromise with him.</p>\n<p>“Putin thinks about survival,” Kasparov said. “The free world is searching so desperately for common ground, democracies are slow to respond and they need strategy.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>[Putin’s] interest is in the opposition of the free world. He can’t afford stability because then he has to compete — he’s a loser.<br>\n<em>– Garry Kasparov</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Kasparov said he was disappointed with how President George H.W. Bush and President Obama intervened in Russian politics and said Putin has benefited from their “inadequate approaches.”</p>\n<p>“Bush did too much, Obama has done nothing,” Kasparov said. “They always believe the Soviet Union after the Cold War could have been better. [Putin] could benefit from that general belief of working together.”</p>\n<p>Kasparov said he believes Putin is uninterested in finding common ground with the free world because he knows he will be unable to compete with it.</p>\n<p>“[Putin’s] interest is in the opposition of the free world,” Kasparov said. “He can’t afford stability because then he has to compete — he’s a loser.”</p>\n<p>Kasparov said he rejects the idea that Putin’s strategy is like a game of chess. According to Kasparov, chess is a game of rules and Putin does not abide by rules.</p>\n<p>“Putin is not playing chess because it’s a transparent game,” Kasparov said. “He plays a different game because he can win by bluffing. He can win by bluffing and blackmail.”</p>\n<p>Kasparov said Putin can be “defeated” when Russian citizens believe he is no longer powerful.</p>\n<p>“Putin must demonstrate that he is no longer invincible,” Kasparov said. “The system must look weak in the eyes of his subjects. It’s all about political will that is so far not here. Putin is indispensible because everyone thinks he’s indispensable.”</p>\n<p>Kasparov said about “30 percent” of his life is now dedicated to chess, and he enjoys it because it possesses the rules that politics lack.</p>\n<p>“It helps keep my brain in good shape,” Kasparov said. “Chess has rules. I feel more confident when I play by the rules.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year history major Audrey Dalton said the most notable topic from the lecture was the idea that “dictators need enemies.”</p>\n<p>“I feel that sums up a lot of what [Kasparov] said. That’s why Putin is going to keep persecuting and starting wars in other places because he needs to justify his existence,” Dalton said. “Kasparov clearly has an informed opinion.”</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Diana Hernandez said she was interested in learning more about Putin to understand Kasparov’s actions.</p>\n<p>“I had a basic overview, but I don’t know that much about it, so that’s why I wanted to come,” Hernandez said. “I want to know the details of Kasparov’s decision, what he stands for and why is he against Putin.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year German and economics double-major Michael Göpper said he is interested in Russian politics because of Germany’s geographical proximity to Russia.</p>\n<p>“About the topic of Russian politics, I think I know quite a lot from reading German newspaper, because Russia’s not too far away from Germany or Europe in general,” Göpper said. “I’m really interested in Russian politics and Russian foreign relations and the issues that are involved in that.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Previously, UCSB students held a sit-in to establish a more concrete policy in regard to sexual violence procedures and policies. Though this policy has been implemented and revised, a meeting was held on Wednesday to consider how recent changes will affect the student body and student access to support programs. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Students, staff and administrators met in the UCen’s Santa Barbara Harbor Room on Wednesday to discuss recent changes to how UCSB will respond to reports of sexual violence.</p>\n<p>The group focused on evaluating the recently implemented UC-wide Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy and how it will affect UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming began the discussion by explaining the purpose of the meeting.</p>\n<p>“Our goal from the staff side of things is just to make sure that we have an opportunity for regular communication, that we have an opportunity to sit down and hear from you about your ideas and thoughts on things, if there are concerns you think we need to beware of,” Fleming said.</p>\n<p>Fleming said under UC policy, each campus has some freedom to determine implementation procedures.</p>\n<p>“That is actually something we have more control over are our own campus procedures, so we can go back, look at that and amend that,” Fleming said. “The policy is the policy for now. It has been embedded, system-wide it has been approved, it has been implemented as of Jan. 4, so we don’t have the ability to make any changes to the policy, but we do have the ability to make changes to the way we describe the implementation procedures, and we can clarify things that aren’t clear.”</p>\n<p>Briana Conway, victim advocacy specialist for C.A.R.E. Advocate Office for Sexual and Gender Based Violence and Sexual Misconduct program at UCSB, said the policy is clear for reports of a student perpetrator, but other procedures need further specification.</p>\n<p>“I think phase two of that and ongoing will be really fleshing out what are the procedures when any one party is a non-affiliate and how do we work through next steps and action items as far as recording for that,” Conway said.</p>\n<p>Timothy Irvine, vice president for Committees and Planning of the Graduate Students Association, said a flow chart for procedures on student reports could be useful.</p>\n<p>“If that could be adopted here and accessible, but accessible without students having to go into C.A.R.E., so on a website or something, so if something has happened they don’t necessarily have to go in and consult with someone to get clarity on what the process might look like. I think that would be great,” Irvine said.</p>\n<p>Irvine said websites explaining the procedures can potentially be difficult to navigate.</p>\n<p>“Certainly if you know how to navigate these things, you can find what to do depending on what your situation is, and if you go to C.A.R.E., it is really easy to report and call C.A.R.E. and go into C.A.R.E., but that is not necessarily what everyone wants to do.”</p>\n<p>Suzanne Perkin, assistant dean for student life at the Office of Judicial Affairs, said the C.A.R.E. Advocate Office is preparing a one-page document to distribute to students.</p>\n<p>“We are working on a summary and overview one-page document on this process, so that is something that could just be handed out,” Perkin said. “Then we were thinking about, on the back, putting the flow chart.”</p>\n<p>Conway said there should be a balance of transparency and privacy in the reporting and advocacy processes.</p>\n<p>“What is that happy medium? We can put it all out there for transparency, and, yes, I fully support that. But I don‘t want it to ever lose the beautiful bond that an advocate can provide and help a survivor navigate their options,” Conway said. “That is the core value of why I wake up every morning.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, February 4, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67922\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/ucsb-examines-revised-sexual-violence-policy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67922\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/ucsb-examines-revised-sexual-violence-policy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/ucsb-examines-revised-sexual-violence-policy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/ucsb-examines-revised-sexual-violence-policy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/ucsb-examines-revised-sexual-violence-policy/","id":2618,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2617,2616,2615],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
