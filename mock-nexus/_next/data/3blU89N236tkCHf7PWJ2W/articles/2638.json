The minor currently provides an interdisciplinary examination of the lives, experiences, identities and representations of LGBTQ individuals. Students seeking the LGBTQ studies minor will take feminist studies courses in addition to a variety of interdisciplinary courses.</p>\n<p>Tyburczy said she wants the minor to connect with social issues from around the world and focus on LGBTQ developments within the UCSB student population.</p>\n<p>“Top priorities will include strengthening the intersections of gender and sexuality studies with race, ethnicity, class, and disability studies from a national and transnational lens, forging new social justice and scholarly ties across disciplines,” Tyburczy said in an email.</p>\n<p>Tyburczy said the minor is expanding with two new courses being offered during next Winter quarter and one new course during Spring quarter.</p>\n<p>“I will offer two new courses this winter: an upper-division undergraduate course called ‘Trans-Art’ that will explore transgender, genderqueer, and gender fluid artists and artworks across genres and geographies in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries and a queer theory graduate course,” Tyburczy said in email. “In the spring, I will offer an undergraduate version of queer theory.”</p>\n<p>According to Tyburczy, the minor will be tailored to better prepare the student body for future careers in a variety of fields.</p>\n<p>“Students will gain broad knowledge in a growing segment of the national and global population that remains little understood by mainstream institutions,” Tyburczy said in email. “This knowledge can be employed in a variety of arenas: from activism and public advocacy work, to the law and the health sciences, to the arts and educational environments.”</p>\n<p>Second-year communication major Ciara Baker, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, said the LGBTQ studies minor educates students on global issues concerning sexuality, gender and identities and understanding systematic marginalization through critical thinking.</p>\n<p>“I think the minor is important because it produces well-rounded students because of the intersectionality it covers and it also makes students more aware, so that they can be more inclusive and successful in any career that they choose,” Baker said in an email. “The LGBTQ minor allows UCSB students to broaden their field of study and understand race, gender, and other identities.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Madeline Stefani said she is pursuing the minor because it focuses on viewing “gender rigidity” as one of the main causes of inequality.</p>\n<p>“I think that it covers important movements in our history as humans that are not covered anywhere else and gives students the opportunity to explore social issues, especially ones relating to the LGBTQ community,” Stefani said in an email. “It’s another area of marginalization that is not really discussed in the history courses. I think it should be just as important as an ethnicity requirement.”</p>\n<p>Feminist studies professor Leila Rupp said many students pursue the minor to better understand the identities of their loved ones.</p>\n<p>“Some students do the minor for personal reasons, either because they are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer or have family members who are and want to understand the place of sexuality, in combination with other factors, in shaping life experiences,” Rupp said in an email.</p>\n<p>Rupp said students also enter the program to better recognize the problems of LGBTQ members in intellectual and career-oriented domains.</p>\n<p>“Some students pursue the minor for professional reasons, so that in their chosen careers they understand the lives, experiences, and identities of LGBTQ people,” Rupp said in an email. “And still others do the minor for primarily intellectual reasons, because they find the subject matter compelling.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story

of Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP), an international organization advocating an end to the “war on drugs” approach to substance control.</p>\n<p>Garcia, a second-year biology major, and Minoiefar, a third-year history of public policy major, aim to educate students on the war on drugs, explore alternative approaches and promote smart decisions regarding drug use. A group of students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst led by Shea Gunther founded SSDP in 1998, and the organization has grown to include thousands of members from hundreds of campuses worldwide.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s SSDP chapter is currently going through the campus organization registration process with the Office of Student life and seeking a faculty advisor, but has already been active on campus and has a club constitution. For a chapter to be officially recognized by the organization, it must have at least three students and actively organize on campus.</p>\n<p>Pacific outreach coordinator for SSDP Frances Fu said she can help connect SSDP efforts across campuses.</p>\n<p>“For example, the UC Davis chapter is currently spearheading a Good Samaritan policy at their school and would like to make it a statewide effort,” Fu said in an email. “Part of my job is facilitating those relationships and partnerships.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said he hopes to help install a local Good Samaritan policy, which would grant legal immunity to someone who calls the police or medical personnel for an injured person.</p>\n<p>“A lot of times a person’s friends or peers are scared of law enforcement and the repercussions that would come with calling an ambulance and getting the authorities involved,” Garcia said. “We’d like to make it easier for people who need help with drugs and alcohol to seek help for something like an overdose.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said he hopes to convey to students the many effects of national and local drug policy.</p>\n<p>“I’d like for SSDP to educate students on how drug policy is related to a variety of other social issues, like unemployment and the economy, education, health care and racial injustice,” Garcia said. “If students understand how reforming drug policy will improve society in these other areas, then they will understand how necessary drug policy reform actually is.”</p>\n<p>To publicize the new chapter, members have been tabling and handing out information around campus. Garcia plans to eventually hold documentary screenings and invite guest speakers to campus to discuss drug policy.</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Catherine Lee says that SSDP will be a good addition to UCSB’s campus organizations because many students do not understand the implications of drug policy and the effects of drug use.</p>\n<p>“It sounds similar to what we learned in AlcoholEdu online over the summer, but I think this program will be more successful in communicating messages to students if they do everything in person through things like guest speakers and events,” Lee said. “Unfortunately, I don’t think most students registered most of the information presented to them online in AlcoholEdu.”</p>\n<p>Minoiefar said he decided to create the UCSB chapter of SSDP because he felt not having a local Good Samaritan policy discourages students from aiding others in in dangerous situations to avoid legal repercussions.</p>\n<p>Like Garcia, Minoiefar said he would like to change local policy to encourage students to intervene in potentially dangerous situations.</p>\n<p>“A big thing the chapter can do is push a policy like the Good Samaritan policy at the university,” Minoiefar said. “The school can put in its policy that if you get help for someone in need … and if it is decided that a person did it in good faith, they won’t be in trouble.”</p>\n<p>As the new chapter of SSDP grows at UCSB, Minoiefar said he hopes to amass a big enough following to continue running the program once both co-founders graduate.</p>\n<p>“These types of initiatives, like the Good Samaritan policy, tend to die out when a student like me leaves because then all the information and things I’ve learned leave with me,” Minoiefar said. “By building this chapter, we hope to be able to create new student leaders who can continue this.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Each speaker will present an individual topic about the struggles and successes relating to recovery. Sponsors will offer resources and information to students, with organizers anticipating attendees from across the UC and out of state.</p>\n<p>UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program counselor and recovery specialist Angie Bryan said the conference can help break down preconceptions about the recovery process while creating a community for recovering students.</p>\n<p>“One goal is to bring students together in recovery just for fellowship and mutual support,” Bryan said. “We’re trying to promote awareness about being in recovery, and that people in recovery are assets to a college community … to reduce the stigma about being in recovery in college.”</p>\n<p>Bryan said the recovery movement began at UCSB four years ago with the assistance of UC Riverside and has grown into a UC-wide program for addiction recovery.</p>\n<p>“I think initially the goal was to help start the movement in California,” Bryan said. “Four years ago, we were just starting our program here and Riverside had a student group, but there wasn’t else much happening in our state. Now we have collegiate recovery programs at most of the UCs.”</p>\n<p>Second-year psychology major and recovery intern for Gauchos for Recovery Adam Daar said UC Riverside supports UCSB in hosting the event.</p>\n<p>“UC Riverside wanted to keep it student led, and I think that people liked the idea of bringing it to Santa Barbara because they saw that we had a strong collegiate recovery program community already,” Daar said. “We are really happy to be able to do this.”</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year global studies major and recovery intern for Gauchos for Recovery Emily Bills, recovery programs have been growing rapidly in recent years and UCSB has one of the best programs to host the conference.</p>\n<p>“There are only so many recovery programs in California that are able to host. We have a huge support from the Alcohol and Drug Program that no other schools really have,” Bills said.</p>\n<p>According to Director of UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program Jackie Kurta, the process of recovery will be destigmatized throughout the conference. Kurta said she hopes this will lead to more acknowledgement and support for recovering students.</p>\n<p>“I think there are assumptions made about how college students lead their lives,” Kurta said. “There’s stigma about people being in recovery or students who were struggling and not yet able to make a choice that is working well for them. I think our community needs to be more sensitive to being helpful and supportive and not being judging and off-putting in that way.”</p>\n<p>Kurta said the conference will also showcase UCSB’s efforts to improve the lives of students dealing with addiction and recovery.</p>\n<p>“We all saw it as a terrific opportunity to bring attention to the work that is being done and to applaud the efforts of the program and to bring some recognition to our campus, because people don’t always think of UCSB and sober living,” Kurta said. “It was an opportunity to say we have a thriving program, we have a very diverse community and our community can include students in recovery.”</p>\n<p>Daar said he hopes the conference can help unify colleges and create diverse alcohol and drug programs at different universities.</p>\n<p>“I think something the conference can do is [help] other schools with their recovery program and learn about our own and cultivate a space of learning … and expand the national recovery movement, especially on college campuses,” Daar said.</p>\n<p>Daar said all students and UCSB staff are welcome to attend the conference and can volunteer for the event to learn about recovery.</p>\n<p>“They can reach out to us and sign up for volunteer shifts,” Daar said. “They get free admission and are welcome to help out and attend the entire conference — they get all the information that is really guided for students.”</p>\n<p>Daar said if students are struggling with an addiction they should seek help and know that recovery teams are there for support.</p>\n<p>“Try really hard to not be afraid to ask for help. Know that no one in this recovery community is going to judge you for asking for help,” Daar said. “They can come to us to ask for help and they will be welcomed with open arms. I want them to know that.”</p>\n<p>Bryan said the resources offered at the conference can be of help to anyone affected by addiction.</p>\n<p>“I just want to emphasize that everybody is touched by addiction in some way, whether it’s personally or [through] a friend or family member,” Bryan said. “I think that anyone could get something out of the conference.”</p>\n<p>The Alcohol and Drug Program offers weekly meetings open to all community members and hosts quarterly events. Services are primarily free to all students, including resources for being an ally in recovery.</p>\n<p>For more information about the conference and registration, visit

Lingerie,” describing the post-9/11 lives of six Pakistani-American Muslim women Friday at 8 p.m. at the MCC Theater.</p>\n<p>Fatima’s play intertwines sex, politics and religion as the six women discuss their lives during a heavily Islamophobic time in America while drying their lingerie. The play aims to dispel stereotypes of Muslim culture and women.</p>\n<p>MCC Programmer Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said the event represents ideals the MCC aims to promote.</p>\n<p>“This play was really hot — up and coming,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “It fit within the narrative and algorithm that the MCC uses, that intersection of diversity, relativity and being current.”</p>\n<p>Mohsenian-Rahman said the purpose of the show is to educate UCSB students about the often negatively portrayed culture of Pakistani women.</p>\n<p>“There is such a heightened sense of Islamophobia and aggression towards anyone in proximity to that faith in this country that I think anything that you can utilize to cut down at that kind of aggression is beneficial,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “I think that a play like this might hit the mark for some in breaking down those barriers, and perhaps not for others.”</p>\n<p>Muslim Student Association (MSA) member and third-year CCS literature major Heeba Kaleem said because Fatima is Muslim, her performance will offer an accurate perspective on what it is like to be stereotyped.</p>\n<p>“It’s not just someone who doesn’t know anything about Muslim culture or may have stereotypical understandings of what being a Muslim in America is like, so I’m happy there’s some kind of story being told,” Kaleem said.</p>\n<p>MSA member and third-year economics and math major Nihal Hakim said he thought the title of the play is offensive to Pakistani people.</p>\n<p>“At first when I saw the event name, “Dirty Paki Lingerie,” my first hang up was on just the name, or the use of the word Paki,” Hakim said. “Paki is a racial slur, especially in the UK, but also to a certain degree in the U.S. It’s a word that really brings down a whole community of people.”</p>\n<p>Hakim said the image on flyers for the event of Fatima holding piece of lingerie while wearing a hijab is a false image of what it is like to be a Pakistani woman.</p>\n<p>“It relies on the stereotypes of the Muslim woman — the Pakistani woman — being somewhat different and that difference being an oppression and that oppression can only be alleviated by a very specific type of post-colonial westernization,” Hakim said.</p>\n<p>Mohsenian-Rahman said she encourages people to watch the show with an open mind despite the backlash from students and alumni.</p>\n<p>“I would encourage them to think twice and come to the event to think about what the ultimate goals of the play really are,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “It’s not necessarily perpetuation; she’s not trying to participate in stereotyping ourselves or themselves or yourselves, she’s trying to combat them.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
