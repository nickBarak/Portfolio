Senator Kian Maalizadeh authored the resolution to provide funding for students unable to travel home because of financial issues. <em>Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kian Maalizadeh, transfer senator and fourth-year biology major, created the resolution on Dec. 8. Ilene Ochoa, an off-campus senator and fourth-year communication major, seconded the resolution, which was later passed through an email vote on Dec. 10.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email votes are usually used only in emergency situations, Maalizadeh said. Senators used an email vote because the fire grew quickly after their last planned meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the resolution, the Senate will take $5,000 from their unallocated fund which is made up of student fees, and a detailed list of what was purchased will be sent back to Associated Students (A.S.). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maalizadeh said the resolution was made intentionally vague because he anticipates that many  unforeseen problems could arise during the fire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he created the resolution because he wanted to show A.S.’s support for the students affected by the fire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of students were calling UC admin saying they couldn’t leave, they couldn’t afford to leave; they were stuck, basically in the pollution,” Maalizadeh said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said A.S. released polls asking students if they needed aid to get off campus, and the overall response was “yes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The deadline to request funds was 10:30 a.m. on Dec. 14 so that the Financial Crisis Response Team could process checks in a “timely manner,” according to Maalizadeh. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Senators posted on Facebook about the resolution and told students to email A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez by the deadline if they needed transportation funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Márquez forwarded the students’ full names and student identification numbers to the university’s Financial Crisis Response Team, which then decided how much money a student would be awarded for transportation on a case-by-case basis, Maalizadeh said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Out of the $5,000 that was allocated, $2,800 was used as of Dec. 14, according to Michael Miller, assistant vice chancellor for enrollment services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who responded by the 10:30 a.m. Thursday deadline were able to pick up checks at 3 p.m. from the BARC office, Miller said. Students who responded after that deadline but before 10:30 a.m. Friday can pick up their checks by 3 p.m. today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller said the amount of money given to students depended on their destination and was based off the cost of a Amtrak ticket. He explained that a student who needed to travel south to Los Angeles or San Diego was given approximately $40.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who needed to travel north to San Francisco or Sacramento were given approximately $100 for the fare, Miller said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 50 students received funding, according to Brooke Kopel, a college of letters and sciences senator and third-year political science major.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Thomas Fire has burned 252,500 acres and is 35 percent contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mandatory evacuations have occurred across Ventura and Santa Barbara counties and 972 structures have been destroyed.

Jimenez, a second-year undeclared major at UC Santa Barbara, settled on the idea for her interactive sculpture due to the recent impact of the movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez said in an email that the #MeToo Twitter hashtag recognizes how many people, mostly women, are sexually assaulted and “exposes the alarming numbers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez said the project has a great deal of personal significance to her because she is a survivor of sexual assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said she found it very difficult to acknowledge and speak of her experience, but that she regained a sense of hope and power after seeing the #MeToo movement trending on Twitter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When designing the project, Jimenez was initially worried that simply posting a large sign with the hashtag would be too obvious, but quickly noticed that many students were still unaware of the meaning behind the viral campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t want people to think that I was trying to turn a subject that’s so important and disgusting into just a pretty photo opp or something ‘aesthetic,’” she said in the email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez said she believed it would be powerful to see how many flowers stacked up on her art piece, representing how many people have been affected by sexual assault directly or indirectly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students choose to complete their projects off campus in Isla Vista, but Jimenez said for her that was not an option.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I insisted on my piece being on campus because that’s the main audience I wanted to view my piece: my own peers,” Jimenez wrote in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:

difficulty of getting permission from the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez decided not to submit a request to display her piece on the Storke Tower

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Jimenez could be creative with the idea and creation of the project, she said she is grateful for the input and help she received along the way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the project would not have been possible without the support of three people: her professor, her aunt who owns a Carpinteria flower shop and UCSB woodshop technician Michael Matheson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez said she has mostly received positive responses to her piece, yet some people are still unaware of the topic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that students have also responded positively on social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All positive responses so

mental illness during the Feb. 2 meeting. <em>Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate held a Housing Ad-Hoc Committee on Feb. 2 in response to the resolution passed on Jan. 24 in support of mentally disabled students in on-campus housing.</p>\n<p>The meeting was held by Senators Alison Sir and Anthony Pimentel and concluded with a plan to continue the discussion with university administrators and Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.)</p>\n<p>Sir read off an anonymous testimony from a student who removed from university housing due to a mental disability.</p>\n<p>“When I met with Housing and Judicial Affairs, they said I was banned because I violated the Personal Care Clause and my agreement, even though it was due to my mental illness,” Sir read from the testimony.</p>\n<p>The meeting began with a public forum to allow students of the UC Santa Barbara community to voice their concerns.</p>\n<p>“I know a lot of people who have had to go to Tropicana because of this clause and I’m here to say that as a personal representative of the RHA Coordinating Board, I’m just here to support you guys,” said Kevin Sabellico, San Rafael Hall Council Co-President.</p>\n<p>Daniel Renteria, Chair of the Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU), added that he needs to “make sure this is an appropriate goal for IVTU to be a part of.”</p>\n<p>In the approved plan of action, senators will split into three groups to collect information regarding the “Personal Care Clause” to present at a Town Hall meeting with the UCSB community in two weeks, according to Pimentel.</p>\n<p>Three senators will meet with Housing and Residential Services, a second group will meet with C.A.P.S., and a third group will meet with Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80789\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80789\"

Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p>“Is it a mental disability, is it depression, is it you leaving your clothes on the floor and it smelling after two weeks… does that count as personal care?” Pimentel said, referencing to the vague justifications used to remove students from Housing.</p>\n<p>During their meeting with C.A.P.S., the senators plan to discuss the training provided to Residential Life staff on handling mental health issues and C.A.P.S.’s role in helping students who may struggle with mental illness, according to Sir.</p>\n<p>The council also plans to gather and release testimonies from students who attend C.A.P.S. for review and potential policy changes.</p>\n<p>Sir clarified that their intentions are not to discourage students from using C.A.P.S., calling it a “great student resource” that simply needs improvement.</p>\n<p>Pimentel said Senators speaking with administration plan to gather information on UCSB’s involvement in dealing with these issues.</p>\n<p>“I felt like it was a very productive and efficient meeting that allowed Alison and myself to hear the public’s thoughts and perspectives about this issue and allowed us to direct the Committee members onto the plan of action to combat the poorly written Personal Care clause,” Pimentel said.</p>\n<p>Pimentel encourages all students to attend the future Town Hall meeting. The location and date of the next Town Hall meeting has yet to be determined.</p>\n<p>Future meetings will be held with voting senators to maintain student anonymity.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Sabellico is the San Rafael Hall Council Co-President, not the President. </em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Sabellico said “clause”, not “cause.”</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80798\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-04/a-s-senate-creates-plan-to-action-at-disability-equality-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80798\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-04/a-s-senate-creates-plan-to-action-at-disability-equality-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-04/a-s-senate-creates-plan-to-action-at-disability-equality-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-04/a-s-senate-creates-plan-to-action-at-disability-equality-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-04/a-s-senate-creates-plan-to-action-at-disability-equality-meeting/","id":2345,"author":{"id":207,"name":"Jasmine Moreno"},"related":[2344,2343,2342],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
