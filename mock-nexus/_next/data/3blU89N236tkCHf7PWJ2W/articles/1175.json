Jacqueline Hinojosa then bunted down the third base line, reaching first on an error by the first year infielder Nicole Lopez. Stacy Cavazos came though again with a shot to the left-center warning track, where first year center fielder Sarah Muzik ran into the wall trying to catch the ball.</p>\n<p>After Jessica Johnston reached on a fielders choice with Tetzlaff being thrown out at home, Melanie Menor beat out a ranging throw from the shortstop Ojala to score Hinojosa from third.</p>\n<p>In the next at-bat, a fly ball off the bat of Arianna Palomares was dropped by left fielder Ulu Matagiese, allowing both Jessica Johnston and Stacy Cavazos to score making the score 8-4.</p>\n<p>Senior catcher Samantha Stark walked to bring up junior Emily Brucelas, who drove one up the middle to score Melanie Menor and what would be her team’s final run.</p>\n<p>Hawai’i scored on a wild pitch the next inning, but no rally was in store as the Gauchos won the first Saturday contest 9-5, the win going to pitcher Ashley Wright.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos did not fair as well in the second leg of the double header, losing 4-1 as sophomore pitcher Brittany Hitchcock went the full seven innings, allowing only six hits, one unearned run, and no walks to go along with four strikeouts.</p>\n<p>A masterful performance, Hitchcock made up for a rough outing on Friday by hitting all her spots while in the circle.</p>\n<p>For UCSB, first-year pitcher Veronica Gulvin was passable, allowing three runs in four and a third innings before being replaced by Ashley Ludlow, who closed the game in more concise fashion than her shaky start in the previous game.</p>\n<p>Four runs were plenty for the Rainbow Wahine, however, as sophomore catcher Rachel Lack’s two run homer in the third inning proved to be enough for the victory on its own putting them up 2-0. Lack would also drive in first-year left fielder Jennifer Iseri on a fifth inning single making the score 3-0.</p>\n<p>A late rally in the sixth gave the Gauchos a glimmer of hope, as senior Arianna Palomares started the action with a blooper to right field, just past the outstretched arm of Tayana Mata at second base.</p>\n<p>With Stark on second and Brucelas on first, Altmeyer rocketed one to center field, scoring Stark which made the score 3-1 in favor of the visiting team.</p>\n<p>The Friday 9-3 Gaucho victory was decided in the bottom of the third frame,</p>\n<p>where with two outs and Jessica Tetzlaff on second, back to back doubles from Melanie Menor and Arianna Palomare gave UCSB a 3-1 advantage.</p>\n<p>After Sierra Altmeyer loaded the bases with a grounder into to left field, Jacqueline Hinojose singled up the middle to score Stark, making the score 5-1 Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Another three runs in the bottom of the sixth juxtaposed by Hawaii’s one run in the top of the inning gave UCSB a large cushion at 8-2 and let them coast to the solid win.</p>\n<p>Despite losing the final game of the series Saturday afternoon, the Gauchos were still in good spirits for their senior celebration.</p>\n<p>With parents, family members, and friends galore, the Gauchos honored both the Rainbow Wahine seniors, as well as five of their own: Ashley Ludlow, Jessica Tetzlaff, Alex Pingree, Arianna Palomares, and Samantha Stark.</p>\n<p>The weight of their accomplishments during four years at UCSB was staggering, especially when read aloud over the loudspeaker.</p>\n<p>“It was a fun ride,” said senior catcher Samantha Stark, looking back on her time at UCSB. She continued, “we ended it with a bang,” and in relation to the final two series on the road, she declared plainly, “we’ve got nothing to lose. We just want to keep fighting and take these series.”</p>\n<p>After the game, the head coach of the UCSB softball team had nothing but praises to share about the graduating seniors.</p>\n<p>“The seniors have stepped it up in the past couple of weeks.” Coach Galicinao said. “They’ve been great leaders, not only on the field, but just keeping everybody focused.”</p>\n<p>She continued, explaining, “it’s easier to stay engaged and compete when you’re one of the top two teams, but our team has been really consistent in their effort and in how they’ve been competing, and a lot of that has to do with senior leadership.”</p>\n<p>First-year Sierra Altmeyer noted that the younger players, including herself, “have become really close with the seniors,” and that they were, “just doing it for them.”</p>\n<p>The camaraderie was more obvious than ever for the UCSB softball team on Saturday, as a tight-knit group of players came together to win the final home series of the 2016 season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is a doubleheader against UC Davis Saturday, May 7 beginning at 1 p.m. with the second game starting at 3 p.m. at La Rue Field.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70582\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/gauchos-win-final-home-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70582\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/gauchos-win-final-home-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/gauchos-win-final-home-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/gauchos-win-final-home-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/gauchos-win-final-home-series/","id":1175,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[1174,1173,1172],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey","biography":"Not available","articles":[41,43,44,1175,1180,1181,1182,1185,1186,1211,1917,3309,3313,3319,3320,4184,4993,4995,4998,4999,5000,5001,5002,5003,5018,5019,5025,5363,5397,5398,5411,5413,5415,5416,5432,5433,5434,5435,5452],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Seek to Beat Rival Cal Poly to Maintain 7-Match Win Streak","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WomensTennis_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-11-17_3-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WomensTennis_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-11-17_3-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Rising within the Big West standings, the UCSB women's tennis team carries its seven-match win streak into the traditional Blue-Green rivalry.

UCSB has three players returning from last year’s win against Cal Poly: Natalie Da Silveira, Jaimee Gilbertson and Melissa Baker, who are all looking to have another great showing in this rivalry matchup.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly is currently seventh place in the conference with a record of 2-5. Despite the poor position of the Mustangs, it is no guarantee that this will be an easy victory for UCSB; Cal Poly has had the best month of the season in April with a record of 2-2.</p>\n<p>One positive: the Mustangs were victorious in their last game against UC Riverside last week, winning at a score of 4-3. In the match, Cal Poly was able to clinch the doubles point and the match victory overall, despite taking three consecutive singles matches late in the meet. The close victory came for the Mustangs after suffering a deflating 4-0 loss to the Long Beach State 49ers during which no Mustang won a match, singles or doubles.</p>\n<p>The solid performance against Riverside may not be too good of an indicator of level of play for UCSB, as Cal Poly has been unable to perform well against the other top teams in the conference such as Cal State Fullerton and Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>Coming off of a weekend during which the Gauchos beat those two exact teams, the comparison between UCSB and Cal Poly in this match clearly favors the Gauchos winning the meet again. However, the Mustangs may be motivated to play well, as this is the final regular season chance for bragging rights in the rivalry.</p>\n<p>Players who are currently on a hot streak for the Gauchos are Palina Dubavets, Natalie Da Silveira and Amanda Atanasson. These players have been playing exceptionally well in the month of April, as Dubavets won all of her matches, both singles and doubles, in her last two matches against top competition. Da Silveira won all of her singles matches and one of her doubles matches against the same opponents. Atanasson was able to come back in last weekend’s meet against Long Beach State after losing the doubles match to begin the day.</p>\n<p>In the case of Dubavets, she was recently awarded her second Big West Women’s Tennis Athlete of the Week after defeating Long Beach State’s Maeva Razakasoa — a two-time Big West Player of the Year — in singles last week, helping UCSB take the victory over LBSU 4-2.</p>\n<p>No win comes easy for any team, especially in a rivalry match like this one. The Blue-Green rivalry spans between all sports, and with all that’s on the line for the Gauchos, chances are they won’t be taking things easy come Saturday.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Cal Poly at 10 a.m. on Saturday, April 22 in Santa Barbara at the Rec Cen courts.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the April 20, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>The early preseason exhibition gave the Gauchos their first look at a new lineup that has five new players in the starting lineup and at least nine overall.</p>\n<p>It didn’t take long for them to get off the mark in the new year as in the 12th minute sophomore midfielder Ismaila Jome pushed the ball up the middle before delivering a gorgeous through ball on the right side to McKenna. The senior’s initial one-time shot was saved by Westmont’s junior goalkeeper Josh Glover, but the rebound fell right back to McKenna who scored an easy goal after regaining his balance.</p>\n<p>UCSB proceeded to dominate possession for the rest of the first half with the Warriors continually attempting to catch the Gauchos on the break with unsuccessful long balls. Jome and McKenna were the best players on the field as they continued to put pressure on the Westmont back four, sending in dangerous crosses on multiple occasions.</p>\n<p>After Jome won a corner in the 25th minute, McKenna put in a cross from the left corner flag that found a sky-high Murphy placing a header perfectly into the bottom right corner of the net. The goal gave UCSB a 2-0 lead that would remain intact until the final whistle, but the chances were not done.</p>\n<p>The second half told a different story from the Westmont perspective, as the Warriors tried to capitalize on several sloppy clearances and turnovers in play by UCSB defenders. However, sophomore goalkeeper Josh McNeely luckily didn’t need to record a single save on the night to preserve the shut out with Westmont attackers consistently missing the target on open looks.</p>\n<p>“I think [the second half] was good. The game opened up and we had a ton of opportunities,” McKenna said. “It could’ve turned into 3, 4, or 5 but you’re not always gonna score all your chances. I thought it was good that we were getting chances and it showed that we have a lot of firepower going forward.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos found themselves with more than one great chance to score, most notably on a breakaway in the 72nd minute when sophomore forward Armand Bagramyan had his one-on-one shot saved by the keeper. Bagramyan had a team-high five shots, as many as the entire Westmont team, as he led a bench mob that played for much of the second half.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re pretty far along,” McKenna said. “Obviously we have a group of 9 players coming in so it will take some time for them to get used to the college atmosphere and game but I think we’re ready to go down to South Carolina and perform well and win games.”</p>\n<p>Next weekend will see UCSB travel to South Carolina to play the College of Charleston at 4:30 p.m. on Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55979\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-24/gauchos-claim-victory-in-season-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55979\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-24/gauchos-claim-victory-in-season-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-24/gauchos-claim-victory-in-season-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-24/gauchos-claim-victory-in-season-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-24/gauchos-claim-victory-in-season-opener/","id":1173,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1172,1171,1170],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Top Seed at Stake: No. 42 UCSB Faces No. 44 Cal Poly in Reg.

They were previously No. 48 in the nation, but their dominance over UC Irvine and UC Riverside elevated them through those six spots. The star duo of Simon Freund and Morgan Mays recently dropped down to No. 29, previously No. 23, in doubles rankings after not playing together this past weekend. The Gauchos also currently stand at a .762 win percentage and will remain above the .700 mark no matter the result of this weekend’s meet.</p>\n<p>Recently, the Gauchos have found strength in their singles play consistency. Their doubles play, however, has averaged out as an even split throughout the month of April.</p>\n<p>As for Cal Poly, they currently stand at a 16-6 overall on the season following their pair of conference wins also against UC Irvine, 5-2, and UC Riverside, 6-1. The Mustangs are currently ranked No. 44 on the ITA standings, a one-spot improvement on their previous No. 45 overall rank. Beginning in early March, Cal Poly was on an eight-game win streak before falling to UC Davis, for its first conference loss on April 2. The Mustangs currently have one ranked doubles team of Corey Pang and Ben Donovan, who are No. 55 in the nation. Donovan is also No. 113 on the ITA singles play rankings.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly has been on a roll in doubles competition, as they have yet to lose a contest throughout the month of April. In terms of their most recent loss against UC Davis, the Mustangs weren’t able to find singles play consistency early on, thus earning themselves their only loss since March 5.</p>\n<p>The result of this final regular season and Big West Conference meet will decide the first and second-place standings in the league. Regardless, both the first and second-place seeds will receive a first-round bye in the Big West Conference Tournament. The winner of the fourth versus fifth-place match will then face off against the first-place seed, while the winner of the third versus sixth-place match will play against the second-place seed.</p>\n<p>This weekend’s matchup against Cal Poly will also act as UCSB’s senior day. There are currently only two seniors on the team; the Gauchos will be honoring Morgan Mays and Teague Hamilton.</p>\n<p>The Blue-Green rivalry of UCSB versus Cal Poly is set to occur this Saturday, April 22 at 2 p.m. at home in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the April 20, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77141\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/top-seed-at-stake-no-42-ucsb-faces-no-44-cal-poly-in-reg-season-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77141\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/top-seed-at-stake-no-42-ucsb-faces-no-44-cal-poly-in-reg-season-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/top-seed-at-stake-no-42-ucsb-faces-no-44-cal-poly-in-reg-season-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/top-seed-at-stake-no-42-ucsb-faces-no-44-cal-poly-in-reg-season-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/top-seed-at-stake-no-42-ucsb-faces-no-44-cal-poly-in-reg-season-finale/","id":1174,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1173,1172,1171],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
