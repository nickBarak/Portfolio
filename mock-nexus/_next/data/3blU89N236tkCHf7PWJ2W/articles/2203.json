It will serve as home to a lecture hall, 17 labs, faculty and administrative offices and a three-story open-air atrium.</p>\n<p>The IEE focuses on the creation of new technologies and methods of energy conservation and sustainability, according to the UCSB Housing, Dining and Auxiliary Enterprises website.</p>\n<p>Henley will be the largest hall at UCSB to date with an estimated at 49,000 gross square feet. It is now in the initial stages of development.</p>\n<p>It will be designed to reduce its water and energy usage, along with its emissions.</p>\n<p>“[Henley Hall] is an outgrowth of our high-priority need for lab and teaching space, and also a recognition of UC Santa Barbara’s leadership in cutting-edge research on energy efficiency,” Leslie Colasse, project manager for Henley Hall, said.</p>\n<p>Henley is designed to maximize space and minimize the carbon footprint the building creates, according to the UCSB Design, Facilities and Safety Services website.</p>\n<p>The building will be composed of mostly steel and concrete with terracotta roof paneling and spires to promote natural shade and cooling.</p>\n<p>Henley is entirely donor funded, with a $56 million budget provided by the Henleys and various other anonymous donors.</p>\n<p>The idea for the new hall came about due to growing class size, restrictive lecture hall capacity and the Institute’s growing impact on the UCSB campus, according to Associated Students (A.S.) President Brooke Kopel.</p>\n<p>“I think it is pretty apparent on campus that there is a shortage of classroom space. The amount of resources UCSB is given, there is still students sitting on the floor… Students [are] taking midterms on floors and that just entirely unacceptable,” Kopel said.</p>\n<p>News of Henley first reached the A.S. Main Office after complaints came in about blocked off bike paths around Campbell Hall, she added.</p>\n<p>Henley Hall and the IEE will be the Henleys’s largest gift to UCSB. The Henleys have been involved with the UCSB campus since the early 2000s.</p>\n<p>“Because I spent the majority of my career in the technology industry, my wife and I have been drawn to the terrific STEM programs… at UC Santa Barbara which have achieved national prominence over the decades,” Jeff Henley said in an email.</p>\n<p>“We realized that more and more laboratory space will be critical to attracting and retaining the best faculty as well as the best students for STEM, so this is primarily why we decided to support [Henley Hall].”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84664\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/new-ucsb-building-in-construction-arriving-in-2020/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84664\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/new-ucsb-building-in-construction-arriving-in-2020/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/new-ucsb-building-in-construction-arriving-in-2020/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/new-ucsb-building-in-construction-arriving-in-2020/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/new-ucsb-building-in-construction-arriving-in-2020/","id":2203,"author":{"id":230,"name":"Shelby Guy"},"related":[2202,2201,2200],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":230,"name":"Shelby Guy","biography":"Not available","articles":[2203,3696,3992,6503,7919,7947],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Judicial Council Seats Will Be Unfilled Until At Least Week 9","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-11-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3217.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Kopel estimates she will present her nominations to the Associated Students (A.S.)

id=\"caption-attachment-84595\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">AFSCME workers went on strike from Oct. 23 to Oct. 25. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The October strikes saw thousands of participants statewide, according to a press release sent out by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299 spokesperson, John de los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Protestors were joined by students, faculty and members of supporting unions.</p>\n<p>Several politicians, including California State Assembly Member Monique Limón, also came to speak in solidarity.</p>\n<p>“We’re here today because UC has not been able to negotiate a fair contract,” Babe Gonzalez, a medical assistant at UCSB Student Health, said.</p>\n<p>Gonzalez said workers have no protection against emergency layoffs in their contracts, which Gonzales believes is a bigger issue than wage increases.</p>\n<p>“What good is a raise today if they’re not going to guarantee that we would have no emergency layoffs, [that] they won’t be outsourcing our jobs and our job security? You can give us a raise today, and if that’s not in our contract, you can fire us tomorrow,” Gonzalez said.</p>\n<p>The workers who went on strike also expressed concern for their wages in relation to the high cost of living in the Santa Barbara area.</p>\n<p>Francisco Garcias, a facilities department worker who has been with UC for 22 years, said the cost of living is a huge issue UC workers face.</p>\n<p>“People have to drive an hour away from their jobs at the university to be able to make rent, to have a home … Our pay does not cover cost of living,” Garcias said.</p>\n<p>University of California Office of the President (UCOP) sent a statement to the Nexus on Wednesday that countered AFSCME demands for increased pay.</p>\n<p>“AFSCME patient care and service workers are already compensated at or above market rates, along with affordable health insurance and generous retirement benefits,” Danielle Smith, UCOP media communications specialist, said in an email.</p>\n<p>“An 8 percent pay increase for each of four years is not possible for taxpayer-supported institutions. The union wants more money – more than any other group at the university. This is why they are striking, plain and simple. AFSCME leaders have done little to truly help their union members.”</p>\n<p>The statement also said AFSCME leaders are hypocritical because AFSCME increased its membership fees in January, raising the monthly dues from $78 to $120.</p>\n<p>“AFSCME leadership has no qualms pointing a finger at UC while choosing to take a larger portion of their members’ paychecks.”</p>\n<p>A Supreme Court decision made in June of this year, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-1466_2b3j.pdf\"><em>Janus</em> v. <em>AFSCME</em></a><em>,</em> made membership dues for California public employee unions optional. The decision barred union collection of fair share fees, meaning that the union’s members are paying voluntarily.</p>\n<p>Additionally, UCOP said AFSCME leaders are “spreading false information” about employee displacement.</p>\n<p>Over the past five years, the number of patient care employees has increased by 18.9 percent and service workers by 14.4 percent, which is “consistent” with the growth of all union workers by 9.9 percent, Smith said in the UCOP statement.</p>\n<p>“UC hopes AFSCME leaders, given their wasted efforts, will now engage in productive, sensible negotiations, rather than blindly declare victory for a demonstration that moved them no closer to a better deal.”</p>\n<p>Students are also oftentimes confused about whether raising workers’ wages would affect tuition costs, according to Melissa Perez, an on-campus senator for Associated Students (A.S.)</p>\n<p>“I think one of the most common misconceptions about this strike, or why students oppose it, is that they believe that if the workers’ wages go up our tuition has to go up as well,” Perez said.</p>\n<p>“Realistically, the funding to pay for workers’ wages comes from the state’s budget, and our tuition is determined by the Board of Regents. They stand with us when we lobby and strike against tuition hikes, and so we have to stand with them when they’re trying to get a living wage.”</p>\n<p>While the strike did not result in resolved demands, it brought attention to the issues that UC workers face, lead groundskeeper Juan Donato said.</p>\n<p>“The purpose is to voice our concerns and that’s why we [strike],” Donato said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84594\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-28/afscme-strikes-come-to-an-end-ucop-states-afscme-strikes-were-wasted-efforts/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84594\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-28/afscme-strikes-come-to-an-end-ucop-states-afscme-strikes-were-wasted-efforts/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-28/afscme-strikes-come-to-an-end-ucop-states-afscme-strikes-were-wasted-efforts/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-28/afscme-strikes-come-to-an-end-ucop-states-afscme-strikes-were-wasted-efforts/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-28/afscme-strikes-come-to-an-end-ucop-states-afscme-strikes-were-wasted-efforts/","id":2200,"author":{"id":62,"name":"Emily Komessar"},"related":[2199,2198,2197],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
