As one Walter Hartwell White might phrase it, Pete Carroll is in the empire business.</p>\n<p>After perhaps the most dominant Super Bowl performance in history, a feat he accomplished with one of the youngest and most salary-cap friendly teams in the league, Carroll sits at the helm of a budding dynasty.</p>\n<p>This isn’t new territory either. Carroll won back-to-back championships with the University of Southern California in 2003 and 2004, won six BCS bowl games in nine years and finished in the top four of the Associated Press Poll in seven consecutive seasons. Before the reign of the SEC in college football, Carroll’s Trojans were the dominant program in the entire nation.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But the word on Carroll in previous years was that he was a college coach, and a college coach only. Before he went to Southern California, Carroll had unsuccessful tenures with the New York Jets and New England Patriots. A late season slide resulted in a 6-10 record with the Jets in 1994, leading to his firing after one season.</p>\n<p>Because of his success as a defensive backs coach and a defensive coordinator, he was given the chance to follow Bill Parcells in New England. The Patriots made the playoffs in Carroll’s first two seasons, but Carroll was again fired after a late season slide in 1999.</p>\n<p>Carroll had gained a reputation as a lame duck NFL head coach, but created a new legacy as an all-world recruiter and young spirit with his time at USC. He is the epitome of a player’s coach, and it translated to success in the NFL with this young Seahawks team. It’s not every day where a 62-year-old head coach connects with his players as equals, participating in full-contact drills one day and leading meditative yoga sessions the next.</p>\n<p>Carroll encourages his players to be themselves, on-and-off the field, which is part of the reason the attitude and sometimes overzealous confidence of the Legion of Boom is tolerated by fans in Seattle. Also, a Super Bowl ring helps.</p>\n<p>After becoming only the third coach in history to win a Super Bowl and a National Championship, Pete Carroll has established himself as one of the all-time greats, not just in college football. He is far and away the best football coach in the western United States (all due respect to Jim Harbaugh, but Pete has the hardware), and deserves to be included with names like Bill Belichick and Nick Saban in the conversation of best coach in America.</p>\n<p>There is also the strong possibility that we might be witnessing the next NFL dynasty evolving before our very eyes. Seattle has a 25-year-old franchise quarterback who has had more winning success in his first two years than any player in history, lethal weapons on offense in Marshawn Lynch and Percy Harvin, the best secondary in the last 20 years with all three of their all-world players returning, salary cap flexibility once they get rid of some overpriced inessential players and the best home-field advantage outside of Kansas City.</p>\n<p>A winning culture has been restored in Seattle, and Pete Carroll is leading the way. He was voted most popular coach in the league by players, and with his emphasis on relentless competition, no matter the situation, the loaded NFC can count on the road to the Super Bowl going through the 12th man.</p>\n<p>One would think Carroll has earned some rest and relaxation after such an epic journey. He’s having none of that though. The Seahawks victory parade is scheduled for Wednesday. Meetings to begin the 2014 season occurred yesterday. A champion’s work is never done. Always compete.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of Feb. 5th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53864\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53864\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies/","id":2058,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[2057,2056,2055],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco","biography":"Not available","articles":[597,2058,2084,2086,3196,3224,3228,3235,3239,3240,3242,3245,3250,3251,5105,5107,5108],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Senate Votes To Open Applications for CCS & On-Campus Senatorial Vacancies","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-06-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/70th-Senate_Andrea-Verdugo_ONLINE-14.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/70th-Senate_Andrea-Verdugo_ONLINE-14.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This is the second year in a row that no one has run for the open CCS seat.

About 92% of the building’s total space will be devoted to classrooms and lecture halls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Finance and Capital Strategies Committee is comprised of UC Regents as well as other advisory members, including Governor Gavin Newsom, UC President Janet Napolitano and chancellors from some of the UC campuses. They approved UCSB’s new building </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> along with new building projects at the Riverside, Berkeley and San Diego campuses </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on May 16 at the UC Regents meeting at UC San Francisco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These new building projects are part of <a href=\"https://www.facilities.ucsb.edu/departments/campus-planning-design/2010-long-range-development-plan-lrdp\">UC’s Long Range Development Plan (LRDP)</a>; the plan was implemented by the Regents in 2010, with the purpose of “shap[ing] how the campus will develop to the year 2025, including changes in our academic programs and the development of additional campus housing for students, faculty, and staff,” according to UCSB’s Design, Facilities, and Safety Services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, UCSB’s new Classroom Building will cost $97,133,000; 82% of funding is from state appropriations of $79,787,000, while 18% is from campus funds, which are non-state, non-tuition reserves from grants, investments and sponsored contracts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A portion of state appropriations will also come from state funding previously allocated for the Campbell Hall Replacement Building. Originally, the funding was allocated to tear down and replace Campbell Hall; however, concerns of the project’s financial feasibility, combined with immediate safety concerns, led UCSB to implement critical life-safety improvements and repairs in order to ensure safe, ongoing use of Campbell Hall, according to the proposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal states the new building will also alleviate problems of over-enrollment which have contributed to lower four-year graduation rates. UCSB’s registrar cited “lack of classrooms and inappropriately sized classrooms as the primary cause of … increasing student waitlists that tend to affect the four-year graduation rate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new Classroom Building will accommodate more than “twice the capacity and many more rooms than the previous Campbell Hall plans,” according to the proposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other alternatives to the Classroom Building discussed in the proposal include leasing off-campus space or annexing existing academic and administrative building space, but these ideas were not deemed viable by the committee because all other existing facilities on campus are already fully occupied, and “logistical problems” prevented leasing buildings in Isla Vista for classroom use.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88801\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88801\" data-attachment-id=\"88801\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/regents-approve-new-classroom-building-to-alleviate-over-enrollment/screen-shot-2019-05-29-at-3-32-34-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?fit=1200%2C772&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,772\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-29 at 3.32.34 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?fit=250%2C161&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?fit=888%2C571&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-88801 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?resize=888%2C571\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"571\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?resize=250%2C161&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?resize=768%2C494&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?resize=1024%2C659&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88801\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Proposed design for the new Classroom Building, located between the Psychology building and Davidson Library. <em>Courtesy of UC Regents</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to substantially increasing the amount of classroom space on campus, the Classroom Building will also incorporate more modern classroom designs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current classrooms are “exclusively traditional in format … lack[ing] the flexibility, amenities, and technology needed to accommodate contemporary, project-based learning,” according to the proposal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three active learning classrooms in the Classroom Building are designed for project-based teaching and group and student participation, with flexibility to arrange furniture and digital and visual technology for each class’s specific needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional discussion classrooms will include moveable furnishings and digital capability for project-based work, and lecture halls will be designed with rotating seats, allowing “turn-to-team” interaction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Classroom Building plan also requires the demolishing of Building 408, which holds the </span>McCauley Lab in EEMB (Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology) and the Passow Lab in MSI (Marine Science Institute), along with various graduate and faculty offices.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campus bike path runs through the future construction site for the Classroom Building;

The fee needed approval from 60% of voters in order to pass — or so A.S. Elections Board thought. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Elections Board Chair John Paul Renteria, Elections Board noticed a “discrepancy” between the A.S. Constitution and the Elections Code following elections night.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the AS 2018-2019 Constitution, it states that new fees put onto the ballot through a vote of senate need at least ⅔ of the votes to pass,” Renteria said in an email. “In Elections Code, it states that new fees put onto the ballot through the vote of the senate need 60%.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the Constitution is the superior law within A.S., the 64.93% of “yes” votes that SIRRC received was not enough — SIRRC needed two-thirds of the vote, according to Renteria. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SIRRC could not be reached for comment.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This discrepancy between the A.S. Constitution and the Elections Code has not always existed, however. Students voted to make the 60% to two-thirds, or 66%, change to the A.S. Constitution in 2017, according to Renteria. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time, Renteria said, the percentage change was made to the A.S. Constitution but not to Elections Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, if a new fee is put on the ballot by a vote of the A.S. Senate, two-thirds of the vote is needed for the adoption of the fee. Since the SIRRC fee was put on the ballot by a Senate vote, and not by a petition, this two-thirds requirement applies to the SIRRC fee. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the Constitution change was in 2017 and no new fees were put on the 2018 Spring Quarter Elections ballot, Elections Board did not discover this discrepancy until after the 2019 Spring Quarter elections, Renteria said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The discrepancy was brought to A.S. Senate’s attention during last week’s Senate meeting, since the 2019 Spring Quarter A.S. Elections results were on the agenda. However, Senate was unable to ratify the results, since not enough senators showed up to the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During public forum on May 8, Renteria informed A.S. Senate that the SIRRC fee did not pass.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The senators were then given the opportunity to ask clarifying questions, and by the end, a few senators said they agreed with Elections Board’s right to interpret the election results the way they did. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Rafael Cornejo said that if SIRRC had an issue with interpretation, SIRRC could file a complaint with Judicial Council. On-Campus Senator Yash Nagpal cited A.S. Legal Code, which states that Elections Board has jurisdiction over all election rules and policies and has the power to interpret the Elections Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Attorney General Zeina Safadi addressed the discrepancy during A.S. Senate’s public forum as well; however, she had differing views from Elections Board. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Parts of legal code says you need 60%, and then other parts of legal code say you need 66%, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">so, what you guys need to decide amongst yourselves is … whether or not you’re going to go with the 60% or 66%, and each part of legal code says something different about that,” Safadi said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My suggestion for you guys is to open a special election … You do have the ability to either affirm it or ratify or do whatever you want with it, regardless of what the student vote was.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Renteria indicated that only Elections Board could interpret the results and that the interpretation is not up for debate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked whether Elections Board has the final say in interpreting elections results, Safadi said in a message that “Elections Board has a say on how elections code is interpreted in relation to that fee, as does the attorney general’s office on how to interpret legal code.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ultimately, it is Senate who possesses the most power in determining the course of action following all the information presented to them (i.e. do they want to have a special election for that fee?),” Safadi added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safadi said during public forum that since new fees usually fail, there is no precedent for this exact situation. Safadi did acknowledge that the A.S. Constitution is the superior law. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Wednesday night’s meeting, A.S. Senate ratified the official election results, which say the fee needed two-thirds of the vote and therefore failed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ratification was initially objected to by Off-Campus Senator Jasmine Palmerin, who believed that the uncertainty around the SIRRC fee could lead to a Judicial Council case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nonetheless, the results were ratified with 11 senators in favor and three against. Six senators abstained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate’s approval of the results is seemingly a nod in agreement to Elections Board’s right to interpret the results of the election.  </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.
