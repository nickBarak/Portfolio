According to Mitchell, she never once asked them to describe their sexual assault experience out of respect for the witnesses.</p>\n<p>“Okay, what if that was me and I’m sitting there in the movie theater super overwhelmed and the whole world is watching the worst thing that ever happened to me … I wouldn’t want that,” Mitchell said. “The first question I ask them is, ‘why did you decide to

Outreach and Publicity Coordinator Devin Sercu said the case is a pivotal point in history and UC Santa Barbara students could benefit from learning about the case, which she believes has roots in sociology, psychology and communication.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t really something that maybe a lot of people know about,” Sercu said. “I know that I didn’t know too much about this before we started

times before she finally reached South Korea after serving seven years in the North Korean People’s Army.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara’s Liberty in North Korea (L.I.N.K.) chapter hosted the two North Korean defectors this Thursday to talk about human rights violations and their journeys in escaping a dictatorship.</p>\n<p>L.I.N.K. brought the defectors to campus through its partnership with Young North Korea, a South Korean nonprofit organization that focuses on awareness of North Korean human rights.</p>\n<p>According to Athena Wan, the club’s co-president and a third-year economics and accounting major, the UCSB L.I.N.K. chapter is dedicated to funding escape missions, helping North Korean refugees integrate into the world and creating a community around human rights activism.</p>\n<p>Kim said he was part of the <i>kochebi</i>, a group of orphaned children of the “hostile” or lower class. The children would scavenge and beg for food in the streets after the economic turmoil that resulted from the death of President Kim Il-Sung in 1994.</p>\n<p>According to Kim, the lower class in North Korea is constantly under surveillance. Citizens who associate with any religion, make contact outside of the country or show dissent toward the government are criminalized and discriminated against.</p>\n<p>The second defector was a part of the “core” or elite class due to her father’s position as a battalion commander, but her whole family was placed in the hostile class after her mother’s escape to China.</p>\n<p>After her second escape attempt, she was captured but released after promising the government that she would spy on her neighbors and friends. She was imprisoned and released again after her third attempt, but was frustrated with the political structure and finally escaped to South Korea.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76763\" style=\"width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76763\" data-attachment-id=\"76763\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-09/north-korean-defectors-share-stories-at-ucsb/img_9093/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?fit=960%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_9093\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76763\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76763\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Elizabeth Hong</em></p></div>\n<p>Yang Mo, Young North Korea’s College Student Alliance external affairs representative, said he works with other organizations throughout South Korea to facilitate the integration of defectors into education and the workforce.</p>\n<p>Both defectors are now students at universities in South Korea. Kim said his dream is to become a youth counselor, and the second defector hopes to finish her master’s degree in public administration and eventually receive a Ph.D. in the United States.</p>\n<p>She said North Korean people have no reason to “remain loyal to the supreme leader,” and she believes South Korea has a right to build defenses against North Korea.</p>\n<p>The United States recently helped South Korea set up a missile defense system referred to as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD).</p>\n<p>According to Al Jazeera, the deployment announcement was made on Mar. 7, a day after North Korea test-launched four ballistic missiles into the sea near Japan.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth Hong, third-year economics and accounting major and co-president of L.I.N.K., said the North Korean crisis deserves attention and urgency. She said she believes North Korea is often only associated with the politics of the regime or the Kim dynasty and many global citizens forget about the diverse North Korean people.</p>\n<p>“As students at a top-tier research institution, we should use our four years here to take initiative and gain a more global perspective,” Hong said. “Re-education is a top priority, and at L.I.N.K., we focus on people over politics.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76759\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-09/north-korean-defectors-share-stories-at-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76759\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-09/north-korean-defectors-share-stories-at-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-09/north-korean-defectors-share-stories-at-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-09/north-korean-defectors-share-stories-at-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-09/north-korean-defectors-share-stories-at-ucsb/","id":2399,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2398,2397,2396],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
