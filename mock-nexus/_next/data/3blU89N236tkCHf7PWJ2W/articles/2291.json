The next closest is senior outside hitter Charlene DeHoog with 139. Additionally, Heenan is third on the team with 16 assists.</p>\n<p>“Kelly just has this cool confidence to her when she plays,” senior setter Dana Vargas said. “What makes her so special is that she doesn’t make a lot of mistakes. Coach says she has a good volleyball I.Q.”</p>\n<p>From the first time she set foot on campus, Heenan has felt right at home in Santa Barbara – on and off the court.</p>\n<p>“I love it here,” Heenan said. “Everyone on the team has been really great and it’s been awesome to make an immediate impact.”</p>\n<p>Success is nothing new for the 5’8” defensive specialist from Costa Mesa. Heenan’s list of high school accolades is not a short one; as a senior at Newport Harbor High School she led her team to a state championship while receiving First team All-Orange County honors and was named a Top-250 preseason All-American.</p>\n<p>“I know how much hard work needs to be put in to be the best,” Heenan said. “The work ethic on this team is unbelievable.”</p>\n<p>Freshman outside hitter Kara Sherrard has a bit of a different story of her road to the starting outside hitter position. Asked to walk onto the team last year, Sherrard’s chances of starting were bleak.</p>\n<p>“Kara was obviously someone I wanted on the team, but [I] did not expect her to start for us,” Gregory said. “Over summer, she started to get stronger and stronger and to really commit herself to improving.”</p>\n<p>In Santa Barbara’s first match of the season on the road against UC Berkeley, sophomore outside hitter Leah Sully tore her ACL, leaving Sherrard as her replacement.</p>\n<p>“It’s always extremely unfortunate when a player is injured, but sometimes when one door closes, another one opens,” Gregory said. “Kara has been great for us.”</p>\n<p>The freshman entered her game and made an immediate impact, blocking a kill attempt on her first play.</p>\n<p>“It’s been unbelievable,” Sherrard said. “I just wanted to come in and play consistently for the team.”</p>\n<p>The 6’0” outside hitter has started every match since then. She ranks 2nd on the team with 340 total attacks her 95 kills are good for 3rd. Sherrard is also 4th on the team with 11 assists and is tied for 3rd with seven service aces.</p>\n<p>“Kara has come in and really stepped up to the plate,” Vargas said. “Her role is to be steady and defend, and she has stepped up to the plate when her number has been called.”</p>\n<p>Sherrard’s toughness may be her most impressive attribute. In a tournament game at the USD Invitational against Minnesota, Sherrard suffered a sprained ankle. Carried off the court, it seemed as if she would not return. However, Gregory put her back into the game in the second half.</p>\n<p>“I really feel like part of the team,” Sherrard said. “It raises my confidence level knowing that Coach has that much confidence in me.”</p>\n<p>Hailing from Lancaster, Sherrard led Quartz Hill High School to consecutive undefeated Golden League seasons. As a senior, she was named the Golden League Player of the Year, and earned First team All-CIF Southern Section honors.</p>\n<p>“The biggest thing [about Heenan and Sherrard] is that they believe in themselves and they know our coaches believe in them,” Gregory said.</p>\n<p>The pair of freshman has been doing its best work as of late. In Santa Barbara’s last three games — all wins — both Hennan and Sherrard have been fantastic. In the Gauchos’ 3-2 win over SDSU at the USD Invitational, Heenan set a season-high with 26 digs.</p>\n<p>“My success is really a product of the team’s,” Heenan said. “It’s good to know that all of the players are out there to support one another and lift each other up.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos opened up league play emphatically at the end of August, posting two straight road wins over Cal State Northridge and UC Irvine, before beating Long Beach State to begin Big West play 3-0.</p>\n<p>As has been the case all season, both Heenan and Sherrard impressed. In Santa Barbara’s win over Northridge, Heenan collected a team-high 19 digs, while Sherrard delivered 11 kills to lead UCSB to the hard-fought victory, 3-2.</p>\n<p>Against Irvine, the story was the same. Heenan led Santa Barbara with 16 digs, while Sherrard collected a double-double with 11 kills and 13 digs to help the Gauchos shut out the Anteaters 3-0.</p>\n<p>In Santa Barbara’s comeback win over Long Beach State, Heenan recorded a team-high 21 digs, while Sherrard posted another double-double with 15 kills and 10 digs.</p>\n<p>“This season has been a little bit surreal so far,” Sherrard said. “I wasn’t expecting to be playing at all this season, so it’s awesome to be helping the team out at all.”</p>\n<p>In the team’s latest victory, the freshman duo stepped up for the Gauchos once again. Sherrard had 16 kills and 14 blocks and Heenan tied for a team-high with 14 digs to lead to Gauchos to victory over Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is now 10-8 overall and 4-1 in Big West league play. UCSB will take to the court next this weekend when it faces Pacific and UC Davis on the road. As vital members of the squad, both Heenan and Sherrard will have to perform if the Gauchos are to continue their early season success.</p>\n<p>“Both of these girls are fantastic players,” Gregory said. “They have been great for us and I only expect them to get better.”</p>\n<p>Heenan, Sherrard and the rest of the squad will face Big West foe Pacific in Stockton on Oct. 15 at 7 p.m.</p><div

students more aware of the services available to them. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Student advocate general (S.A.G.), a position within the Office of the Student Advocate (OSA), works to help students who “face charges from the University in housing, academic, social conduct, and public interest matters,” according to the OSA website.</p>\n<p>Ettleson, an independent candidate and third-year film and environmental studies major, currently works as the OSA chief of staff with the current S.A.G., Jack Tannenbaum.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus </em>endorses Ettleson with the expectation that she will continue her work in the office in a responsible manner, placing students’ rights at the forefront of the office’s work.</p>\n<p>Ettleson is running on a platform of “putting the job first,” as expressed during the S.A.G. <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-17/a-s-student-advocate-general-candidate-forum-martinez-vs-ettleson/\">forum</a> on Monday. She described the role of S.A.G. as “complex” due to the confidential nature of the cases the office handles, but said she would be as transparent as possible.</p>\n<p>If elected, Ettleson wants to improve the office’s outreach to make students more aware of the services available to them. Her first project would be focused on possibly creating a database organizing outcomes of previous cases, which would help with future cases, she said.</p>\n<p>Ettleson’s only opponent in the S.A.G. race, Grecia Martinez, advocates for improved outreach and communication with organizers to learn about students’ rights, rather than the current S.A.G.’s use of polling.</p>\n<p>Martinez’s platform offers a vision of inclusivity and outreach which Ettleson could benefit from adopting; however, Ettleson’s focus on impartiality is a critical point of the S.A.G. position, an issue from which candidates should not waver.</p>\n<p>The S.A.G.’s role as an impartial advocate for the rights of all students, regardless of diversity of opinion and background, is critical in defending the basic freedoms that students have as listed in the Student Bill of Rights in the A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the position of S.A.G. necessitates objectivity and the <em>Nexus </em>hopes that, if elected, Ettleson will perform to these standards.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 19 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82556\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/rose-ettleson-for-student-advocate-general/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82556\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/rose-ettleson-for-student-advocate-general/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/rose-ettleson-for-student-advocate-general/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/rose-ettleson-for-student-advocate-general/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/rose-ettleson-for-student-advocate-general/","id":2289,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2288,2287,2286],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nuglets of Wisdom: “Bitches Love That Surfer Vibe, Bra”","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“Dude.

Surfers hail from a broad variety of places and cultures. I have a lot of good things to say about most of the surfers I’ve met in my travels. Then again, I have a lot of bad things to say about a lot of the surfers I’ve met. And most of the latter group come from Southern California and Santa Barbara. The bros in particular.</p>\n<p>However, there is a rare breed of die-hard surfers I’ve met in Santa Barbara, who get things done under the radar, who don’t surf the beach in hopes of glamour, pussy and a beach bod.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you can spot them lurking in the back of a party around midnight, checking NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) before they allow themselves another drink. Sometimes you can hear them in the mornings around 5 a.m., rubbing sleep out of their eyes and wearily dragging their wetsuits and damp towels down I.V. alleys to their surfmobiles. Sometimes you have no idea they exist because they live as mountain men in Los Padres National Forest, well below your glitzed-out radar.  Probably the most noticeable giveaway of a salty sea-vet’s behind-the-scenes surf activities is when you overhear one noting the wind conditions late at night. Or when you’re at their secret spot and they’re threatening to drown your kook ass— you’ll also know then.</p>\n<p>These are the surfers who don’t immediately saunter up and brag about where they surfed or the waves they got that day — instead they are looking forward, always stretching toward more spots, more waves, better designs, increased stoke. What these elites pull from their sessions is the knowledge of the perfect combination of wind, tide, direction and light required to create the ultimate dawn sesh at T’s, ’Con, Lil’ ’Con and certain other areas up and down the coast.</p>\n<p>These aren’t the shaggy-haired blonde boys and girls sitting in front of you in lecture, sporting bright pink Electric shades, obscene blue trunks, sorority rush shirts and surfer-style trucker hats. Not the fools who stain their reps by going for broke all day. (“Hey bra did you see that epic set at Sands yesterday? I like totally busted a rodeo flip over the whole UCSB surf team.”)</p>\n<p>Instead, these are the people accustomed to the chain of maneuvers that settle you into the precarious overhang beneath a slabby tube. They see swell lumping in from the horizon and know precisely how to start the elevator drop down a watery cliff-face into exalted tubedome.</p>\n<p>Surfers thrive in every nook and urine-drenched alley of Isla Vista. They exist in abundance in the state, nation and most of the coastal world.</p>\n<p>The only problem with surf bro-ciety is that there are too many wannabee Jordys out there, but too few Gerry Lopezs. Everyone wants to throw the biggest air all the time — but guess what? — waves are made of water. Try staying in the water for a while before you get any grandiose ideas, big fella.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot to be said for the type of person who learns things the hard way — through patience, practice and persistence. And passion, I could add.</p>\n<p>As a side note, there is also that unique breed which owns a house in Montecito, dates 19-year-old models from UCSB and moonlights as a world-champion surfer. How does he do it? Is he human?</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus Surf Columnist Elliott Rosenfeld will drown your kook ass if you ever suggest that he’s getting laid again.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26911\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/nuglets-wisdom-bitches-love-surfer-vibe-bra/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26911\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/nuglets-wisdom-bitches-love-surfer-vibe-bra/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/nuglets-wisdom-bitches-love-surfer-vibe-bra/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/nuglets-wisdom-bitches-love-surfer-vibe-bra/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/nuglets-wisdom-bitches-love-surfer-vibe-bra/","id":2288,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[2287,2286,2285],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Speace of Mind: Musings on Derek Jeter","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I don’t want it to end, period, but more so, I don’t want it to end in the way I think it is going to. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I don’t want it to end, period, but more so, I don’t want it to end in the way I think it is going to. The question on everyone’s mind in this day and age is, “What have you done for me lately?” signaling a trend toward taking out the old and shipping in the people and things that are younger, faster and newer. Maybe it’s the hidden kleptomaniac in all of us, but we are obsessed with the glitz, the glamour and the overall shine of something new. This is why it might be all too easy for the Yanks to give the old boot to my man, Derek Jeter.</p>\n<p>There is an intense amount of pressure and tension produced by each and every one of those hostile fans who pour in from Yonkers all the way to the Bronx. Jeter can feel it, sense it, touch it; the feeling is palpable. They are quick to embrace and love when everything is going right for a guy, but are even quicker to leave that same guy out in the cold once he nosedives. New Yorkers are definitely not on the level of the average Philly fanatic, where every game determines their mood for the rest of the day, week or even month, mind you. However, they are swift in making judgments, and fall somewhere between the obnoxiously interested middle-American, high-school football fan and the on-and-off Warriors fan.  And being that NY’s pinstriped darlings won the World Series in 2009, fans are on red alert this year, expecting a duplicate performance.</p>\n<p>Duplicating a performance, especially in October, is where Jeter usually comes in. After the record year he enjoyed in 2009, with a .334 batting average, a .406 on-base percentage and a whopping .465 slugging percentage, he has dropped off considerably. Some cite his age; some, his mindset. Dazzling us with his perfect Crest Whitestrip smile and his bronzed, Adonis-like skin since the age of 21, he has found his way into my- or, I mean, our- hearts with his solid play and classy style.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>However, the Jeter we have all come to know, love and respect might be in hibernation mode —forever. His .270 batting average, .340 on-base percentage and .370 slugging percentage are all among the lowest he has logged since his first days in Yankee Stadium. However, with all this being said, I am a firm believer in the age-old adage, “It’s going to get worse before it gets better.” Derek (yes, I feel close enough to the man to call him that) is not just another player. Heck, he isn’t just another Yankee. He is THE Yankee. He is an old-school player in the new-school age, ready to seize a moment when it is ready to be taken. This is October, my friends, and he didn’t become Mr. October for sitting around the couch with the Dodgers, Angels and Pirates. This is his time, and he knows it.
