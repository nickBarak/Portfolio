They reset my U-Mail, and I tried to show them that I was still getting spam, but it seemed like they didn’t believe me. They were helpful in resetting but even then I’m still wondering how our security is so compromised,” she said.</p>\n<p>Horowitz explained that there is little the help desk can do when someone falls victim to a phishing attack.</p>\n<p>“If you respond to a phishy message, they’re going to send you more messages because they know you respond. The help desk can’t fully prevent when the student declared themselves to be a soft target,” he said.</p>\n<p>Horowitz said that there is no clear answer as to how scammers obtained U-Mail information since some technology is untraceable and there are limitations to detecting online activity.</p>\n<p>He said, however, that possibilities could include leaks through students’ distribution mailing lists or computer malware.</p>\n<p>“The best way to tell if an email is a phishing scam is that if it expresses any sort of urgency or threat,” Horowitz said. “If it’s too good to be true, or if it’s really urgent and threatens, be circumspect about it. Have a skeptical mind to recognize when you’re being fooled. Students need to look out all the time.”</p>\n<p>Shea Lovan, associate director of UCSB’s Enterprise Technology Services, said that while he does not have phishing-specific statistics, “Office 365 blocks an average of 2.7 million pieces of spam and just under 5,000 pieces of malware destined for U-Mail accounts every month.”</p>\n<p>Phone call scams claiming ransom have also been targeting students and citizens throughout Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>Large reports of phone calls involving IRS impersonators and virtual kidnapping instances are on the rise, according to a press release from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO).</p>\n<p>Virtual kidnapping scams involve contacting a family member and claiming to have kidnapped someone close to them before demanding ransom payment.</p>\n<p>“The best way to combat these calls is to educate the public,” SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover said.</p>\n<p>“Anytime we send information out about these phone scams, it appears that it scares off the scammers for a time before they flare back up again,” she added.</p>\n<p>To avoid falling victim for phone scams, Hoover advises to simply hang up the phone.</p>\n<p>“If anybody calls you claiming to be from any agency and asks you for financial information or mentions that you owe something, just hang up and call the agency to make sure that this person is legitimate,” she said.</p>\n<p>If students have been victims of phishing, they should visit <em>security.ucsb.edu</em> to report the issue.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 3 of the April 12, 2018

Azulejos, Mexico City. <em>Courtesy of Osiris Gómez</em></p></div>\n<p>In an interview with the Nexus, Gómez said he hopes the event will challenge traditional conference dynamics of “subject and observer.”</p>\n<p>Gómez said he hopes to break these boundaries by removing the limitations of a traditional conference by creating a bridge between western academia to alternative cultural knowledge.</p>\n<p>He said this can reshape the assumptions of oral indigenous traditions and the way literary scholars currently perceive collective knowledge and oral histories.</p>\n<p>According to Gómez, transcending traditional conference settings will connect western academia to the non-academic work that indigenous people do in everyday sacred practices.</p>\n<p>A year after sending out a “Call for Papers,” which invited indigenous and native scholars to submit literary work and art to be shared at the conference, Gómez hoped to catch the attention of community leaders, artists and activists from different universities both here and abroad.</p>\n<p>He now hopes the conference will explore how minority cultures are “revising their knowledges and epistemological sources through poetic art.”</p>\n<p>In 2016, Gómez conducted research in Mexico for a dissertation about native languages and the sociopolitical movements for their revival.</p>\n<p>After meditating on his research results, Gómez said he realized this was the start of conceptualizing this first indigenous writers conference.</p>\n<p>“Quiero crear conciencia,” Gómez said, meaning “I want to create consciousness.” Gomez hopes to create a “conscious dialogue” that places value in each authors’ respective native cultures and languages.</p>\n<p>The conference will also challenge the terminology surrounding indigenous cultures, including the word “indigenous” itself, when analyzed and studied within western academia.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to include people that live what we’re trying to understand here… We’re here to learn from everyone and to learn from experience,” Gómez said.</p>\n<p>According to the conference’s mission statement, Verbal Kaleidoscope will explore the resistance that “lies in the throats of these literary voices that proclaim cultural self-determination.”</p>\n<p>These literary voices “will echo a worldwide literary and social movement” that is fighting for the survival of indigenous territories and peoples.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

Post-treatment includes an assessment of the patient 7-14 days after the drug is taken, rather than a formal examination conducted by a physician, according to an article published by the <a href=\"http://www.pharmacytimes.com/contributor/sally-rafie-pharmd/2016/04/abortion-pill-label-change-what-pharmacists-need-to-know\">Pharmacy Times.</a></p>\n<p>The waiting period to take Misoprostol, the medication taken after Mireprex, changed from 72 hours to 24-48 hours.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The UCen renovation project will include an innovation lab, a demonstration kitchen, a Wellness Center and an A.S. Bike shop. The total cost of the project and sources of funding are still undetermined. Irene Chen / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“I think this project is transformational in its scope,” said Mark Nocciolo, director of capital development at UC Santa Barbara. Nocciolo has overseen early renovation plans and worked with the architect and Associated Students (A.S.) to help visualize the project.</p>\n<p>“The intent is to try to redefine the University Center to be less like a mall and more like a student union. Anybody who has been to any Division 1 campus would recognize that there’s usually a university center that’s more student-oriented than ours is,” he explained.</p>\n<p>The model was developed by Nocciolo and Jean Gaff, managing principal of Pfeiffer Architects.</p>\n<p>The plans radically change and “revitalize” the University Center (UCen) into a “NewCen,” according to A.S. President Hieu Le.</p>\n<p>“Today’s Student Affairs’ (S.A.) service needs substantially exceed the capacity of S.A. facilities, compromising functionality, collaborations and staff and student well-being,” Le said.</p>\n<p>The renovated UCen would include a new “innovation lab” where students could collaborate on projects, a “demonstration kitchen” in which chefs would offer cooking lessons and connectivity kiosks, in which students tabling for their organizations would have a space to set up shop.</p>\n<p>These features are in addition to elements previously described on the project’s ballot measure, such as expanded space for the A.S. Food Bank, Campus Learning and Assistive Services (CLAS) and Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.).</p>\n<p>The 3D model additionally projects an expanded Wellness Center, which currently exists inside Student Health. As <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/stagnant-2-million-fund-could-offset-ucen-project-costs-fees-will-still-rise-after-inflation/\">previously reported</a>, the building would also include a migrated A.S. Bike Shop.</p>\n<p>The project would also include a new “pedestrian zone” adjacent to the building, which would allow more space for people walking through on campus tours.</p>\n<p>Several areas of the current UCen, such as the bookstore, Starbucks and some of the food areas, will remain in business throughout construction, Le said.</p>\n<p>Since the project was first proposed, students have disputed how much it would <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/\">actually cost</a>, while information about the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/broken-outdated-pipes-to-blame-for-ucen-smell/\">state of the current UCen</a> and Le’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/petition/\">petitioning methods</a> have been controversial topics across the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>If students vote to pass the project, student fees will be increased $20.40 per quarter from Fall 2018 until Fall 2022. From Fall 2022 to Fall 2052, students will pay an additional $96.06 per quarter.</p>\n<p>Funding for the project will come from a combination of alumni donations, student fees and the university itself, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“At this current state we don’t know [exactly how much people will pay] because there are a lot of factors, such as donations,” he said.</p>\n<p>This is the third time an A.S. president has created a UCen renovation plan. During the 2013-14 school year, then-President Jonathan Abboud developed a similar plan that would have expanded space in the UCen to allocate more space to campus services. The plan failed on the spring ballot.</p>\n<p>Another failed UCen renovation, proposed in 2011, would have expanded third-floor study space. In 2012, then-President Harrison Weber created a plan for an entirely new building, a Student Engagement Center. Students voted down the fee initiative in the spring election.</p>\n<p>While the organization of different spaces has varied in the different UCen plans, the concept has remained fairly consistent, Nocciolo said.</p>\n<p>He noted that the latest renovation project differs from the previous ones because it addresses infrastructural problems that are reportedly plaguing the facility.</p>\n<p>Students will vote on this project in April 23-26. If it passes, planning likely will begin immediately, according to Le.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the April 12, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
