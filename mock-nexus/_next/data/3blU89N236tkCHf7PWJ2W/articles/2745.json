Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The MultiCultural Center (MCC) and English professor Felice Blake hosted a remembrance event on Tuesday in the MCC to create a healing space for students, staff and faculty affected by the events of May 23, 2014.</p>\n<p>Attendees discussed ways to combat racism and sexism in Isla Vista in context of the anniversary of the shooting. The event was facilitated by third-year film major Ashley Baker, who led group activities with Blake and encouraged participants to express their emotions and acknowledge words of healing such as “faith,” “hope” and “power,” as well as words that reflect wounds such as “fear,” “anger,” and “alone.” Blake focused on community building and different resources and systems of support for those who have gone through difficult experiences.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Even if we want to take up issues of race or sexuality, we realize that we don’t all experience these things in the same way.</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Blake, increasing police presence and surveillance as a response to the events of May 23 last year has exacerbated the pre-existing tensions between students of color and law enforcement, specifically issues of profiling and biased arrests.</p>\n<p>“Even while these students [of color] believe that safety is a pressing concern, we don’t automatically share the same ideas of safety and security and protection just because we happen to be affiliated with UCSB,” Blake said. “Even if we want to take up issues of race or sexuality, we realize that we don’t all experience these things in the same way.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Womyn’s Commission’s supporting chair and third-year comparative literature and global studies double major Cassie Rubio said administrators reacted to the events of May 23 last year incorrectly. According to Rubio, administrators increased policing while failing to address the roots of the problem, sexism and racism.</p>\n<p>“The increased militant police presence that we now have … is really harmful to communities of color, women, other marginalized groups who have histories with police presence,” Rubio said. “What has not changed is the administration’s failure and blatant erasure of misogyny and racism and serious issues that we need to deal with on our campus. We need more healing spaces that are more focused and informed of these issues.”</p>\n<p>Several attendees recounted their experiences entering the university last fall, expressing they expected an open and loving environment but were faced instead with sexism and racism. One attendee described UCSB’s environment as “disappointing” due to the prevalence of student-filed sexual assault cases.</p>\n<p>Participants used the space to discuss their individual emotions about the events of May 23 last year, describe memories and offer advice for those experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder and other lasting effects.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Response Network Operations team leader Anthony Rodriguez said students experiencing trauma should recognize there are others who care and many who feel the same way. According to Rodriguez, students have the ability to strengthen Isla Vista through unity.</p>\n<p>“Know that you are not alone, whatever you are feeling — no one can change that,” Rodriguez said. “But there’s so much to do to empower your community. I.V. is not alone. You guys have heart and that’s a good thing.”</p>\n<p>Director of the MCC Zaveeni Khan-Marcus said UCSB should increase representative conversations because, while the events of May 23 last year were shared experiences for the entire student body, they affect individuals differently.</p>\n<p>“[We discussed] the sense of isolation and loneliness that impedes us from creating a community and trying to help each other,” Khan-Marcus said. “Of course everyone came together during the tragedy but two years from now, one will not have a common thread. And then how do we love?”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Know that you are not alone, whatever you are feeling — no one can change that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Baker said she is pleased to see how rapidly the campus has grown in the past year.</p>\n<p>“Just seeing the campus grow from last year to this year has been pretty phenomenal,” Baker said. “Of course it’s still going to have its cold spaces. I just see how precious life is and I don’t want to waste a minute of it. Even if it’s scary, I try to push myself to do things I don’t normally do.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63621\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/event-discusses-combating-i-v-racism-sexism/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63621\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/event-discusses-combating-i-v-racism-sexism/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/event-discusses-combating-i-v-racism-sexism/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/event-discusses-combating-i-v-racism-sexism/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/event-discusses-combating-i-v-racism-sexism/","id":2745,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2744,2743,2742],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli","biography":"Not available","articles":[2332,2347,2356,2359,2380,2387,2428,2433,2440,2446,2452,2460,2463,2464,2468,2470,2474,2484,2497,2510,2521,2528,2555,2569,2573,2626,2627,2628,2642,2706,2745,2751,2753,2756,2766,2770,2806,2836,2975,2979,2987,2993,3451,3593,3596,3759,3762,3765,3899,3901,3909,3963,3965,3969,3986,4462,4464,4483,4505,4521,4623,4647,4699,4768],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Students Advocating for Fossil Fuel Divestment Stage Sit-in, Meet With Chancellor Yang","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-05-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_1138.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_1138.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After hosting a sit-in at Cheadle Hall for almost 36 hours, student leaders are currently meeting with Chancellor Henry T.

Posters and overnight bags cover the walls and floors of Cheadle Hall’s first-floor lobby.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 150 students protested Monday and almost 40 students stayed overnight, Fossil Free UCSB spokesperson Cassie Macy said. Organizers report that over 200 students have joined Tuesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang reportedly met with student leaders at approximately 3 a.m. Tuesday morning to arrange  a meeting later that day. Fossil Free UCSB coordinators Theo LeQuesne and Claire Wilson started their meeting with Yang at approximately 3 p.m. Tuesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fossil Free UCSB says the chancellor already “embraces the campaign,” according to a press release Monday, but organizers hope that Tuesday’s meeting will spur Yang to take a more active role.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope that, with his public acknowledgement of support for our campaign, that will have a rolling effect with other chancellors across the UC campuses so that they will also step up and commit to divesting away from fossil fuels,” Celeste Argueta, a Fossil Free UCSB spokesperson, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fossil fuel activists at UC Berkeley staged a similar sit-in just two weeks ago, during which over 20 students sat in Sproul Hall for almost 10 hours until UCPD asked them to leave.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Davis chapter of Fossil Free UC also hosted a sit-in last week on their campus. Student activists initially planned to demonstrate in Mrak Hall during business hours but opted instead to stay the night after being asked by administration to vacate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of the most successful sit-ins have divested from fossil fuels, so why can’t we?” Macy said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fossil Free UCSB organizers plan to remain in Cheadle Hall until Thursday. UC Regents will be holding one of their bimonthly meetings in Berkeley next week, during which they look to discuss the status of their investments.</span></p><div

felt they had a voice in these important issues and establish a mechanism for us to share information to the students about what is happening in this area,” UC Systemwide Title IX Coordinator Kathleen

href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/KP3WLYN\">Applications</a> are due on Thursday, Nov. 30 at 5 p.m., and the selected board members will receive news of their acceptance in January.</p>\n<p>Board members will serve for one year with the exception of board members chosen in January, who will serve a year and a half term.</p>\n<p>According to Associated Students (A.S.) President Hieu Le, he and other stakeholders worked with Salvaty and Title IX Program Coordinator Evelyn Cheng to create the board.</p>\n<p>He added that SAB members will be able to hold decision-makers accountable, as they will be involved in the “procedures, implementation and enforcement of both Title IX and the UC Policy on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence.”</p>\n<p>Le said he was involved in discussing the board’s duties and the qualifications for those who will serve. Board members must be heavily involved within their student communities and have expertise on issues relating to sexual harassment and sexual violence.</p>\n<p>The University of California Title IX Office, responsible for <a href=\"http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/4000385/SVSH\">UC Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment</a>, will seek critical feedback from the board.</p>\n<p>Board members are expected to provide information to their campuses regarding sexual violence and sexual harassment response and prevention efforts being made by the system-wide office.</p>\n<p>A panel of UC Santa Barbara administration members said the board members should be compensated at a town hall meeting that took place on Tuesday, Nov. 14, which focused on updates regarding the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nowUCsbDemands2.0May32017.pdf\">sexual assault demands</a> made by nowUCsb during their <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\">sit-in this May</a>.</p>\n<p>The panel agreed to deliver the message to the administration in charge of the SAB.</p>\n<p>“This is a volunteer board,” Salvaty emailed when asked whether she believed that the students on the board should be paid.</p>\n<p>“I am really looking forward to working with and learning from the student board members.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.7 of the Nov. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

all first-years were rerouted beginning Fall 2016.</p>\n<p>Courses are still offered for the old program, but students entering the department are pushed towards earning a more biology-based degree.</p>\n<p>Classes in chemistry and biology are now prerequisites for earning a Bachelor of Science degree in psychological and brain sciences, as well as biopsychology.</p>\n<p>The department allowed transfer students to declare the Bachelor of Arts in psychology for a year longer than other students due to the different prerequisites they had to compete at community college.</p>\n<p>UCSB is the first UC campus to only offer the Bachelor of Science degree.</p>\n<p>According to the psychology department chair Diane Mackie, modern psychology is more aligned with biology and other science, technology, engineering and math (S.T.E.M.) fields. The changes to the psychology degree are a “reflection” of how the discipline has developed in recent years, she said.</p>\n<p>“The change in degree is meant to benefit students, giving them a competitive edge in their further studies, careers and research,” Mackie said. “We wanted to create a new degree more biologically based and rooted in science.”</p>\n<p>The biology courses offered for the psychology department are different than the courses offered for the biology major, she said.</p>\n<p>Mackie said the old degree did not provide adequate training for modern psychology. The changes were not prompted by financial issues. The current psychology and brain sciences faculty are experts in the biological side of psychology, so the university won’t need to hire new professors.</p>\n<p>Some first-year students, however, are wary of the changes.</p>\n<p>Kellie Stahlhuth, a first-year undeclared major, said she planned to get a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology at UCSB and pursue a career in psychology after graduation, but is now unsure if the offered Bachelor of Science degree is the best way to achieve her goals.</p>\n<p>“The other UC campuses and most other universities in California still have a psychology B.A., in addition to the fact that it was a popular degree [at UCSB],” she said.</p>\n<p>However, Carly Wilcox, a fourth-year psychology major, said as she nears the end of her time at UCSB, she would have appreciated a Bachelor of Science degree to diversify her classes.</p>\n<p>“I would have liked the B.S. when I was an incoming freshman personally… but it might be nice if the department offered both,” Wilcox said. “I took Statistics and Math 34A, but other than that the classes for my major have been strictly psych classes.”</p>\n<p>When the old degree was still in effect, the department received approximately 300 applications per year from incoming freshmen seeking a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology.</p>\n<p>This past fall, there were approximately 200 freshman applicants to the new Bachelor of Science degree.</p>\n<p>Mackie recommends all psychology majors, even those who may not be as S.T.E.M.-oriented as others, to still pursue the Bachelor of Science degree because they will receive a more well-rounded psychology education.</p>\n<p>Mackie said students planning on pursuing a career in clinical psychology are given the education they need, while also benefiting students seeking work in medical and research fields.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 12, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79095\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsb-first-uc-to-remove-bachelor-of-arts-in-psychology/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79095\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsb-first-uc-to-remove-bachelor-of-arts-in-psychology/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsb-first-uc-to-remove-bachelor-of-arts-in-psychology/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsb-first-uc-to-remove-bachelor-of-arts-in-psychology/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsb-first-uc-to-remove-bachelor-of-arts-in-psychology/","id":2744,"author":{"id":177,"name":"Kayla Larson"},"related":[2743,2742,2741],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
