The goal had playoff implications, nearly knocking the Gauchos out of playoff contention.</p>\n<p>Initially, Christy did not plan on pressing charges, but decided the next day to go forward with charging McGlynn.</p>\n<p>“It’s not uncommon that people change their minds and he’s well within his right to do so,” Romero said.</p>\n<p>According to Gauchos head coach Tim Vom Steeg, Christy sustained no injuries as a result of the push.</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to speak for him, but I did walk over and I said, ‘Are you okay?’” Vom Steeg said. “And he said, ‘Yeah I’m okay.’”</p>\n<p>McGlynn faces a maximum punishment of a $2,000 fine and a year in county jail for the misdemeanor charge.</p>\n<p>McGlynn made a statement via Twitter Tuesday, apologizing for his actions.</p>\n<p>“I would just like to take this opportunity to express how deeply I regret the incident I was involved in on Sunday. My actions were completely my own and now I will accept the full consequences of the matter. Not only did I let myself and my family down, but also my team, the coaching staff, the athletic department, UCSB, the alumni, and everybody from the Santa Barbara community, and I would want to say to all involved of how very sorry I am.”</p>\n<p>Moving forward, the next step for McGlynn will be going to court, which should happen in the next couple weeks.</p>\n<p>“He’ll have to go to court to officially hear the charges against him and have him put a plea in of guilty or not guilty,” Romero said. “If he does decide to say he’s not guilty, then he will probably have to set up another court date with a hearing to see if there’s enough evidence to sustain a charge. If the court decides there is enough evidence, then they’ll set a trial date. Then again, all this could be handled outside the courtroom too. It’s all on how Mr. McGlynn answers to the charges.”</p>\n<p>According to Romero, a negotiation could be settled if McGlynn decides to plead guilty or no contest.</p>\n<p>“If he decided to plead guilty or no contest, there would have to be some type of negotiation between the district attorneys, and then probation and him deciding what type of punishment, if any, he would have to answer to,” Romero said.</p>\n<p>On Monday, USCB athletic director Mark Massari announced McGlynn’s removal from the team. He has also been completely removed from the UCSB website. In addition, Massari also announced UCSB would forego any postseason opportunity, although it turns out UCSB would not have made the playoffs regardless. Vom Steeg was also suspended from yesterday’s game at Sacramento State.</p>\n<p>“There’s a line,” Vom Steeg said after the game. “You can be upset and scream and yell and be frustrated. We all were, but nobody else on the team went [to McGlynn’s level].”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48539\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/mcglynn-charged-battery-misdemeanor/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48539\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/mcglynn-charged-battery-misdemeanor/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/mcglynn-charged-battery-misdemeanor/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/mcglynn-charged-battery-misdemeanor/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-01/mcglynn-charged-battery-misdemeanor/","id":1614,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1613,1612,1611],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Downed by Davis in Overtime","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Only one game this weekend mattered for the No. 25 UCSB men’s soccer team this weekend, and it failed to come away with a win.

We were hoping for that second goal, but we unfortunately didn’t get it.”</p>\n<p>In the 28th minute, UCSB finally found the back of the net on a goal from senior forward Achille Campion, who was back in the lineup for the first time since Sept. 16 due to injury. UCSB exhibited beautiful passing with junior midfielder Goffin Boyoko receiving a ball streaking towards the endline, who passed it back to Ryan in the penalty box. Ryan then sent the ball square to freshman midfielder Ema Boateng, who flicked it to Campion. Campion converted for his sixth goal of the season and give UCSB a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>“It was a nice build up play,” head coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “It’s something we hadn’t seen and something we’ve been looking for as far as combination play. It was great.”</p>\n<p>UCSB continued to dominate the possession in the first half, but went into halftime tied at one apiece due to a goal by Davis with three seconds remaining in the first half. Davis sent a ball into the box, which was headed down by junior defender Peter Schmetz. Unfortunately for the Gauchos, the header went off the heel of Boyoko and landed into feet of sophomore defender Ramon Martin del Campo, who passed the ball to sophomore forward Matt Sheldon. Sheldon sent the ball across the goal and past Mansker to equalize the game.</p>\n<p>“We kept saying, we’re due to catch a break…something has to go right,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s crazy. You’d think you’d get a break on something and we didn’t get one today. [The ball] can’t go off his heel and bounce up or go somewhere else?”</p>\n<p>Entering overtime deadlocked at one goal, Sheldon came up big once again for his team. On a long throw in by the Aggies, UCSB sophomore keeper Austin Mansker came out to grab the ball, but missed. Scrambling ensued in the box. Sheldon got a shot off, which was blocked by Schmetz on the goal line. However, Sheldon converted on the rebound.Sheldon led the Aggies offensively with the two goals on four shots.</p>\n<p>“They got a throw in, which is their best way of scoring,” Ryan said. “The ball rolled to one of their players and they put it in.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos begged the referee for a foul call, claiming Mansker was pushed and that his arm was grabbed, but was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>“We like to control the result, but I feel the ref took that away from us,” Ryan said. “He called a lot in the box the whole game and to let guys go up like that and hit our keeper is totally on him.”</p>\n<p>As the team started to walk off the field, senior defender Peter McGlynn pushed the ref to the ground, earning himself a red card. He was escorted off the field by UCSB police, although Vom Steeg said the referee doesn’t plan on pressing charges.</p>\n<p>“When you say, ‘well I think everything could go wrong,’ now it has,” Vom Steeg said. “I didn’t see it coming. Obviously, [his season is] done. There are lines you don’t cross, and if you cross the line, the privilege to be a Division I college athlete is gone.”</p>\n<p>In Friday’s non-conference match-up against Stanford, UCSB lost 1-0 on a golden goal in overtime, the team’s second consecutive loss in extra time. With the win, the Cardinal improve to 7-7-1.</p>\n<p>“We did a lot of good things, but no one wanted to score,” Vom Steeg said. “We just didn’t put the ball in the back of the net and that’s the extent of it.”</p>\n<p>It took over 95 minutes for either team to score, with Stanford securing the win on a header from their leading scorer, Adam Jahn. Sophomore midfielder Jimmy Callinan sent a beautiful cross from about midfield into the box, which Jahn snapped into the back of the net, past sophomore keeper Austin Mansker, who had no chance of saving the shot. The goal was Jahn’s ninth goal of the season.</p>\n<p>“The only thing we discussed was the fact that the only way this team was going to score was if the ball goes wide and they cross it into the box,” Vom Steeg said. “They had two guys open on that last play, so that’s a breakdown.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos outshot the Cardinal 16-12, including 7-3 in the second half, but both team shot an even four shots on goal.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t think we had a whole lot of chances, but we had some good ones that would’ve allowed us to score and take the game,” Baiden said. “We aren’t taking advantage of our opportunities.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s best opportunity came in the second half with just 21 seconds remaining in regulation when senior midfielder Dion Acoff dribbled down the left sideline before cutting in and taking a shot from the center of the 18 yard box.  Unfortunately for UCSB, the shot went wide left.</p>\n<p>“It’s frustrating because we do a lot of good things and I thought we got good performances from different players, but it’s the same repeating theme — nothing on frame,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>Leading the attack for the Gauchos was McGlynn, who took three shots on the evening.  In the first half, McGlynn struck a bending ball from the right side of the box that had Stanford’s keeper beat, but rolled just wide of the post.</p>\n<p>“I thought he hit three really good shots,” Vom Steeg said. The one was very unlucky that it went just wide of the post.  McGlynn, right now, is one of our better players and he’s playing at a high level.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will play its final two games of the regular season next week with Sac State on Wednesday.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48462\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-downed-davis-overtime/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48462\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-downed-davis-overtime/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-downed-davis-overtime/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-downed-davis-overtime/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-downed-davis-overtime/","id":1612,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1611,1610,1609],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Seeking Revenge in SLO","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men’s soccer team will play its final game of the season Saturday when the team travels to Cal Poly for a blue-green rivalry match- up.At 10-5-3 overall and 4-4-1 in the Big West, the Gauch...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s soccer team will play its final game of the season Saturday when the team travels to Cal Poly for a blue-green rivalry match-</p>\n<p>up.At 10-5-3 overall and 4-4-1 in the Big West, the Gauchos are in last place in the North Division and will miss the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 11 seasons.

Cal Poly currently holds a 10-6-1 overall and a 5-3-1 Big West.</p>\n<p>“We know we can beat any team in this league,” senior midfielder Nic Ryan said. “We’re going to go in confident. Ideally, it’d be great to go out of there with a win, but [they’ve] got their season on the line and they should be ready to go at home.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to avenge a 2-1 overtime loss at home against the Mustangs that should have been a win for UCSB. With a 1-0 lead off an incredible diving header from Ryan, Santa Barbara got caught in bad positioning and gave up a goal with just over a minute remaining in regulation. Cal Poly then prevailed on a golden goal in overtime. “We have to get them back at home,” Baiden said. “We’re going there for one purpose: to beat Cal Poly. We have to win to get revenge because we don’t like what they did to us, beating us at home.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will need to keep a closer eye on junior forward McKenzie Pridham, who tallied the golden goal, as well as an assist, in the last matchup. Pridham is Cal Poly’s primary offensive force and one of the best forwards in the Big West, ranking second in the league in points with 11 goals and an assist. He also ranks first in the Big West in game winning goals with six.</p>\n<p>“Now we have [junior defender Peter] Schmetz back and that’s huge,” Baiden said. “Any balls going over our heads, he can win. We have to keep an eye on McKenzie and make sure he doesn’t get any chances.” Leading the attack for the Gauchos will be Ryan. Ryan has had a great senior season for UCSB, leading the team in goals with eight. He also ranks third in the conference in game-winning goals with four.</p>\n<p>“Knowing it’s going to be his last game, I think [Ryan will] come out really strong,” Baiden said. “He’s playing really, really well for us this season. [He has been] huge for our team.”</p>\n<p>Another focus for UCSB will be consistent play. In the last few games, the Gauchos have often given up leads in the last few minutes of the game or early into overtime. Santa Barbara will need a full 90 minutes to find victory on the road.</p>\n<p>“Besides Sac State, overtime and losing the game in the</p>\n<p>last couple seconds have killed us,” Ryan said. “So we know we have to go out and play a full 90 minutes. Most teams score on us in the last few minutes of the first or second half. To beat Cal Poly, we have to play a complete game.”</p>\n<p>Finally, the shot count will be a key statistic for UCSB, which has found more success when the team gets forward and takes more shots. The team leads the Big West in shots with 17.56 per game and took 24 in the last game against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“The more shots you take, the more chances you have to get a goal,” Baiden said. “We have to keep shooting, but we have to make sure they’re on frame. Even if the goalie stops it, you can get a rebound.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. at Alex G. Spanos Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48587\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-02/gauchos-seeking-revenge-slo/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48587\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-02/gauchos-seeking-revenge-slo/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-02/gauchos-seeking-revenge-slo/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-02/gauchos-seeking-revenge-slo/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-02/gauchos-seeking-revenge-slo/","id":1613,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1612,1611,1610],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Soccer: Back on Top","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.6.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-8.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.6.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-8.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"No. 3 UCSB travels to UC Davis","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Off to its best start in conference play since 2009, the No. 3 UCSB men’s soccer team, leaders atop the Big West North Division will travel to UC Davis on Saturday in its first matchup against a division foe.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara enters Saturday with a 9-4 overall and a 4-0 Big West record after winning five-straight matches with a chance to extend its two game lead over Davis who sits second in the North Division at 6-6-1 overall and 2-2 in conference.</p>\n<p>“We just have to find a way to win the game; we don’t care how it happens,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Ever since the New Mexico and Stanford games where we found ways to lose, we’ve matured a little bit, gotten better.

Two weeks ago McNeely was named Big West Defensive Player of the Week, an honor awarded to senior defender Peter Schmetz on Monday, as Gauchos have owned the award the past two weeks.</p>\n<p>“From the start our goal has been to win our conference and after that the goal would be to win the conference tournament,” McNeely said. “Going beyond that, getting to the final four and far in playoffs would be a big step for the program.”</p>\n<p>Headlining the Gaucho offense is senior forward Achille Campion, who leads the team and ranks tied for fifth in the conference with five goals scored on the season. Senior midfielder Goffin Boyoko ranks right behind Campion with four goals this season.</p>\n<p>Aiding the two seniors are a pair of freshmen in midfielder Drew Murphy and forward Ismaila Jome. Murphy’s six assists this season rank tied for first in the Big West, while Jome’s five tie for fourth.</p>\n<p>The Aggies enter Saturday fresh off a 2-0 victory over Riverside, a win that ended a two-game skid in conference play.</p>\n<p>“The stats kind of tell it all for Davis. What that tells you is they can beat anybody … but then they can also lose to anybody,” Vom Steeg said. “They don’t give up a lot and they don’t get a lot and that’s a recipe for a low-scoring game, which we have been fortunate in the last two games to find a way to win. Hopefully we can do that again on Saturday.”</p>\n<p>Davis, a team known for low-scoring affairs, has scored a mere 10 goals in 13 games this season, tied for second-fewest in the Big West. Similarly, the Aggies have allowed only 11 goals this season, tied with UCSB for the fewest in the conference.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ranks third in the Big West with 20 goals scored this season as they struggled to put the ball in the back of the net early in the season. In the last four games, however, the Gauchos have scored at least two goals in every game, once putting up three in a victory over Fullerton.</p>\n<p>One key to the game may be how effectively the Gauchos can attack a stout Aggies’ defense and put a ball between the posts. Factoring in Davis’ inability to score and the Gauchos’ knack for shutting opponents down, Santa Barbara may be on its way to taking a three-game lead in the Big West north if it can score an early goal on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“We are now playing the teams in our own division and these are now six-point swings,” Vom Steeg said. “Either we jump ahead three games or we go back down to one game.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s kickoff is scheduled for 3 p.m. at Aggie Soccer Field.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em> A version of this article appeared on page 1 of October 17th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52506\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-soccer-back-on-top/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52506\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-soccer-back-on-top/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-soccer-back-on-top/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-soccer-back-on-top/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-soccer-back-on-top/","id":1611,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1610,1609,1608],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
