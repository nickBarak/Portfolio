for many graduate students’ choice to extend their degree is whether or not they will receive additional funding. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But some graduate students are saying that it is unclear how many students — faced with the cost associated with an extra year of study — will utilize this offer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just hard to get a sense of where people are at and it’s also hard to get a sense of how your research is impacted,” Alexander LeBrun, Vice President of Academic Affairs for the Graduate Student Association (GSA) and representative to the Graduate Council, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the Graduate Council is allowing three additional quarters for time-to-degree and time-to-candidacy, no additional funding is guaranteed, according to the </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18opTv7ABHar4PsMKTCg2AI0tkMKMlIeZ9Amxp8yPPuw/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FAQ sheet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about the changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the extension was offered to every graduate student, the Graduate Division expects “many, if not most, students will be able to meet their milestones and complete their degrees following the normal timelines,” according to the FAQ sheet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, LeBrun says it’s “hard to quantify” how many students could take advantage of this extension but hopes it will benefit those experiencing </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-05/as-in-person-research-goes-dormant-ucsb-researchers-explore-new-methods-of-work/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a halt to their research</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and other facets of their graduate study because of the coronavirus pandemic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Mostly, I’m thinking of people who work in labs,” he said. “There’s only a handful of labs that are currently open, and those are the essential, and also COVID-related, labs. And soon we’re going to be opening a couple more [labs], but that doesn’t account for enough graduate students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The year-long extension will also not apply to graduate student housing, which LeBrun says is already “not prioritized” by the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If there’s too many grad students and not enough housing, it seems like we’ll just have to find stuff in the community,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a third-year Philosophy Ph.D student, LeBrun doesn’t do field research or work in a lab, but said that the humanities and social sciences are still impacted by the pandemic and that those graduate students may need more time to complete their degree. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even me, who just sits at home and does my research, I’m being impacted,” he said. “My mental health is impacting my ability to do my research. It’s so hard to concentrate on arcane, philosophical questions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest determining factors for many graduate students’ choice to extend their degree is whether or not they will receive additional funding –– which LeBrun says remains uncertain for many due to budget limitations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the “time extensions will allow students to maintain funding eligibility,” according to the Graduate Division FAQ sheet, the time extension “[does] not guarantee an availability of additional funding.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funding for graduate students, determined either by their department as teaching assistants or research assistants, covers their tuition and health insurance, and provides a salary, LeBrun says.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s no guarantee to get funding for that next year. It’s up to either your department if you’re a TA, or your advisor if you’re in research whether they have the resources to pay you.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LeBrun worries that some graduate students who have no choice but to extend their degree will be forced to take out loans if they don’t receive additional funding from departments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s only a limited number of TAships for each department and if you have to give one to a student who has extended their time-to-degree, then that means another student doesn’t get that TAship,” LeBrun said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Securing funding and housing, in addition to completing their degrees, are stressors to graduate students, who also take on the role of instructors as TAs –– a role that has only grown more difficult since the start of remote learning, LeBrun said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the vote to extend degree timelines, LeBrun says GSA has just been doing “damage control” to help graduate students. Recently, GSA diverted all graduate student fees –– normally used for events during spring quarter –– to a </span><a href=\"https://gsa.ucsb.edu/covid19\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 relief grant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, providing over $30,000 of relief to students who are particularly impacted, according to LeBrun. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m hoping that a system will be worked out where there’s a pot of money for those [graduate students choosing to extend] to continue to get funding, or at least reduced tuition or something like that.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94805\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94805\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/","id":1,"author":{"id":234,"name":"Madeline Thompson"},"related":[0,-1,-2],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":234,"name":"Madeline Thompson","biography":"Not available","articles":[1,1839,1961,2003,2015,3272],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[]},"__N_SSG":true}
