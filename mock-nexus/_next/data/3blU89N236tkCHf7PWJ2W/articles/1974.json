however, it is important to acknowledge the factor of race as the racial injustice of mass incarceration and prejudice that were present in Iverson’s case remain highly prevalent in the jailing of blacks — specifically males — nationwide.</p>\n<p>Categorized and stereotyped as a thug and delinquent for his appearance and character, Iverson represented and still displays the misunderstanding individuals of the black community currently experience.</p>\n<p>In addition to his greatness on the court, the framework to the legacy of Allen Iverson originates within the persevering identity that has helped define people of color for centuries.</p>\n<p>The aura of AI lives on forever; I just hope that the misconceived perception of such a legend will not overshadow what he stands for.</p>\n<p>Thanks, Bubba Chuck.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69543\" style=\"width: 471px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69543\" data-attachment-id=\"69543\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/the-answer-unveiled-ais-legacy-beyond-the-court/fullsizerender-6/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FullSizeRender.jpg?fit=750%2C738&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"750,738\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"FullSizeRender\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FullSizeRender.jpg?fit=250%2C246&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FullSizeRender.jpg?fit=750%2C738&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-69543\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FullSizeRender.jpg?resize=461%2C453\" alt=\"Photo Courtesy of Sean White\" width=\"461\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FullSizeRender.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FullSizeRender.jpg?resize=250%2C246&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FullSizeRender.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FullSizeRender.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69543\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo Courtesy of Sean White</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 7, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The two have deflected title talk and motivated their less-expensive squads better than any of the coaches at the so-called “big clubs,” including Jose Mourinho, who was fired midseason, and Louis Van Gaal and Arsene Wenger, who are also fighting to keep their jobs before the season comes to a close.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The biggest difference between the two teams at the top and those chasing them isn’t how deep their pockets are, but how incredibly strategic both Leicester and Tottenham have been with spending their money.</p>\n<p>With Pochettino at the helm, the Spurs boasts a roster peppered with homegrown talent such as Ryan Mason and the league’s current goals leader (21) in Harry Kane. While the club has benefited from its choice in local talent, the manager’s best bit of business has resulted through the transfer market, specifically the addition of young attacking midfielder Deli Alli for just over 6 million pounds last winter.</p>\n<p>Via ESPNFC, The English international has scored seven goals and tallied nine assists in his first year as a starter, and has looked like one of the best bargains in recent history this season. With a core of Kane, Alli and Christian Eriksen, the north London team looks like one that could surpass bitter rival Arsenal while becoming a perennial contender.</p>\n<p>While Tottenham ignited its rise in talent through the promotion of youthful players and diligent work in the transfer market, their calculated approach is incomparable to the wonder-deals pulled off to build the Leicester squad that finds itself only seven games away from the club’s first ever title.</p>\n<p>The Foxes’ starting lineup cost a mere 32.5 million euros, 20 million of which was spent on breakout starts N’Golo Kante and Shinji Okazaki alone.</p>\n<p>To put that in perspective, Manchester City paid 75 million for Kevin DeBruyne and 62 million for Raheem Sterling in the offseason. Although they have performed well since moving to Manchester, the Citizens, who were widely considered the favorites to win the Prem, sit in fourth place by a margin of fifteen points behind the leaders.</p>\n<p>Yet, Leicester’s most noteworthy pick up was the signing of Riyad Mahrez from AC Le Havre, a second division French team, for a mere 500 thousand euros. Mahrez has absolutely lit up the league, leading his side’s attack week after week, finding the net 16 times and setting up his teammates another 19, ranking best in the EPL.</p>\n<p>The Algeria international is the frontrunner for the Player of the Year award in his debut season and will surely attract monumental offers from football giants across Europe, and even if he does move on at the end of the season, Leicester’s maestro has been one of the greatest signings in Premier League history.</p>\n<p>Still, the most prevalent issue that remains for both the Spurs and Foxes will be finding a way to contain their key players by helping them to fend off the temptations of the riches that will be offered by teams such as United, Chelsea, City and whoever else.</p>\n<p>But, the championship potential of this season must remain at the forefront for both clubs as they have refreshed the EPL with a process of team building that does not revolve around the spending of hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the richer clubs will take note that it’s not always about buying the most expensive players, but rather the players that fit together and work as a unit to get results.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>All statistics credit to transfermarkt.com and ESPNFC.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69085\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-24/premier-league-title-race-proves-money-cant-buy-titles/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69085\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-24/premier-league-title-race-proves-money-cant-buy-titles/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-24/premier-league-title-race-proves-money-cant-buy-titles/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-24/premier-league-title-race-proves-money-cant-buy-titles/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-24/premier-league-title-race-proves-money-cant-buy-titles/","id":1972,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1971,1970,1969],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"King James: Cleveland’s Savior or Fallen Hope?","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-03-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/lebron-01.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/lebron-01.png?resize=980%2C558&ssl=1","description":"The No. 1 overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft, LeBron James has been crowned as the king of the league despite entering with his high school status.

Although early exits are not a usual situation for James, lingering and arguably haunting his career is his 2-4 NBA Finals record.</p>\n<p>The four series losses tie the amount of NBA Finals losses by Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and Larry Bird combined.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Despite his five consecutive visits to the NBA Finals, James has lost back-to-back championship series as well. While with Miami, James and the Heat were nearly swept by the San Antonio Spurs losing the series 4-1 in the 2014 NBA Finals. After gaining a 2-1 lead, LeBron and the Cavaliers endured a 4-2 series loss to the Golden State Warriors in the 2015 NBA Finals.</p>\n<p>Unable to three-peat as a championship winner, a sixth consecutive NBA Finals appearance this season could warrant an undesired three-peat of three consecutive title losses for King James. Simply put, James cannot afford another championship series loss.</p>\n<p>Commonly critiqued for abandoning the Cleveland Cavaliers and “buying” his back-to-back championship rings by teaming up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh while with the Miami Heat, James’ career and legacy remains incomplete without a ring in his native state of Ohio.</p>\n<p>A three-peat with Miami would have elevated James’ stature in comparison to the success of NBA legends Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, who have both achieved the feat in each of their careers (Jordan twice). The absence of the Larry O’brien trophy in the city of Cleveland can certainly be attributed to LBJ’s return to Cleveland last season.</p>\n<p>After last season’s NBA Finals loss, the time is now or never for the sake of James’ legacy as one of the greatest to play the game to win a much-needed third championship ring.</p>\n<p>With the Cavaliers currently in first-place of the Eastern Conference with a 52-22 record and eight games remaining on the their regular season schedule, the routine ‘Zero Dark Thirty’ mode that James enters each postseason — disengaging from all forms of social media — may need a sooner start than the beginning of the NBA Playoffs on April 16.</p>\n<p>Aside from the hysteria surrounding James’ subliminal social media statements, skepticism regarding his relationship with teammates and other distractive storylines that continue to surmount, the Cleveland Cavaliers currently don’t look like a team capable of winning the NBA Finals.</p>\n<p>Possessing a 6-4 record in their last 10 games, hindering the Cavs’ case in the lasting stretch of the season, has been recent losses to subpar teams such as the Brooklyn Nets, Houston Rockets and Utah Jazz, along with a blowout loss to the playoff contending Miami Heat nearly two weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Although Cleveland’s latest antics haven’t been convincing of it winning the NBA Finals, there remains no doubt that the team from ‘The Land’ will represent the Eastern Conference come this June.</p>\n<p>Sure, the Toronto Raptors, who are on pace to set a new franchise wins record in addition to being just 2.0 games behind the Cavs for first place while holding a 2-1 tiebreaker advantage, along with the Atlanta Hawks, Boston Celtics or Miami Heat each have a chance to meet Cleveland in the conference finals, but can any of these teams truly compete and win a seven-game series against the Cavaliers?</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, fueling the Cavaliers journey to the NBA Finals are last postseason’s losses of Kevin Love in the first round of the playoffs vs the Celtics and Kyrie Irving in overtime of Game 1 of the NBA Finals.</p>\n<p>Prior to Cleveland’s return to the playoffs since James’ departure in 2010, neither Love nor Irving had a postseason appearance.</p>\n<p>While Love’s presence in the Finals would have only enhanced the Cavaliers’ matchup against the Warriors, the loss of Irving was most devastating to their chances of winning.</p>\n<p>The team’s leading three-point shooter at 41.5 percent and second in scoring at 21.7 points per game last season, the dependence of Irving as another ‘go-to’ player was lost as he fractured his left knee cap in overtime of Game 1 of the Finals.</p>\n<p>While it is nearly impossible to refute the Warriors’ championship victory, Irving’s presence could have reduced the Cavs’ overdependence  on James. A definite top-five point guard in the NBA, the now three-time All-Star had 23 points, seven rebounds, six assists, four steals and two blocks in the series opening game along with the game saving block to help send it into overtime.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qit15vtspoM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Still, there is some cause for concern as the Cavaliers have struggled against top-tier opponents this season. Moreover, Cleveland is 19-15 versus teams with a record of .500 and above, while it is 33-7 against teams below .500.</p>\n<p>After firing David Blatt in his second year with the team despite the Cavs’ 30-11 start this season, now under the helm of first year Head Coach Tyronn Lue, Cleveland is 22-11 since Lue’s hiring on Jan. 22.</p>\n<p>With the postseason approaching, one must wonder if Lue, in his first year as Head Coach and will enter the playoffs with 41 games coached at the end of the regular season, is capable of helping pave the way for the Cavaliers to win it all? Not to mention, is the team really HIS team? Throughout a majority of the Cavs’ 106-100 loss to Houston Tuesday night, James was seen on the court, sideline, and even in the team’s huddle during timeouts making commands as if Lue wasn’t there.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6AOQ9fyErr4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Blamed for the firing of Blatt, it’d be wise for James to accept his role as a player with regard to helping his coach receive as little scrutiny as possible as there hasn’t been much of a difference in the team since Lue’s takeover which only leaves eyebrows raised at if the Cavaliers bothered a situation that didn’t need tuning.</p>\n<p>But Lue has somewhat borrowed a page from Spurs’ Head Coach Gregg Popovich’s book by resting players like James, Love and Irving as the postseason approaches in hopes of preserving their health. The decision can only be beneficial for the players, especially James after missing a career-high 13 games last season in addition to having played nearly 40,000 career minutes.</p>\n<p>Yet, in attempt to add some playoff experience to its roster, Cleveland’s additions of veterans such as Richard Jefferson during the offseason, Channing Frye in free agency and the return of Mo Williams show the Cavs’ effort to close in on its first NBA title in franchise history.</p>\n<p>Whether Cleveland faces Golden State or San Antonio in the NBA Finals, James seems to be aware of the foreshadowing pressure surrounding his legacy and the urgency to win another ring. Nonetheless, adding to this pressure is the continuous championship drought that has burdened the city of Cleveland since 1964, in which the Cleveland Browns won a championship in the pre- Super Bowl era.</p>\n<p>With players like Steph Curry and Kawhi Leonard earning the nod in the conversation of being the NBA’s best player, there’s no doubt that a chip is sitting on King James’ shoulder to remind the world that the 4-time NBA MVP is still around.</p>\n<p>Yet, it is both of these players and their respective teams that have stifled James in the past. If either manage to defeat him again, it may be the foretelling of the ‘King’s’ dethroning.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69174\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-31/king-james-clevelands-savior-or-fallen-hope/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69174\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-31/king-james-clevelands-savior-or-fallen-hope/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-31/king-james-clevelands-savior-or-fallen-hope/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-31/king-james-clevelands-savior-or-fallen-hope/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-31/king-james-clevelands-savior-or-fallen-hope/","id":1971,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1970,1969,1968],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Latest Mountain Lion Sighting Actually Bobcat, Previous Sightings Confirmed As Mountain Lions","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-10-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Best-Date-Spot-Campus-Point-by-Tatiana-Karme-Scalisi.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Best-Date-Spot-Campus-Point-by-Tatiana-Karme-Scalisi.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Students are cautioned to stay away from the area until further notice. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em>Update [10/8/19 2:49 p.m.] </em>UC Santa Barbara issued an update less than 20 minutes after the Tuesday afternoon notification, announcing that the most recent mountain lion sighting reported was in fact a bobcat, one who “has lived in the area for many years without issue.”</p>\n<p>They also said that previous sightings of mountain lions were confirmed to be mountain lions.</p>\n<p><em>Update [10/8/19 2:28 p.m.] </em>UC Santa Barbara sent out an emergency notification Tuesday afternoon about a fifth mountain lion sighting, this time “west of the Orfalea Childcare Center,” which is on West Campus.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police are in the area and California Fish and Wildlife have been notified, according to the alert.
