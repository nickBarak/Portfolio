Demonstrators wore bright capes, colorful clothes and coin skirts while holding up signs advocating for consent. Event organizers gave out candy, pins and hugs to attendees. The demonstration aimed to address and prevent sexual assault during Isla Vista’s Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>According to “Fuck Your Standards” founder and third-year global studies major Gabby O’Neal rape culture is a philosophy that promotes rape and victim blaming.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Like in music, the way music hyper-sexualizes people, the way men feel entitled to women and to women’s bodies … Why is that okay?” Barnett said. “Why aren’t we talking about why people are raping.”</p>\n<p>UCSB C.A.R.E. member and fourth-year feminist studies and sociology double-major Dalyla Meyers said O’Neal invited the C.A.R.E. office to join #PledgeforConsent.</p>\n<p>“It was definitely something that aligned with our office and the different things we are trying to combat, such as rape culture,” Meyers said.</p>\n<p>Meyers said students must discuss consent and rape culture to reduce sexual assault on college campuses.</p>\n<p>Fuck Your Standards and the #PledgeforConsent event page on Facebook will be posting messages on consent and sexual assault to further

mathematician Yitang Zhang will be joining UC Santa Barbara’s mathematics faculty this fall, a development many hope will add further prestige to the university.</p>\n<p>Zhang became famous in 2013 when he submitted a proof to the Annals of Mathematics which established the first finite bound on gaps between twin prime numbers, a feat many believed to be impossible. The New Yorker magazine published a profile on Zhang in February, and Filmmaker George Csicsery premiered a documentary on Zhang called “Counting from Infinity” in January. Zhang’s major breakthrough earned him numerous awards and honors, including the 2013 Ostrowski Prize, the 2014 Frank Nelson Cole Prize in Number Theory, election to the Academia Sinica fellowship in 2014 and tenure professorship at the University of New Hampshire in 2014.<br>\nUCSB mathematics professor and number theory specialist Jeffrey Stopple said it is unusual for mathematicians to be featured in The New Yorker.</p>\n<p>“He’s probably at this point one of the most famous mathematicians in the world,” Stopple said. “I think there might be only maybe two or three others alive that have his level of celebrity.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang said he hosted Zhang’s visit to UCSB during a mathematics department colloquium in May and he personally invited Zhang to join the faculty as a professor.</p>\n<p>“I was honored to be able to host his visit to our campus and to invite him to become a professor, a colleague and a friend on our campus,” Yang said in an email.<br>\nAccording to UCSB professor emeritus in mathematics Martin Scharlemann, Zhang currently stands as one of the most prestigious professors at the university.</p>\n<p>“There are various types of prestige in mathematics. One is to be known by experts in your field and another is to be known by the general public,” Scharlemann said. “At least in the second category, he’s probably the most remarkable here at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>UCSB mathematics department chair and professor Darren Long said he hopes Zhang’s presence in UCSB’s math department will increase the amount of interactions between professors and expand the department’s range of research.</p>\n<p>“This is not an enormous department, so we don’t have representation in every field possible,” Long said. “He is somebody that opens up a vista in that way.”<br>\nAccording to Stopple, hiring Zhang will significantly increase the university’s prestige and will attract even more students in the future.</p>\n<p>“I think it raises the profile of the campus enormously,” Stopple said. “In terms of recruiting new students at UCSB, I think at all levels people will want to be here.”</p>\n<p>Long said he offered Zhang a reduced teaching load to start, but assumes Zhang will want to increase it because of his extensive teaching history at the University of New Hampshire.</p>\n<p>“It is my impression that he will want to teach undergraduates from time to time,” Long said. “I expect he will succeed.”</p>\n<p>University of Massachusetts Boston mathematics professor and former University of New Hampshire’s mathematics department chair Eric Grinberg said Zhang has always been a humble faculty member, despite his worldwide fame.</p>\n<p>“He was always very modest and unassuming and he certainly never boasted of anything,” Grinberg said. “Even though he’s become world famous, I don’t think that’s changed too much.”</p>\n<p>Grinberg said students at the University of New Hampshire found Zhang’s teaching style to be “very much accessible” and “easy to follow.”</p>\n<p>“Some people might try to impress everybody by how deep their work is and get them lost in technicalities,” Grinberg said. “Yitang Zhang doesn’t do that.”</p>\n<p>Stopple said Zhang’s next goal is to solve the Landau-Siegel Theorem, an important piece of a larger and more difficult problem called the Riemann Hypothesis, a 150 year-old mathematical conjecture with a one million dollar prize attached to it.</p>\n<p>“He sets his sights very high and I’m very impressed by him,” Stopple said. “Even the piece that he’s working on would make him famous all over again if he wasn’t already famous.”</p>\n<p>Stopple said it is unlikely Zhang will be able to solve the Landau-Siegel Theorem during his time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“In some sense, it would be like someone being struck by lightning twice,” Stopple said. “It’s ambitious to try, but he’s the guy who’s willing to try stuff like that.”</p>\n<p>Yang said UCSB is an ideal place for Zhang to teach while also conducting research.</p>\n<p>“Our campus provides both the intellectual environment and spectacular beauty for him to enjoy continuing his research to solve unsolvable math problems while also teaching our students,” Yang said in an email.</p>\n<p>Yitang Zhang was unavailable for comment.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 in the Thursday, Sept. 17, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The event, which promotes dialogue around mental health issues in hopes of combating suicide, debuted with a display at the National Mall in Washington, D.C. in 2008. Since then, more than 320,000 people in 98 cities throughout the country have experienced Send Silence Packing.</p>\n<p>Active Minds’ Send Silence Packing Coordinator Lee Duffy-Ledbetter said one goal of the event was to encourage people to utilize mental health services.</p>\n<p>“We are also attempting to change the stigma that surrounds these topics so that people feel more comfortable engaging in those early prevention methods or seeking help if they need it,” Duffy-Ledbetter said.</p>\n<p>Duffy-Ledbetter said the display also calls attention to the issue of college suicide for those who might not realize its prevalence.</p>\n<p>“A lot of students have been engaging with the display and reading a lot of stories,” Duffy-Ledbetter said. “People have been coming up surprised or shocked at the amount of bags.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65289\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Silence_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"365067884\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65304\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65289\" data-attachment-id=\"65289\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/send-silence-packing-display-recognized-1100-college-student-lives-lost-to-suicide/silence_by-effie-sklavenitis-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Silence_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"10\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5300\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1444601049\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Silence_by Effie Sklavenitis-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Silence_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Silence_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-65289\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Silence_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?resize=750%2C500\" alt=\"Effie Sklavenitis/Daily Nexus\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Silence_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Silence_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Silence_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Silence_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65289\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Effie Sklavenitis/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB Active Minds co-president and fourth-year psychology major Melissa Boomer said many people are unwilling to talk about mental health issues, something she hopes Send Silence Packing will change.</p>\n<p>“There is so much stigma around it,” Boomer said. “I hope that seeing this, having it be pretty confronting, will allow people to open up a dialogue.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Active Minds co-president Urvashi Singh said she was pleased with how many students came to the display and spoke with Active Minds members.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people came up to us and wanted to talk about what this event is about,” Singh said. “Some of them shared their stories with us and how they have been impacted by something like this or know someone who has.”</p>\n<p>Third-year communication major Erika Peralta said there is a “good amount” of mental health services available to students, and taking advantage of these services can “have a huge impact.”</p>\n<p>“It’s just taking that step and reaching out and getting help when you need it,” Peralta said.</p>\n<p>Third-year anthropology major Erica Nadler said she was “taken aback” by the fact that most college students who commit suicide do so without first seeking out mental health services.</p>\n<p>“[There] seems to be a common pattern leading up to it,” Nadler said. “It’s just so sad.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
