They endured their lone league loss in the last match to UC Davis just three days after winning the North division and clinching the top record in the conference.</p>\n<p>Fullerton travels to Harder following a penalty shootout win over the Aggies in the first round after finishing the season second in the South division at 9-8-4 overall, 4-3-3 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“Last year they beat us and lifted the trophy in front of our crowd, in our stadium,” junior midfielder Kevin Feucht said. “We outshot them something like 23-3, so we want a rematch now.”</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the meeting as clear favorites after a near-perfect Big West season, and the team’s dominance in recent weeks was recognized over the weekend when the conference released its annual All-Big West Awards.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had nine players honored, led by senior forward Nick DePuy, who won the Offensive Player of the Year for a third straight season, and junior midfielder Kevin Feucht was named the Midfielder of the Year.</p>\n<p>Attackers junior Ahinga Selemani and senior Josue España were the other two teammates named to the All-Conference First Team to go along with three Honorable Mentions and three All-Freshman mentions. UCSB was the most represented side in the league in the regular season awards.</p>\n<p>“It shows that we have strong players and a quality team,” Feucht said. “It goes to show how much we’ve found each other this year, and we were unbeaten until the last game in conference so we’ve shown we’re a good team.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Cal State Fullerton had its fair share of match-winners too. Senior striker Alex Heilmann leads the Big West with 11 goals and was one of three Titans named to the All-Conference First and Second Teams. The other First Teamer, senior defender Ricardo Covarrubias, anchors the Big West’s best back line, as CSUF have allowed a measly 1.12 goals per game.</p>\n<p>The other First Teamer, senior defender Ricardo Covarrubias, anchors the Big West’s best back line, as CSUF have allowed a measly 1.12 goals per game.</p>\n<p>In hopes of countering the Titan’s sheisty defense, the Gauchos bring plenty of firepower up top, averaging 1.58 goals for almost 0.3 goals per game more than CSUN, the second most prolific offense in the conference.</p>\n<p>Much of the threat comes from the trio of Selemani having tallied seven goals, DePuy with six and Feucht rounding things out with 10, whose interchanging runs in the front have picked open Big West opposition all season long. España leads UCSB with seven assists.</p>\n<p>“You have to ask me after the game whether we’re the best offense or they’re the best defense,” Feucht said. “We have to play to find out.’</p>\n<p>When the two teams faced off earlier this season at Fullerton, the host gave the Gauchos a tough match, but the visitors ended up heading back to Santa Barbara with a 2-1 overtime win thanks to Kevin Feucht’s match winner on an assist from España. The Gauchos star-studded attack will pose the sternest test Fullerton has faced in weeks.</p>\n<p>As for injuries, all of the regulars are healthy for UCSB, and the highly promising freshman midfielder Daniel Amo, who has missed most of the season with a groin injury that he aggravated again at home against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Amo is hoping to fight back into the team as the postseason picks up. His injury against Poly was far less serious than his first setback of the year, keeping him out of training for a couple weeks, but the first-year product has a chance to come back into the squad in the next match.</p>\n<p>The semifinal will take place at Harder Stadium on Wednesday, Nov. 9 at 7 p.m. Follow <em>@thenexus_sports</em> for all things Gaucho soccer.</p><div

any athlete’s physical and mental strength. Having your passion ripped away from you for long periods of time from something as mundane as an off-balance fall is a fate none wish to encounter.</p>\n<p>Junior outside hitter Ali Barbeau of the UCSB women’s volleyball team is among those to have experienced and beaten one of the most dreaded plagues of knee injuries – the torn ACL – suffering the injury in the last game of her high school volleyball season at Salinas High School.</p>\n<p>“It was a tight set. I went up and I hit as hard as I could and landed on one leg. My knee collapsed and I fell,” Barbeau said. “I remember thinking I broke my leg. It was the weirdest feeling ever.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The reality did not hit Barbeau until several painful experiences and a trip to the doctor’s office, which left her diagnosed with a torn ACL and a 9-12 month recovery time. This also meant that she would be unable to play her senior club season and possibly her freshman year at UCSB.</p>\n<p>After a faster-than-expected recovery time, Barbeau was back on the court in six months to make her first appearance for the Gauchos. However, the journey did not end there. The road to recovery was admittedly frustrating for Barbeau and challenged her mentally, but she claims that she never considered giving up.</p>\n<p>“I had a rough time coming back my freshman year from my ACL tear. (Former Head Coach) Kathy Gregory expected me to come in and be a starter, and I did too,” Barbeau said. “When that didn’t happen it was really disappointing, and by the end of my freshman season I was pretty frustrated. But during my sophomore season, [Nicole Lantagne Welch] came in and kind of re-lit the hope that I would be a starter.”</p>\n<p>Despite limited playing time, she gained confidence as she appeared in 23 matches in her first season, recording 69 kills and 36 digs.</p>\n<p>“When I first came back, I was really slow physically and I couldn’t jump very high, so, I struggled especially on defense,” Barbeau said. “There was always the fear that I would tear it again, and on similar plays to when I tore it, I was scared to really go for it.”</p>\n<p>Barbeau also suffered a broken finger in her sophomore year, as she recalls that her pinky went crooked after she deflected a kill with her hand in a moment that almost caused her to pass out.</p>\n<p>An inspiration to those on her team, her teammate sophomore outside hitter Ali Spindt describes Barbeau to be “a leader on and off the court, and someone who we have come to turn to when we need a kill and a key player.”</p>\n<p>During her time at UCSB, Barbeau splits her time as an athlete and as a student, studying biopsychology. In addition to her stellar performances this season, Barbeau played every match for the Gauchos in 2013 and recorded double-digit kills fourteen times on her way to being named to the All-Big West First Team.</p>\n<p>“[Barbeau] is a reliant captain that’s always working hard on and off the court,” junior libero Shauna Klein said. “She’s confident and wants the ball at all times during the match. She’s made a huge impact on our team this season.”</p>\n<p>Watch Barbeau and the Gauchos take on Hawaii on Nov. 21 at the Thunderdome after her team returns from a two-game road-trip this weekend against Cal State Northridge and Long Beach State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of November 13, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58205\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/ali-barbeau-from-the-sidelines-to-the-top-of-the-stat-sheet/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58205\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/ali-barbeau-from-the-sidelines-to-the-top-of-the-stat-sheet/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/ali-barbeau-from-the-sidelines-to-the-top-of-the-stat-sheet/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/ali-barbeau-from-the-sidelines-to-the-top-of-the-stat-sheet/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/ali-barbeau-from-the-sidelines-to-the-top-of-the-stat-sheet/","id":1411,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[1410,1409,1408],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos in Vulnerable State, Hopeful in Final Two Matches of Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2016-10-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-29-at-11.22.11-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-29-at-11.22.11-AM.png?resize=883%2C456&ssl=1","description":"After experiencing back-to-back defeats for the first time this season, UCSB is ready to turn it around in the final week of Big West regular season play.

In order to continue that success, the Gauchos will need to rely on the backbone of their team: their defense.</p>\n<p>While the numbers prove that UCSB has been more than capable of scoring goals, being able to hold other teams to a limited amount of scoring opportunities is just as important when it comes to the team’s game plan.</p>\n<p>“Keeping opposing teams to zero or one goal takes a lot of pressure off of our attackers,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “Now, to win a game, we might only need one or two goals of our own. Our team defending has been a significant part of our success this year.”</p>\n<p>Gaucho starting sophomore goalkeeper Brittney Rogers has been a huge asset to her team this year. Collecting 38 saves and six shutouts, she has played a valuable and effective role in the team’s defense. Without her achievements this year in protecting the net, the Gauchos would not likely hold the successful winning record they currently possess.</p>\n<p>Similarly, junior forward Amanda Ball has made major contributions this season, having scored a Big-West-leading 10 goals. Sophomore forward Mallory Hromatko and freshman midfielder Shaelan Murison are also key offensive players with four goals each.</p>\n<p>Leading UCSB’s charge in setting up these attackers with scores has been sophomore midfielder Maddie Gibson, who leads the team with five assists.</p>\n<p>Senior midfielder Ashley Dean, senior defender Savannah Francis, senior midfielder Dakota Griggs and sophomore midfielder Sydney Magnin have also contributed on the assisting end with three apiece.</p>\n<p>The UC Davis Aggies currently sit with the Gauchos in fourth place in the standings; however, UCSB leads them in multiple offensive categories. In the key category of goals scored, the Gauchos have tallied 28 this season to the Aggies’ 21. Another key category is corner kicks where Davis has earned 83 while the Gauchos have put together 111.</p>\n<p>However, as with every game, it will be important for UCSB to go into this match treating the Aggies as a tough competitor capable of defeating any team.</p>\n<p>“It would be a mistake by our players to think we can just show up and win. [UC Davis] are going to be tough no matter what their record is,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>With that being said, there are a number of impact players on the UC Davis roster that cannot be overlooked.</p>\n<p>In the front of the field, the veteran duo of senior forwards Celina Minissian and Rachel Ahr has led UC Davis on offense as both have currently scored four goals each. Also contributing are sophomore forward Crystal Crump and freshman forward Nicole Carson, as both lead the team with three assists each.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Alexis Smith has been the permanent goalkeeper for the Aggies as she has played every game from start to finish, collecting a total of 65 saves and five shutouts.</p>\n<p>Long Beach State will make for a more challenging opponent as it sits one place above the Gauchos in the Big West standings.

The Titans will hope to secure their third straight conference title.</p>\n<p>After a slow start to the match, CSUF started to grab a hold of the tempo and was quickly rewarded for its early energy when freshman forward Rei Dorwart’s sweetly struck effort found the top-right corner to give the visitors a 1-0 lead in the match’s ninth minute.</p>\n<p>The Titans maintained control throughout the majority of the first half, limiting the Gauchos’ potent attack to just three shots. The top seeded Gauchos entered the half down 1-0, struggling to create anything up front.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t get to enough balls first tonight,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Like everything else, we’ve got a long offseason to look at that. We discussed this all year, and this is the first UCSB team in some time that had no wide play on either side.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton struck almost immediately at the start of the second half when a poor UCSB clearance bounced to Fullerton’s sophomore midfielder Ross McPhie.</p>\n<p>McPhie capitalized on the possession when his low shot rolled to the right of UCSB goalkeeper Brandon Berke for the score to double Fullerton’s lead to 2-0. The second goal forced the Gauchos to pick up the pace for the last 43 minutes, but the Titans’ conference-best defense was up to the test.</p>\n<p>After several scoring opportunities and corner kicks, UCSB reached the back of the net in the 64th minute when freshman winger Noah Billingsley beat his man down the flank before firing in a hard low ball across the face of the goal post, in which Feucht was there to pounce on the chance.</p>\n<p>For the next 15 minutes, the Gauchos controlled the pace of play and looked likely to score, but were unable to find the equalizer.</p>\n<p>Senior midfielder Josue España, who had been playing with a slight knee injury since the first Cal Poly game, looked to be reinjured after a hard challenge on the counter.</p>\n<p>Although he returned for five minutes, the team’s assist leader garnering seven assists had to come out early in the last game of his impressive two-year stay at Harder. Playing through injury, the senior managed to bring the home crowd to its feet on several occasions with his flicks and tricks before his exit.</p>\n<p>España and Billingsley looked the most likely to create the game-tying chance, and the latter came within inches as his header from the middle of the box slipped just left of the frame.</p>\n<p>Feucht and Big West Offensive Player of the Year senior forward Nick DePuy each led the Gauchos with three shots, but Fullerton eventually regained control for the final 10 minutes to see out their second straight postseason victory at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“DePuy has had a great four years, three-time Big West Offensive Player of the year, but I think the one player that kind of drove our team and made so much happen for us was Josue,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>An All-Big West First Team selection in 2015, España provided another dynamic to the Gauchos’ gameplan in his ability to play both on and off the ball.</p>\n<p>“We wish he could’ve come as a freshman but we got him for two years, and you’ll take what you get,” Vom Steeg said. “From that Cal Poly game and on, he has been giving us what he can, but it’s just not 100 percent. When he started to slow down offensively, we really started to slow down because he was the one player that could get us through the midfield.”</p>\n<p>The semifinal was the last match of five Gauchos’ collegiate careers as DePuy, España, midfielder Riley Peterson, midfielder Josue Salgado and captain midfielder Andy Perez will move onto their post-UCSB endeavors.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the graduating class, their final year wasn’t topped off with a conference or national championship, but Vom Steeg will have several holes to fill before the start of next season, a testament to how crucial the outgoing class was to the team’s success.</p>\n<p>Fullerton and CSUN, the two top teams from the South division, will now face off in Northridge Saturday night for the Big West crown.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74157\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-11/gauchos-season-ends-with-2-1-semis-loss-to-cal-state-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74157\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-11/gauchos-season-ends-with-2-1-semis-loss-to-cal-state-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-11/gauchos-season-ends-with-2-1-semis-loss-to-cal-state-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-11/gauchos-season-ends-with-2-1-semis-loss-to-cal-state-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-11/gauchos-season-ends-with-2-1-semis-loss-to-cal-state-fullerton/","id":1409,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1408,1407,1406],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
