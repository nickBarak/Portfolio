The new space is 981 square feet and has two offices and a bathroom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center currently has approximately 550 square feet and is composed of one small room and an office. But this current space is not large enough to accommodate to students in need of private meeting spaces, according to Coby Dillard, veterans and military services coordinator.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dillard said an ideal “one-stop shop” resource center would have an academic advisor, a counselor and a certifying official who can double as a financial aid representative and provide any other resources that an incoming veteran student would need, all in one place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, Dillard said, when a student comes to the center, he can “help to a degree,” but at the end of the day, he often has to direct them to multiple different places. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Research says that if you have individuals who can come into a single location and get all their assistance, over the long-term, they perform better academically,” Dillard added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new location takes a step toward a “one-stop shop” with larger square footage and dedicated meeting rooms, which Dillard can use to set up office hours for various advisors to drop in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Dillard isn’t the first one who has tried to turn the center into a “one-stop shop.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2014, two student veterans presented a list of <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-04-10/veterans-fight-for-more-resources-at-ucsb/\">grievances and demands</a> for change to Chancellor Henry T. Yang. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First on the list of demands was a “space that can continuously accommodate quiet study, lounge, peer to peer tutoring, mental health and VA counseling…. These rooms will not be decentralized and will share a similar location or structure.” But Dillard described this demand as only partially fulfilled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2014, the center occupied a 10-by-10 foot space in building 477, across the courtyard from the current office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of the demands, roughly 400 members of the entire student body were military-related, which includes veterans, military dependents, reserve duty students and more. Dillard said that number has now increased to over 520. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the one-stop shop model is years in the making, the center’s high staff turnover made it difficult for any real progress to be made, according to Dillard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dillard is the fourth person since 2012 to run the program. The first two coordinators stepped down to go back to school, and the third served as an interim coordinator until Dillard was hired in July 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staff turnover is also the reason why so many of the unspoken agreements that the center has with other departments on campus are not formal policies, Dillard said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Institutionally, a lot of our policies exist, but they’re not formalized anywhere,” Dillard said. “I know all the veterans get priority registration… And then the question in here is ‘Is there a formal written policy?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of my relationships with other offices across campus are based on understandings that have worked, not necessarily formal policy.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Dillard came to UCSB, his goal for his first year was “just stabilizing the place.” From there, Dillard said he moved on to assessing which areas of the center were in need of the most attention, and how he could best go about fixing them next year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In September 2018, U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked UCSB as the number four public school in the nation for veterans and 10th nationwide </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but Dillard finds that “rankings like that don’t necessarily reflect what the student experience is because that particular ranking did not ask any questions about the student experience.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, Dillard finds that the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Military Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s survey, “Best for Vets” is a better metric as it accounts for “services and student experience.” Next year, Dillard plans to have veteran students at UCSB complete the survey so the university can be ranked on the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Military Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> survey.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dillard’s ideas for the center stem from years of experience of working with veterans, most recently in Virginia Beach, Va. Dillard said that coming to UCSB and working as a coordinator was the next progression for his career. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After doing this for seven, eight years, this is kind of the next progression for me career-wise,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The next natural step is to run a program and if you’re going to run a program, [UCSB’s program] wouldn’t be bad to start with [because it is] one that is in need of some sort of strengthening.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For his first Memorial Day at UCSB, Dillard wanted to not only honor former and current service members, but also make the holiday more visible to the school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, the Veterans and Military Services program installed a “flag garden” made up of 2,000 flags planted in the open green space between the Annex and Storke Lawn.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think everyone either appreciated it being there, or once they were told why it was there, then they appreciated it being there,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Events like this are one way for Dillard and the program to increase visibility and awareness of veteran students on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Dillard has several aspirations for the center in the next few years, the most significant one is emphasizing the importance of developing the Veterans and Military Services program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one actually has been here long enough to take it from a resource center to a program.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dillard hopes to be the one to change this.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the May 30, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Wang’s mother wanted cookies there to symbolize how much her daughter loved to bake, Pahl said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that Wang was so good at baking that her mother eventually stopped ordering from caterers and just let her daughter bake for her events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The students who did speak about Wang shared what a positive person she was. For one student, Wang’s enthusiasm was the most contagious thing he said he had ever experienced.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another of Wang’s friends, who is a photographer, remembered that she used to ask why he always wanted to take pictures of her when they were at an event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wherever she was, “she made it that much more fun,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pahl said it was hard to talk about Wang but said she was a “great person who I made a lot of memories with.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two would spend countless hours talking about anything and everything after general meetings at the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity, Pahl said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The most amazing thing about Annie is that she was very well spoken and very articulate about what she said,” Pahl said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pahl said one night he went to drop off Wang, but the two found themselves talking through the night instead. While the two were chatting, Pahl accidentally left the emergency lights on his car on. By the time he went to his car, the battery was dead. While he waited for help, Wang was there to keep him company, talking with him for nearly another hour.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other friends shared stories of Wang always putting others before herself and being there for everyone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashley Roy, a fourth-year student at UCSB, also recalled one of her favorite memories of Wang. The two met because Wang would study at San Rafael Residence Hall, where Roy lived, even though Wang was a resident of Manzanita Village. Because of this, Wang would routinely lock herself out late at night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roy said she would usually be up late as well and would always let Wang back in the hall. Roy once asked Wang why she would always go out late at night, despite knowing she had no way back in the dorm.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The best time to see a shooting star is to go outside at midnight and look straight up at the sky,” Wang responded. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One night, Roy took Wang’s advice. Though it took a few days, she finally saw her first shooting star.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To me, Annie was a light,” Roy said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Auriemma improved to 9-0 in title games, just behind the legendary John Wooden, who went 10-0.</p>\n<p>More importantly in the women’s basketball world, however, UConn proved itself the most successful team in women’s basketball history, breaking the tie with Tennessee by winning an unprecedented ninth national championship.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Huskies without hesitation, are the most successful team in women’s basketball history. Yet, despite Auriemma’s incredible reign at the helm of UConn women’s basketball, he has yet to take the throne as the best ever coach in women’s basketball.</p>\n<p>And he never will because of a woman’s legacy who changed the course of women’s basketball forever and even more broadly, changed the way people think about women. That woman, of course, is Pat Summitt.</p>\n<p>Before Summitt, women weren’t considered competitors, nevertheless athletes. Today, people take women’s sports seriously, which wasn’t the case before her. Women’s equality in sports has a long way to go, but even if you don’t watch the Final Four, you see women’s basketball as a sport.</p>\n<p>She coached before and after Title IX, making $8,900 a year when she started at a school that wasn’t on the map in the basketball world. Summitt drove the bus and did the team laundry. The NCAA didn’t even recognize women’s basketball as an officially-sanctioned sport when Summitt took the head coaching job.</p>\n<p>As a young coach, Summitt rooted her team in defense. Today, defense is one of the biggest focuses in the women’s game. To say Summitt didn’t play a part of that would be ignorant.</p>\n<p>From a popularity standpoint, Summitt put people in the stands to watch females play. In fact, more people headed to the Lady Vols’ games than a game for the men’s team. Her team earned more exposure than the men too. If modern women’s sports had to say thank you to someone, Pat Summitt would be one of the people at the top of that list.</p>\n<p>Women in all sports owe something to Summitt. Without her, there’s no path for Auriemma.</p>\n<p>When Summitt stepped down in 2012, announcing early onset dementia as the cause, women’s basketball lost what Wooden called “the best coach in NCAA basketball history.”</p>\n<p>Honestly, any writer could write a book simply on her accomplishments alone. In her 38 years as head coach of the Lady Vols, Summitt compiled 1,098 wins, the most in NCAA history in any sport male or female. Of the 161 athletes she coached, 94 are current coaches and 12 went on to become Olympians. And if that’s not enough for you, with her eight NCAA championships, she was named the Naismith Coach of the Century.</p>\n<p>As a result, Summitt is argued by many to be the greatest college basketball coach of all time, and one of the best in any sport.</p>\n<p>In a world where women were seen as inferior, she coached her athletes like men. There was no daintiness in practice, running them out of the gym. Those blue eyes could be daggers, but she always got the best out her athletes.</p>\n<p>She created fantastic players, but worked even harder to make them good people, earning a 100 percent graduation rate. Summitt is a class act and it’s earned her respect nationwide. Ever since the diagnosis announcement, “We Back Pat” shirts have been seen on college campus all over the U.S.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that no matter what happens in the future, the women’s sports will owe great appreciation to Summitt. There’s a statue outside Tennessee’s gym of her and the court is named after her, all for a reason.</p>\n<p>No one person has done more for one sport than Summitt and that’s something championships don’t show.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of npr.org</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54801\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-10/the-everlasting-legacy-of-pat-summitt/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54801\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-10/the-everlasting-legacy-of-pat-summitt/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-10/the-everlasting-legacy-of-pat-summitt/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-10/the-everlasting-legacy-of-pat-summitt/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-10/the-everlasting-legacy-of-pat-summitt/","id":2051,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[2050,2049,2048],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
