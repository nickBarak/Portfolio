Many of the attendees’ concerns focused on how the Trump administration’s new and proposed policies would impact these issues.</p>\n<p>Carbajal addressed a student’s question regarding how he would combat the president’s budget cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency’s office of research and development. He said he would continue to “speak out” against harmful legislation.</p>\n<p>“The reality is that I am in the minority party right now, and one party controls both chambers of Congress and the White House,” Carbajal said. “So what we can do is put forth legislation, which oftentimes cannot move forward, and develop bipartisan support to bring it forward for a hearing to bring it to the floor.”</p>\n<p>Many students asked questions about issues affecting students, including food insecurity, tuition and loans.</p>\n<p>Carbajal said since Trump’s proposed budget cuts funding to programs that help combat students’ food insecurity, he has sponsored an appropriations bill request for more funding for food banks.</p>\n<p>Carbajal went on to address college tuition hikes and the advent of paying off student loans after graduation. The congressman, a UCSB alumnus, said he still has not paid off all his student loans.</p>\n<p>Carbajal said he has supported an appropriations bill to increase the Pell Grant and make access to the grant year round. He also said he wants to work on lowering the interest rates attached to student loans.</p>\n<p>“The interest rates … are really high, and I think we need to stop the profiteering by certain financial institutions on the backs of students trying to get a college education,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>Carbajal addressed the issue of immigration last, sharing that his father immigrated to the United States from Mexico back “when immigration worked.”</p>\n<p>He said the immigration system no longer works and needs comprehensive reform and the creation of a clear path to citizenship.</p>\n<p>Carbajal said it is challenging to introduce Democratic legislation in the current Congress because oftentimes Republicans block the legislation from moving forward to the floor.</p>\n<p>He said, however, that constituents still can influence policies when they vocalize their concerns, noting the way the Republicans failed to pass their alternative to the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>“I remind you that when you believe in these issues and sometimes feel a little powerless and you question whether your advocacy … works, look what happened with the Affordable Care Act,” he said. “That happened because people spoke up.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

So I put all my stickers on.”</p>\n<p>So began the team that would go on to win first place at Startup Weekend, a two-day program on the weekend of Jan. 15-17 in which students launched entrepreneurial projects from scratch.</p>\n<p>Orisun was one of a handful of products to make it to the finals on Sunday, Jan. 17. One team proposed an app called Open, which allows users to keep track of drunk friends. Another group proposed Physique, an app in which users do workouts based on how they want to look.</p>\n<p>The fitness app won third place and Open won second, but the Orisun team placed above the rest because they built a functional prototype on the day of presentation.</p>\n<p>The team developed a simple product: Orisun is a foldable solar reflector able to melt snow on backpacking trips. Users can fold the device into a large cup, and when deployed, Orisun unravels to three-and-a-half feet in diameter. Light rays from the sun hit the shiny Mylar surface, which directs them into a central column for users to heat up water, snow or food.</p>\n<p>Salazar created the circular origami figure made of paper and Mylar on the morning of Sunday, Jan. 17 — the same day the team intended to present. When demonstrated, the Orisun prototype was able to heat up water by one degree every two seconds.</p>\n<p>Judges also commended the Orisun team for making presales and meeting with representatives from REI, Patagonia and National Geographic.</p>\n<p>“We validated our market research maybe a little bit better than others because we actually got money and funding,” Sato said. “That’s one of the best ways to gauge whether people are really going to buy this.”</p>\n<p>She said the team’s competitor sells its product for about $80 to $120, but Orisun can have a market price of $45 to $60. Now, the target market price is somewhere under $100.</p>\n<p>“We have a cheaper solution that has potentially more applications,” she said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75229\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75229\" data-attachment-id=\"75229\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/solar-origami-takes-first-at-startup-competition/startup-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Startup 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75229\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=800%2C600\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-75229\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Robert Salazar</em></p></div>\n<p>According to the Orisun team, the applications for their product are broad. It serves a recreational purpose, able to assist a lifestyle of backpacking and trekking. Sailors can use Orisun to heat up ocean water for desalination.</p>\n<p>Team member Srikanth Kalluri, a third-year physics major, said he joined the team because he saw the application of Orisun as an assistance to third-world countries. He sees the solar cooker as a means of separating pollutants from water.</p>\n<p>There is still much more work ahead for Orisun. The team wants to build a final model that is “hiking worthy,” according to Kalluri.</p>\n<p>“Just because we pitched something at a local event doesn’t mean it’s finalized,” he said.</p>\n<p>Sato said they need to secure manufacturing for the product and talk to potential partners, an opportunity that has been opened up from the networking done at Startup Weekend.</p>\n<p>For teammate Evan Blasband, a second-year electrical engineering major, winning first place at Startup Weekend is “like a dream come true.”</p>\n<p>“You always hear stories about people starting a business when they’re in college,” he said. “I’ve been wanting to do this stuff for like 10 or 15 years now.”</p>\n<p>Salazar likens the art of origami to our relationship with our environment. The various parts of an origami bird — the beak and the wings — are interdependent and proportionate to one another, and any one small change to any of these features affects all others.</p>\n<p>“What I’d like my origami work to show is that, despite all of this interdependence, you can still create remarkable things, even with something as simple as a sheet of paper,” he said. “Imagine what we could create with our physical world if we follow these principles of interdependence.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Srikanth Kalluri is a third-year student, not a second-year. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75242\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/solar-origami-takes-first-at-startup-competition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75242\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/solar-origami-takes-first-at-startup-competition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/solar-origami-takes-first-at-startup-competition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/solar-origami-takes-first-at-startup-competition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/solar-origami-takes-first-at-startup-competition/","id":2717,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2716,2715,2714],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Professor Gives Speech at Women’s March on Washington","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-01-29-at-1.05.21-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-shot-2017-01-29-at-1.05.21-PM.png?resize=731%2C449&ssl=1","description":"UC Santa Barbara professor Aída Hurtado was set to speak among high profile guests like Scarlett Johansson and Angela Davis.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the tight confines of a small airline cabin, a diverse group of women were able to find unity and strength among themselves as they traveled to the nation’s capital for the Women’s March on Washington last Saturday. Aída Hurtado’s seat was between two women who used all of their frequent flier miles and took extraordinary measures to make it to the protest.</p>\n<p>Hurtado said her job as an academic was to be present that day, but “here was a plane full of individual citizens with no support or structures to ensure their participation in the March; they were simply answering the call of what they thought was right and moral.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the five-hour flight, Hurtado and the two women she met on board confided in each other about the political and social consequences women would face from the new presidential administration.</p>\n<p>Organizers of the march put together a panel of over 40 celebrities and activists including Angela Davis and Scarlett Johansson to speak against President Trump’s administration and his rhetoric toward women and marginalized communities. UC Santa Barbara professor Aída Hurtado was set to speak among those high profile speakers.</p>\n<p>As the department chair of Chicano and Chicana studies, Hurtado’s work has focused primarily on gender equality and Chicana feminism. For her, the Women’s March had a clear purpose: women are not going to give back their rights and they will not stand down.</p>\n<p>She was invited to speak at the march by organizer Carmen Perez, who studied under Hurtado in the early 2000s at UC Santa Cruz. Perez became her research assistant after taking Hurtado’s undergraduate course in Chicana feminism.</p>\n<p>Hurtado said feminism and criminal justice have molded most of Perez’s career. Perez is the executive director of the nonprofit Gathering for Justice, founded by Harry Belafonte.</p>\n<p>In the midst of so many high status speeches and the 470,000 people that were marching, Hurtado did not think there would be time for her to speak. She thought that if unscheduled guests like Madonna had not gone up to speak at that point, then she wouldn’t either.</p>\n<p>The program was running behind so she decided to put away her typed speech and enjoy the moment. Taking in the grandeur of that day was important to her, she said. She was watching her former student navigate a historic movement.</p>\n<p>A few moments later, Perez texted Hurtado and told her not to leave the stage because she was going up after Madonna.</p>\n<p>Her original speech was going to be about the incredible “feminist victories” throughout history: obtaining the right to vote, abortion and contraceptive rights and sexual harassment legislation were just some of the topics that Hurtado was going to mention. She found it necessary to highlight women’s “efficacy and resilience.”</p>\n<p>But, when she approached the podium, she chose not to give that speech. Instead she spoke on Perez’s accomplishments. Hurtado said, if it were not for public education, which is under potential threat by the new presidential administration, Perez would not be here today to organize the momentous demonstration.</p>\n<p>Hurtado expressed the significance the UC system has in the world as a public institution. “We are one of the biggest public university systems in the world,” she said, “and there is a risk that it could be privatized.”</p>\n<p>Hurtado was referring to President Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Education, Elizabeth “Betsy” DeVos. DeVos has a history of being tied to the privatization of education. According to The Atlantic, DeVos’s family poured $1.45 million into preventing Michigan from adding oversight for charter schools.</p>\n<p>The racial divide in the country was also a concern to Hurtado. To her, it is homogenizing to say that white women were the only ones at the march when the participants were diverse in age, gender and race.</p>\n<p>According to Hurtado, the media was expecting a strategic formula to what the march itself achieved. But she doesn’t believe social change is that simple. It isn’t effective to expect a simple equation to define how social change works, she said.</p>\n<p>Hurtado wants the focus on the fact that individual citizens showed up and said “not in my name; you are not going to do this to us.”</p>\n<p>According to Al Jazeera’s Trump Tracker, within the first five days of Trump’s presidency he has already passed a bill with the support of the House to stop federal funding for abortion and block tax credits for individuals and businesses buying abortion coverage under federal health care law. The anti-abortion bill was originally enacted during the Reagan administration and has since been revived by every Republican president after him and subsequently dismantled by every Democratic president.</p>\n<p>The “dismantling” that the administration is doing instead of “building” is her main concern. She said she doesn’t think we should have a “list” of demands just yet when there are so many executive orders being made to take away more of citizens’ rights.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know what’s going to happen, but what did happen was magical,” she said. “I want to sit on that for a while.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily

Theater. Photo: The Varsity Bike Shop in 1997 <em>via La Cumbre archives</em></p></div>\n<p>One could hardly paint an accurate portrait of the UC Santa Barbara campus without including a few key details: hundreds of bikes lined side-by-side outside lecture halls, thousands of bikes filed bumper-to-bumper en route to classes and, occasionally, two bikes locked together when there is no space on the bike racks.</p>\n<p>George Misbeek, one of the founders of Varsity Bike Shop on Pardall Road, has provided service to UCSB’s bike-savvy students for over 50 years, and he has seen generations walk in and out of his doors.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had so many customers — moms and dads who’d come in with their kids to buy bikes,” Misbeek said. “After several years, the children would come back to buy bikes for their kids.”</p>\n<p>Although Misbeek has seen a large chunk of UCSB bike history, the use of bikes on campus and in Isla Vista dates back decades before his time. It wasn’t until a series of “bike booms” in the 1960s and 1970s, however, that necessity for the human-powered vehicle came to physically shape the campus itself.</p>\n<p>Local historian Britta Gustafson said her impression is that bikes have always been part of Isla Vista, a small neighborhood that underwent development as early as 1925. With no running water or paved roads, I.V. “wasn’t a fancy place,” she said, and was home to many low-income families.</p>\n<p>Bicycles were cheap and popular, “like in any semi-rural beachside community with scattered houses and a bunch of kids,” Gustafson said.</p>\n<p>According to Dennis Whelan, associate campus architect, members of the United States Navy probably used bicycles between 1941 and 1944 when there was a U.S. Marine Corps base in place of the university.</p>\n<p>UCSB later moved into the former Marine base buildings, he said, and cyclists would ride on roadways and walkways or they would create their own dirt paths in what were “the very early and dusty days of campus.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72190\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72190\" data-attachment-id=\"72190\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/bikes-gauchos-ride-or-die/1-6-2013-first-day-of-winter-quarter-peter-vandenbelt-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4.jpg?fit=1600%2C966&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,966\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"1.6.2013 First day of Winter Quarter   Peter Vandenbelt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4.jpg?fit=250%2C151&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4.jpg?fit=888%2C536&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-72190\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4-1024x618.jpg?resize=888%2C536\" alt=\"1.6.2013 First day of Winter Quarter / Peter Vandenbelt / Nexus File Photo\" width=\"888\" height=\"536\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C618&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4.jpg?resize=250%2C151&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4.jpg?resize=768%2C464&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72190\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nexus file photo</p></div>\n<p>There was a particular “cycle boom” amongst UCSB students in the 1960s, as noted by a 1964 headline in El Gaucho (a predecessor to the Nexus). The story reported 23 accidents and 659 bike thefts in the 1963-1964 school year, events that campus police considered a “major problem” to address the following school year.</p>\n<p>Misbeek took advantage of this “cycle boom” when he and two other friends started Varsity Bike Shop on Sept. 18, 1964, a date he quickly recalls today.</p>\n<p>The founder, now 87 years old, said bikes were well in use by the time he had set up shop in a building where “they hadn’t even got all the walls in yet.” He and his co-owners were “optimistic” of the store’s future; they anticipated continuing growth for the university, both in enrollment numbers and in the physical size of the campus.</p>\n<p>Some might say the optimism was well-founded. These were the years, after all, when the largest-ever generation at the time — the baby boomers — started their postsecondary education. A UCSB Planning data book indicates 4,865 students enrolled in the 1962 Fall Quarter, which increased to 5,938 students in the 1963 Fall Quarter and 7,879 students a year after that.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the campus underwent rapid expansion in size. According to Whelan, university developers completed six buildings in 1966 alone: the Engineering building, the Chemistry building, the University Center (UCen), Carrillo dining commons, Buchanan Hall and Phelps Hall.</p>\n<p>With a larger campus than ever before, Misbeek said walking to class quickly became inconvenient. Biking, he said, was increasingly necessary for students to arrive to class on time.</p>\n<p>Varsity Bike Shop could hardly keep up with demand. Misbeek remembers opening at 6 a.m. and working nonstop until as late as 2 a.m.</p>\n<p>He would buy several large containers of 350 bikes, “all of them black three-speeds.” It would only take about six weeks, he said, to sell an entire container of bikes, each priced from $39 to $49 in 1964. Three to four years later, the same bikes were selling at $70 to $80.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72185\" style=\"width: 725px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72185\" data-attachment-id=\"72185\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/bikes-gauchos-ride-or-die/bikes-from-la-cumbre-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bikes-from-LA-CUMBRE-4.jpg?fit=1397%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1397,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bikes from LA CUMBRE-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bikes-from-LA-CUMBRE-4.jpg?fit=175%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bikes-from-LA-CUMBRE-4.jpg?fit=715%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-72185\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bikes-from-LA-CUMBRE-4-715x1024.jpg?resize=715%2C1024\" alt=\"Cielo Calderon / La Cumbre 1997\" width=\"715\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bikes-from-LA-CUMBRE-4.jpg?resize=715%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 715w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bikes-from-LA-CUMBRE-4.jpg?resize=175%2C250&amp;ssl=1 175w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bikes-from-LA-CUMBRE-4.jpg?resize=768%2C1099&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bikes-from-LA-CUMBRE-4.jpg?w=1397&amp;ssl=1 1397w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72185\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">El Gaucho archives</p></div>\n<p>Before building its first bike paths in the late 1960s, the university only had walkways going through campus. Bikers rode on the sides of the walkways, where cyclists were supposed to be as indicated in a “set of regulations” posted in a 1963 El Gaucho article.</p>\n<p>The university developed the first stretch of bike path in August 1966, which provided travel along El Colegio Road between Francisco Torres (now San Clemente residence hall) and the campus pool. It was a “class one” bike path — a lane exclusively for bikes on the side of a shared road — and may have been the very first of its kind for Santa Barbara County, according to Whelan.</p>\n<p>“You can see a remnant on the west side of the track, opposite Student Health,” Whelan said in an email. “It is much-degraded asphalt now that appears to be a walkway.”</p>\n<p>The university continued to develop its bike system throughout much of the 1960s and 1970s as enrollment numbers grew and capital funds became available for the building of underpasses and bike circles.</p>\n<p>Of the several paths following the first, developers created a “central bikeway” in 1969 that ran east-west from the Student Health underpass to Kerr Hall. It was in 1970 that the university developed its iconic bike path, the Arts Mall Bikeway, running from Pardall tunnel to the Arts building.</p>\n<p>The campus bike system became especially necessary in the 1970s, a decade in which biking became even more popular than the one before.</p>\n<p>A Time magazine article, published in June 1971, reported on a national shortage of bicycles as the result of the “bicycle’s biggest wave of popularity in its 154-year history.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72189\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"704828842\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72291\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72189\" data-attachment-id=\"72189\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/bikes-gauchos-ride-or-die/bike_lorenzo-basilio-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?fit=2000%2C1111&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1111\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?fit=250%2C139&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?fit=888%2C493&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-72189 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?resize=888%2C493\" alt=\"Nexus file photo\" width=\"888\" height=\"493\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?resize=250%2C139&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?resize=768%2C427&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?resize=1024%2C569&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72189\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nexus file photo</p></div>\n<p>The article notes that bicycles were seen as a solution for many groups of the time. Environmentalists chose them as a non-pollutant alternative to cars.</p>\n<p>“Physical-fitness fans” saw the bike as a “heart preserver.” Workers in “traffic-choked cities” would begin commuting on bicycles to beat rush-hour traffic.<br>\nUCSB was certainly not left out of the nationwide bicycle movement.</p>\n<p>Former California State Senator James Mills once made an 11-day bike trip from San Francisco to San Diego in September 1972 to campaign for Proposition 20, which eventually passed and formed the California Coastal Commission. One of the overnight stops for him and his group of cyclists was the Devereux House on UCSB’s west campus.</p>\n<p>As the 1970s progressed, the university added several stretches of bike path to its existing system. Among many other projects, the university built the segment between UCen Road and the Arbor in 1973 and the path from the Arbor to the south side of the library in 1977.</p>\n<p>In 1978, developers completed one of the final additions to the campus bike system: the bike circle next to Storke Tower. This is the same bike circle in which, during the opening week of fall classes, some students set up lawn chairs to watch new cyclists timidly navigate through the roundabout for the first time, hoping to see a crash.</p>\n<p>Today, UCSB has approximately seven miles of dedicated bike path, enough to provide travel for thousands of students, faculty and staff every day. For every year since 2011, the League of American Bicyclists has given UCSB “gold level” designation on its list of “bike friendly universities.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, bikes are so historically well received on campus, it makes sense that the bike racks are nearly always full. As reminisced in his song “Do You Remember,” such is the dilemma UCSB alumnus Jack Johnson ran into when he was “late for class” and could find no room to park his bike outside I.V. Theater. He saw the bike of a girl he met in Ortega dining commons (not the DLG as one might assume from “Bubble Toes”), the one with the “painted flowers on it,” and locked his to hers instead.</p>\n<p>But UCSB’s busy bike culture isn’t necessarily a bad thing; it won Jack Johnson a lunch date with the woman who would later become his wife.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, August 25, 2016 print issue of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72291\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/bikes-gauchos-ride-or-die/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72291\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/bikes-gauchos-ride-or-die/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/bikes-gauchos-ride-or-die/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/bikes-gauchos-ride-or-die/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/bikes-gauchos-ride-or-die/","id":2716,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2715,2714,2713],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
