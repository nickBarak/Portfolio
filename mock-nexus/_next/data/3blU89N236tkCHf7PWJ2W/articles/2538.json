Amputation is a fairly common event in response to meningococcal infections.”</p>\n<p>Shane Yen, second-year pre-biology major and one of many students waiting in line to get a vaccination last Friday at the Health Center, said he was looking forward to receiving the vaccination.</p>\n<p>“I usually don’t look forward to getting shots,” Yen said. “But when you’ve got a deadly infection like meningitis, which could potentially kill you, I’m actually really eager to get this shot. It’s better to be safe than sorry.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Robinson provided tips for students to stay safe and prevent catching the disease and encouraged students to get the vaccine as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>“The most important way to prevent this infection is to get the vaccine — that’s number one,” Robinson said. “Other than that, avoid people who are sick, try not to share secretions and be aware in overcrowded situations.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Robinson said the disease is contracted in social settings, which makes it especially important for college students to get the vaccine.</p>\n<p>“In times when there are outbreaks, visiting bars, drinking alcohol and smoking are also risk factors for catching it,” Robinson said. “But by far, the most important thing is to get the vaccine.”</p>\n<p>According to Dr. Robinson, the vaccine’s most common side effect is soreness at the injection site. Others can include fever, headaches and rare muscle aches, but these conditions are “a whole lot better than losing your life.”</p>\n<p>“The saddest thing as an infectious disease specialist is to see a young, intelligent, perfectly healthy student die or become maimed from this infection, when I know that it is preventable with a simple shot,” Dr. Robinson said.</p><div

A UCPD officer at the scene said the minor blaze was likely caused by “a careless smoker.”</p>\n<p>Cabe Fletcher, building and resource manager for the Chemistry Building, said “people were using [the steps] as an ashtray.”</p>\n<p>When Shelor was pouring water on the fire, he said a whole pile of “cigarette butts were burning” on the steps.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully, this puts it over the top for no smoking,” said Shelor, who asked that students refrain from smoking on campus.</p>\n<p>No injuries were reported in the minor fire.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Although they organize fundraisers year-round, the 12-hour Dance Marathon event is the organization’s largest and most well-known event. The annual fundraiser invites UCSB students to perform and seeks donations from participants and the community. This year’s event raised approximately $16,000, which was substantially less than last year’s total of $35,000.</p>\n<p>Sueleme Ceballos, Dance Marathon Director of Entertainment and fourth-year political science major, said the organization originally hoped this year’s event would exceed last year’s donations.</p>\n<p>“The goal this time was $50,000 — we were hoping that it got there,” Ceballos said. “We were hoping to get it up there, hopefully higher every year. We want to set a good precedent for our future Dance Marathons, because the event is still new to UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Despite not reaching its monetary goal, Dance Marathon maintained a positive outlook, Executive Director and fourth-year biology Lynn Padlipsky said.</p>\n<p>“I was extremely thrilled about how the morale stayed positive the entire time. Everyone danced the entire time, everyone was happy,” Padlipsky said. “Do I wish the numbers were higher? Yes. But that’s okay. The morale was high this year.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68466\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68466\" data-attachment-id=\"68466\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/dance-marathon-raises-money-for-childrens-hosptial/the-amount-raised/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dance Marathon 2016\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68466\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1-1024x678.jpg?resize=800%2C530\" alt=\"Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus\" width=\"800\" height=\"530\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68466\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Sammy Gerraty Dance Marathon Intern of Operations and second-year dance and pre-bio double major, the spirit of the donors and volunteers made the event a success.</p>\n<p>“Even though we didn’t have as many dancers as last year and even though the numerical amount may not have been as much, the spirit in the room and the genuine care for the kids is what made people stay,” Gerraty said. “Last year people were coming to [get] volunteer hours, and that’s the wrong reason to come.
