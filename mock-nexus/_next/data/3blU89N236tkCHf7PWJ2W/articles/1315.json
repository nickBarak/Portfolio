While it may not have been the result the Gauchos were looking for, there were many positives to take away from the game, including the team’s resiliency despite being down a goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara started the game off strong as senior forward Shaelan Murison found the back of the net two minutes into the game. Murison continues to be a nightmare for opposing teams as she is constantly putting pressure on goal. This not only forces teams to play more defensive but also allows UCSB to play more freely in the midfield area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it is early, one thing that has been noticeable is the aggressive press that the Gauchos have played with. By constantly pressuring the ball, it makes it more likely for their opponents to turn the ball over, especially in their own half of the field.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the first ten minutes being dominated by Santa Barbara, Minnesota began to find their rhythm behind strong play from junior forward Makenzie Langdok. Langdok had her first shot blocked in the 19th minute but was able to put away a goal in the 18th minute to the level the matchup at 1-1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite a quick start, UCSB was unable to keep their momentum primarily because they were constantly being called for fouls. This ended up stagnating their counterattack and allowing Minnesota to increase their time of possession.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Langdok took advantage and scored her second goal of the match in the 57th minute behind a lazy pass in the back end by the ‘Chos. Minnesota had seemingly taken full control of the game at this point and shifted toward a defensive formation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB responded by putting constant pressure on the Golden Gopher’s goalkeeper Maddie Nielsen. Nielsen successfully blocked two Gaucho attempts but was unsuccessful in the 83rd minute as sophomore forward Jessica Wright pushed the ball through to knot things up. Neither team would be able to create many chances following this goal in either overtime, leading to the final score of 2-2.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was an encouraging sight for Head Coach Paul Stumpf as it is clear that this squad not only competes at a high level but also has the maturity to not panic when things are not going their way. There were a couple instances where this was clear but one in particular was when the ‘Chos were constantly being called for fouls throughout the first half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than allow this to take themselves out of the game mentally, Santa Barbara was able to keep their composure, a characteristic that will be necessary to maintain for UCSB to make a run for the Big West Title.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up for UCSB will be a matchup against San Jose State, who are also coming off of a draw against Cal Poly. The Spartans are led by Jamilecxth Becerra who finished last season with a team-leading five goals. For the Gauchos to have success in this matchup, it will be important that the defense shadows Becerra as she is extremely dangerous in the penalty box area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In front of goal for the Spartans is sophomore Ariana Romero who recently transferred from Seattle University. In her first start for SJSU, Romero had an impressive three saves which helped lead to a clean sheet. UCSB will need to constantly put pressure on goal in their upcoming matchup to take Romero out of her comfort zone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara will look to get their first win of the season at home this Sunday against SJSU at 12 p.m. inside Harder Stadium. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

of their run this past year as they begin their quest for the 2019-20 Big West title.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos finished the 2018-19 season in second place in the Big West with a 4-2-1 conference, 10-6-2 overall record. They both started and ended the season on a three-game win streak, yet close losses in the middle would come back to bite them as they ended just one game out of first place, and with a tough first-round matchup in the conference tournament against Cal State Fullerton. For the second year in a row, UCSB would go on to lose their first game of the tourney at home, this time a missed penalty kick away from advancing.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking ahead, the Gauchos do have plenty to be optimistic about. One of the keys to success in any college sport is continuity, and the Gauchos are returning with a strong core including players such as senior defender Faouzi Taieb, senior midfielder Thibault Candia, and junior forward Rodney Michael. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taieb has been a key component in the Gauchos’ defensive and offensive gameplans ever since he transferred from St. Francis Brooklyn a year ago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He tallied the most minutes on the team last year with 1642, and started every match he played. The French defender plays such a huge role because of his ability to not just orchestrate the defense, but also because of his nose for the ball on set-pieces. Whether it be his game-winning tap-in last year against Gonzaga, or his header in UCSB’s exhibition win over Westmont last weekend, Taieb’s physical strength and knack for being in the right place at the right time makes him one of the most dangerous players on the field when it’s time for a free kick. His production has made it possible for UCSB to almost depend on set-pieces as the primary form of goal-scoring however, which is an issue I’ll get back to a little later on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving to the middle of the field, fellow transfer Candia has developed into one of the top playmakers in the entire conference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candia’s seven assists led the Big West last year and he has the sole assist of this season for the Gauchos in their win against the Warriors. The Parisian midfielder has been a mastermind on offense for UCSB, earning a Big West Player of the Week award last season and notching a game-winning goal against UC Davis as well. He’s usually all over the attacking third, mixing curled long balls with quick through passes that keep the defense on their feet. He is also the free-kick taker for the Gauchos, who as I mentioned before are one of if not the most lethal teams in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, star forward Michael has re-energized and added a new dimension to UCSB’s offense. While his accolades (2018 All-Big West First Team, 2018 All-Far West Region Team, and 2017 Big West Freshman of the Year, to name a few) speak for themselves, you really don’t understand just how quick and skilled Michael is until you see it with your own eyes. The junior commands a double team in almost every game, and still manages to burst through the backline and score, as evidenced by his team-leading 17 goals last season. The pressure he puts on defenses is unlike any other player in the conference, and he is the key piece that makes this team run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These three players are certainly invaluable to the Gauchos, but they’re not the only big names on the team. Reigning Co-Big West Freshman of the Year Ben Roach,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who is a wall of a goalkeeper; senior defender Noah Billingsley, who anchors the defense; and senior forward Sahid Conteh, who both playmakes and finishes at an elite level are just a few examples of other players who will be essential to success in the upcoming season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a team, the Gauchos will have to get over some of the hurdles that haunted them all of last season. As mentioned earlier, UCSB’s overreliance on set-pieces to produce goals extremely limited their goal-scoring ability. Far too often last year the team would get out into transition, or string together nice passes in the midfield for it to just fizzle out as they reached the attacking third. They lost four games by the score of 1-0 last season, which is unacceptable when putting out the amount of offensive talent that they do on the field. It also cheapens the impact of the amazing defense and goalkeeping that they consistently play night in and night out, and allows teams to stick around that they should beat handily.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will also have to make sure to maintain their composure as the season goes on. They received five yellow cards and a red already in their exhibition match against Westmont, and they just can’t afford to shoot themselves in the foot because of their temper. Finding that middle ground between playing with passion and losing control can be difficult, but the Gauchos will need to keep it cool in order to get far.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This next stretch of non-conference games, including matchups against big teams such as Virginia Tech, UC Berkeley and Gonzaga, will give UCSB a good opportunity to get back into playing shape and get some positive momentum going into the conference season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Big West play starts, the two Blue-Green Rivalry games against Cal Poly, which they play at Harder Stadium on Oct. 5 and Alex G. Spanos Stadium on Nov. 2, will of course be must-watch television. There is always no love lost between these two squads and they typically bring out the best in each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another game to circle on your calendar will be the Gauchos’ matchup with UC Irvine at home on Oct. 19. The reigning Big West Champion Anteaters are the only team in the conference to be voted into the Top 25 by the </span><a href=\"https://unitedsoccercoaches.org/rankings/college-rankings/ncaa-di-men/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">United Soccer Coaches Preseason Poll</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and will give UCSB a great opportunity to measure themselves against some of the top talent in the country.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

In Sunday’s game, the ‘Chos could not find the back of the net and ended up in a 0-0 draw against San Jose State at Harder Stadium. With this result, UCSB moves to 0-0-2 on the season and is still searching for its first win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Spartans’ start to the season has been similar to the Gauchos, as they tied 0-0 in their first regular season game against Cal Poly last Thursday. San Jose State has high expectations for this season after being picked to finish second in the Mountain West Conference Preseason Poll.

Last season the Spartans had one of the best defenses in the country, lead by now-senior Kristen Amarikwa, a 2018 All-Mountain West First Team selection. Her teammates Jada Wilson and Natasha Harris were selected to the All-Conference and All-MWC Tournament teams respectively last season, and they’re back to hold down the fort defensively. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunday’s game saw the Gauchos get off to a solid start that left them with nothing to show for it. During the first 31 minutes of action, UCSB managed four shots and limited the Spartans to zero attempts of their own. Angelica Ortega and Shaelan Murison both got decent looks, but Spartans keeper Ariana Romero came up with the save both times. Aside from the few shots from both teams, the first half set the gritty tone of this game with lots of physical play and a heft number of fouls called as both teams combined for 11 of the game’s 33 total fouls in the first 45 minutes of action.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the second half, Santa Barbara continued to get solid looks to score but again it was keeper Romero with another pair of saves in the first 18 minutes of the second half. SJSU did not get many great looks all game until the 81st minute, when the Spartans’ Darrian Reed and Natalia Nava got a couple of shots on goal within a two-minute span that were both saved by Gauchos keeper Hanna DeWeese. Each team had one more shot to win in regulation as shots by Murison of UCSB and Alison Gallant of SJSU were saved in the final minutes and the match went to overtime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neither team scored in overtime even though the Gauchos kept the pressure on and managed six unsuccessful shots in twenty minutes before the game was called. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This marathon overtime game gives the Gauchos a 0-0-2 record, and they will look to get their first win of the season at 5:00 p.m. on Friday

After a successful season last year in which the Gauchos finished with an overall record of 13-7-1, Head Coach Paul Stumpf will look to increase his team’s win total with an extremely well-rounded squad.</p>\n<p>UCSB got off to a quick start last year as they began the season on a five-game win streak. Of those five matchups, the ‘Chos were able to keep a clean sheet in three of them. This was a major trend throughout last season as the Gauchos did not give up more than three goals in any game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Much of this success can be attributed to senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese, who came off the bench against Cal early in the season to help lead Santa Barbara to the win. Gaucho fans can expect DeWeese to be a force in front of the goal who will make her opponents earn their goals. After finishing last year with 60 saves and a save percentage of 80%, there is a lot of excitement around her potential for this upcoming season.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side of the ball, UCSB will be led by senior forward Shaelan Murison, who was recently named to the Big West preseason All-Conference Team. Murison was fantastic last year as she finished with 10 goals and four assists. In order for Santa Barbara to improve offensively, it will be crucial for Murison to not only provide veteran leadership but also create opportunities for her teammates as well.</p>\n<p>Although Murison will be key to the offensive attack, she will surely be double-teamed which means that her teammates must step up as well. Senior forward Katherine Sheehy seems to be a player that could potentially have a breakout year and help ease the pressure off of Murison. Sheehy is a playmaker and will look to push the ball with pace on the counter attack to catch opponents in a poor position defensively.</p>\n<p>For UCSB to compete for the Big West Title, the squad will need to have more of a balanced attack on the offensive side of the field. Last season, Murison had a total of a 100 shots with her next closest teammate coming in with only 19 shots.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara to have a chance to compete against the top teams in the country, other players must step up as opposing teams will place all their attention on Murison. That being said, there is strong optimism within the program that players like Sheehy will provide production offensively to make the team even more dynamic.</p>\n<p>With respect to this year’s schedule, there is one matchup in particular that Gaucho fans should be excited about, which is a home game against the California Golden Bears on Aug. 30. In last year’s contest, UCSB won in a thriller by a score of 3-2 behind strong play from DeWeese. Cal will surely be out for revenge in this game, making it a very intriguing matchup.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has already started this season strong in terms of exhibition games as they beat Westmont by a score of 2-0. Murison was able to break through in the 26th minute and junior midfielder Angelica Ortega added on with a goal in the 40th minute. With this game in control fairly early, UCSB was able to play more of their younger players to get them real game experience, which could prove to be important later down the road.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to keep up their winning ways against Minnesota this upcoming Thursday at home in Harder Stadium at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89633\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/2019-20-season-preview-well-balanced-womens-soccer-team-aims-sights-on-the-big-west-title/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89633\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/2019-20-season-preview-well-balanced-womens-soccer-team-aims-sights-on-the-big-west-title/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/2019-20-season-preview-well-balanced-womens-soccer-team-aims-sights-on-the-big-west-title/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/2019-20-season-preview-well-balanced-womens-soccer-team-aims-sights-on-the-big-west-title/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/2019-20-season-preview-well-balanced-womens-soccer-team-aims-sights-on-the-big-west-title/","id":1313,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[1312,1311,1310],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
