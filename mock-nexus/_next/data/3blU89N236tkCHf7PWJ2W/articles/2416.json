I like George. I like Bob. I’m glad that those are the two people who are appointed. I just, I had a dream of a more separate district,” Freeman said. “The appointment process allows leniency for people who weren’t even in Isla Vista on the district, and we’re lucky to have people like Bob Geis who has been around here for a long, long time, but who knows what could happen.”</p>\n<p>As for the university’s role in I.V. through the CSD, Director Thurlow said Chancellor Yang is focused on improving the area.</p>\n<p>“He is incredibly interested in making Isla Vista better,” Thurlow said. “It’s a priority for him.”</p>\n<p>Thurlow said he plans to work, in the short term, on an internship program for UCSB students to work directly with the CSD.

She said Anthony Tsang saved up his allowance to buy her a stuffed animal panda that she wanted for her sixth birthday.</p>\n<p>“He remembered that I wanted it, and he went back to buy it for me,” she said. “So it’s just like little things that I didn’t really think about at the time but now when I go back, it just really matters to me.”</p>\n<p>Tiana Tsang also said her brother was incredibly selfless and always looking out for others.</p>\n<p>“After he passed away, a bunch of his friends came out with stories about him and a lot of things he did, I never knew about, and a lot of us never knew about, that showed how selfless he was,” she said.</p>\n<p>Michelle Lew, Tony’s fiancée, said they did everything together.</p>\n<p>“He was my best friend, the one I shared everything with,” Lew said. “Since the day we met, for two years, we only spent maybe a total of five nights apart.”</p>\n<p>Lew said Anthony could brighten anyone’s day and was able to connect with those around him through his diverse interests and cheerful personality.</p>\n<p>“He was really, for lack of a better word, goofy. He was always messing around, always the silly one, trying to make people laugh,” Lew said.</p>\n<p>Lew and Anthony Tsang lived in Santa Barbara together after meeting on Tinder in San Jose two years ago. They owned two Jack-Russell-Chihuahua mixes and enjoyed going to Arroyo Burro Beach together with their dogs.</p>\n<p>“The big thing that stuck out was how we met, because we actually met on Tinder. So that was a one-in-a-million thing,” Lew said. “The first thing that he messaged me was a pick up line, which was: ‘I’m looking for my next wife on Tinder.’”</p>\n<p>Lew said a year after they met, they were engaged and planned to marry after they finished college.</p>\n<p>“Everything just fit together by random chance,” Lew said.</p>\n<p>In high school, Anthony Tsang was on the cross country team with his friend, Jonathan Wyatt. The two were friends all throughout high school.</p>\n<p>Wyatt described Anthony Tsang as “curious and mischievous … but also extremely charismatic and caring for other people.”</p>\n<p>“It was quite an interesting combination … but it honestly made him a really fun person, and I enjoyed spending a lot of time with him,” Wyatt said.</p>\n<p>Wyatt said Anthony Tsang was always getting into trouble in high school and said once he and Anthony Tsang attempted to steal an old computer out of a shed on the high school campus.</p>\n<p>Wyatt said even though the scheme was his idea, Anthony Tsang took most of the blame after they were caught.</p>\n<p>“It was the most ridiculous thing ever, so funny,” Wyatt said. “And Tony was like, man, this always happens to me.” It was great, and honestly I’d give anything just to relive those days again.”</p>\n<p>Wyatt said Anthony Tsang’s other friends would describe him as “someone you could count on, no matter what it was.”</p>\n<p>“I think the fact that we could always count on him really was like one of the bigger takeaways from his personality because no matter what situation you were in … he wasn’t really one to judge people,” Wyatt said.</p>\n<p>Wyatt also said he admired Anthony Tsang’s adventurous personality, which made a “huge impact” on his own high school experience.</p>\n<p>“He never really had a stop button. It was always go go go,” Wyatt said. “It was very different from how most people live their life, I feel.”</p>\n<p>Tiana Tsang said her brother wanted to be a U.S. ambassador to Mexico because he “really loved it.”</p>\n<p>He traveled to Mexico on vacation multiple times with Lew, and Anthony Tsang said he loved how “nice” and “chill” everyone was there.</p>\n<p>According to Lew, Anthony Tsang was a “big beer enthusiast,” which she said might have contributed to his love of Mexico.</p>\n<p>“He liked … just how everyone is so easygoing,” Lew said. “He liked just sitting on the beach and going in the ocean. He liked how friendly everyone was, just something about Mexico’s culture … he was comfortable there.”</p>\n<p>Lew and her fiancé traveled to Canada, Las Vegas and Mexico together. They planned to visit Hawaii and backpack through Europe.</p>\n<p>Anthony Tsang enjoyed listening to EDM, country and indie rock music and was a Dallas basketball and football fan. He liked to draw and snowboard and loved cars, especially Porsches.</p>\n<p>“A couple weeks ago, we went to Porsche, and he was super excited because he got to test drive one,” Lew said. “We went back two days later for me to test drive cars, but then he test drove it again.”</p>\n<p>Tiana Tsang said her brother was always willing to try new things and lived a carefree life.</p>\n<p>“He always wanted to experience life as much as possible, and I know it sounds really cheesy, but that’s honestly just the kind of person he was,” Tiana Tsang said. “And one thing that I really say is that, like, he really lived more life in his 23 years than some people do in their whole entire lives.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, March 2, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76129\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-loses-goofy-caring-student/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76129\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-loses-goofy-caring-student/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-loses-goofy-caring-student/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-loses-goofy-caring-student/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-loses-goofy-caring-student/","id":2414,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2413,2412,2411],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Documents Show 6 UCSB Employees Violated Title IX Policy","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-02-at-11.22.24-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-02-at-11.22.24-AM.png?resize=900%2C432&ssl=1","description":"The documents identify approximately 124 Title IX violations across the UC system between Jan. 1, 2013, and April 6, 2016.

Four of six cases at UCSB were reported by students, and the remaining were reported by UC staff.</p>\n<p>The only full-time professor named in UCSB documents was Gurinder Singh Mann, a professor of global studies.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office received a complaint in May 2013 from a female student alleging that Mann acted inappropriately with sexual conduct, both verbal and physical, during a research discussion meeting at Mann’s home.</p>\n<p>Mann retired in 2015 but was a professor at the time of the investigation, which began in May 2013.</p>\n<p>According to the documents, the female complainant said Mann asked her to sit on his bed with him and proceeded to lay beside her. While sitting on the bed, Mann allegedly touched her neck and chest around the area of her collarbone.</p>\n<p>She said he inserted his hand inside her shirt, touched her stomach and put his face near to hers. When she confronted him, he responded that “he’s not a dirty old man, that, for him, what he had done was just like petting his cat.”</p>\n<p>The student later wrote an email to Mann saying, “this really was extremely uncomfortable for me, I still have nightmares about it.” She also alleged that Mann, on several occasions, would rub her arm, shoulder and thigh.</p>\n<p>In the Title IX report, Mann denied all allegations of harassment and said his primary aim was establishing a Santa Barbara school of Sikh studies, not “playing with young people in any way.”</p>\n<p>Following an investigation, the Title IX office concluded in August 2013 that all such claims “more likely than not did occur” and that Mann had violated the UC’s sexual harassment policy.</p>\n<p>The documents do not indicate actions taken by the university, and Mann has since been a guest lecturer at UCSB after his retirement.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office received a report in May 2014 claiming that former music department lecturer Paul Sahuc allegedly sexually harassed a former music department graduate student.</p>\n<p>The female subject claimed that Sahuc had said on multiple occasions, “Are you on your period?” during lessons. She also stated that he repeatedly walked into the women’s dressing room unannounced while people were changing.</p>\n<p>According to the documents, several other witnesses offered information illustrating patterns of sexualized comments from Sahuc.</p>\n<p>Following an investigation, the UCSB Title IX office concluded that the alleged conduct “more likely than not did occur,” and that both allegations violated sexual harassment policy.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76156\" style=\"width: 475px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76156\" data-attachment-id=\"76156\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/documents-show-6-ucsb-employees-violated-title-ix-policy/screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2-27-10-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?fit=465%2C531&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"465,531\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen shot 2017-03-02 at 2.27.10 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?fit=219%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?fit=465%2C531&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76156\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?resize=465%2C531\" alt=\"\" width=\"465\" height=\"531\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?w=465&amp;ssl=1 465w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?resize=219%2C250&amp;ssl=1 219w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76156\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>As a result, the music department declined to renew Sahuc’s employment contract, effectively terminating his university employment.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office also received a report in April 2013 alleging that Facilities Management laborer Cresenciano Marin sexually harassed a senior custodian.</p>\n<p>The female subject had previously complained to her supervisors about Marin’s conduct, but she received no resolution. A formal investigation began in April 2013.</p>\n<p>As detailed in the documents, the complainant said while riding in an elevator together during their shift, Marin came up behind her as she bent down and put his hand on her back without her consent and made gestures “as to mock a sexual position.” After she told him he was being inappropriate, he responded that he would find her later and “violate/rape” her.</p>\n<p>The complainant said Marin told her on several other occasions that she should “suck his dick,” asked her the color of her underwear and asked if the color of her pubic hair was the same color as the hair on her head.</p>\n<p>The investigation also found that on an unknown date, coworkers found pornographic videos and newspaper clippings of the <em>Nexus</em>’ “Wednesday Hump” as well as “December 2006 Playboy Magazine Digital Edition” in his cleaning closet.</p>\n<p>Marin denied all such claims, but the Title IX office substantiated all 11 sexual harassment claims against him. The university terminated his employment in July 2013 following the findings of the investigation.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office received a report in April 2015 that a UCPD supervisor allegedly sexually harassed his female employee during an after-hours celebration at American Ale in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>According to the report, the male subject went to hug his employee and “grabbed her breast,” to which she “stood stupefied” and didn’t say anything. She went to push him away, but he “grabbed her face and stuck his tongue down her throat.” When she turned back around, he tried to hug her and “bit her neck, leaving a mark.”</p>\n<p>The documents report that, when the female returned to the outdoor seating area, she informed the group that she was attacked. A witness reported to the Title IX office that the same male had “pinched his/her buttocks earlier that night.”</p>\n<p>The male subject claimed he “blacked out” the night of the incident and could not respond to the allegations because he could not remember.</p>\n<p>At the time of the allegation, he was working half-time in his department, and he became a full-time employee in July 2015.</p>\n<p>As a result of the investigation, UCSB required the male subject to complete the university’s online sexual harassment prevention training and attend personal counseling.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office received a report in November 2015 that a music department lecturer allegedly sexually harassed a former music department student.</p>\n<p>The student claimed she was harassed through verbal conduct during piano lessons and that the male subject would comment on other women, saying “so-and-so’s boobs are hanging out,” “so-and-so’s ass cheeks are hanging out” and “women are provocative, and the things they wear seduce men, and it’s no wonder that all these women get raped.”</p>\n<p>Another complainant said the music lecturer would tell her sexualized comments he made to other students like, “If this composer was here, he’d want to seduce you.”</p>\n<p>The male subject denied the allegations against him, but the Title IX office concluded that the conduct “more likely than not did occur” and that the music lecturer had violated UC sexual harassment policy.</p>\n<p>As a result of the investigation, the male subject received a 10 percent salary reduction and a written censure.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office also received a report that a faculty member from the global studies department allegedly sexually harassed a fourth-year undergraduate student.</p>\n<p>According to the female complainant, the male faculty member made jokes promoting rape culture that had no relevance to the class. The jokes were, “What was the wife’s favorite sex position? Facing Nordstrom’s.” and “Why were the sorority girls disappointed about being gang-raped? Because they had to write so many thank-you cards.”</p>\n<p>The female complainant spoke out during lecture, saying that he was being inappropriate. The female subject dropped the global studies class that same day due to the “sexist classroom climate.”</p>\n<p>She stated in her interview with the Title IX office that she could not concentrate for the remainder of the class because she was so upset by his comments. When asked what resolutions she sought through the process, she said that she did not believe the male subject should be teaching at the university.</p>\n<p>According to the report, the male faculty member wrote through his attorney that he did not use the words “the wife,” “raped” or “sororities,” but admitted the jokes were made in poor taste.</p>\n<p>Following an investigation, the Title IX office substantiated one of the three sexual harassment claims against the faculty member. The documents do not indicate whether the university took further disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>According to UCSB Spokesperson Andrea Estrada, the university investigated and adjudicated all of the UCSB cases under policies and processes that have since been updated.</p>\n<p>“Over the past two and a half years, UC has taken steps to significantly change — and improve — the ways such cases are handled,” she said in a statement.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> also obtained the Title IX documents of eight other campuses — UC Merced, UC Los Angeles, UC Davis, UC Santa Cruz, UC San Francisco, UC Riverside, UC Irvine and UC San Diego — and is currently sorting through them to determine further details.</p>\n<p>Although UC Berkeley has not yet sent in its documents, the <em>Daily Cal</em> provided the number of sexual misconduct cases listed for its campus.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, March 2, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/documents-show-6-ucsb-employees-violated-title-ix-policy/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> in March that 124 UC staff and faculty members were accused of violating Title IX between January 2013 and April 2016. Of the six UCSB staff and faculty accused, all investigations were conducted under old Title IX policy from 2013, according to UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada.</p>\n<p>UC sexual harassment policy underwent its latest change in January 2016, after UC President Janet Napolitano organized the Task Force in 2014 on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Assault. The Task Force was comprised of committees dedicated to revising multiple aspects of the policy.</p>\n<p>Title IX is a federal state law ensuring that all students have the opportunity to participate in federally funded educational programs without discrimination based on sex. The law can apply to cases of sexual misconduct and assault and any university-affiliated organization, including sports groups and admissions.</p>\n<p>Of the six UCSB investigations, one faculty member received a salary reduction, and the university required another to attend sexual harassment training and personal counseling. Two cases ended with the termination of an employee.</p>\n<p>In other cases, the Title IX office substantiated the claims, but the university took no further disciplinary action as far as documents show.</p>\n<p>Estrada said in an email that it is “too speculative” to conclude if these case investigations would have resulted differently under the 2016 policy revisions.</p>\n<p>Kathleen Salvaty, the UC Title IX coordinator, also said she could not know if an outcome of a case would have been different under the revised policy, but she said the new policy changes would improve Title IX for future cases.</p>\n<p>“I can say that the current policy, and the recommended changes the campuses are implementing, have strengthened the University’s processes and procedures,” Salvaty said in an email.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76141\" style=\"width: 908px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76141\" data-attachment-id=\"76141\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/documents-show-6-ucsb-employees-violated-title-ix-policy/title-ix-graphic-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?fit=898%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"898,426\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"title ix graphic 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?fit=250%2C119&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?fit=888%2C421&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76141\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?resize=888%2C421\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?w=898&amp;ssl=1 898w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?resize=250%2C119&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?resize=768%2C364&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76141\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Adjustments made to the policy did, however, alter the way the UC investigates student and employee cases.</p>\n<p>According to Salvaty, under the new policy, Title IX officers review student-on-student sexual violence claims under the same procedures across all UC campuses.</p>\n<p>Employee-related cases also underwent “important provisions,” including the requirements that investigations must be concluded within 60 days, both the complainant and the respondent must be notified of the investigation’s outcome and the complainant must be informed of the repercussions imposed on the respondent.</p>\n<p>“Those are some big changes that come to mind,” Salvaty said in an email.</p>\n<p>While Salvaty could not speak about specific cases, she said cases reviewed under the older policy could not be reconsidered a second time, even though policies have changed.</p>\n<p>“I assume that if a matter was investigated and adjudicated under a then existing process, it could not be investigated again under a new process,” Salvaty said in an email.</p>\n<p>Salvaty said, however, that consequences for violators may differ depending on each university because decisions on penalties are decided upon by the supervisors of each case at the university, not the Title IX officers and investigators.</p>\n<p>This can result in varied forms of punishment for UC staff and faculty members.</p>\n<p>The UCOP Task Force recommended that each UC campus increase sexual harassment and assault training amongst staff and faculty and create a Campus, Advocacy, Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) Advocate on each campus to help survivors of sexual violence and sexual harassment, which UCSB has instated. They also recommend the development of a campus Peer Review Committee to review final investigation reports and advise the chancellor on disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>The UC campuses are currently in the process of implementing all the Task Force’s recommendations.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, March 9, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76340\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76340\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/","id":2415,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2414,2413,2412],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
