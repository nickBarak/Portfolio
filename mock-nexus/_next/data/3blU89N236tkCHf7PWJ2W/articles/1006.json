Prepare yourself for Paul George in Oklahoma City part two with Kawhi in Toronto — maybe Magic Johnson will find a new way to get caught tampering this time around.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Jimmy Butler Saga</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking at the Jimmy Butler situation in Minnesota feels like driving past a car accident: You worry for the people involved, but you still slow down to make sure you get a good look at the carnage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This whole fiasco has been great theater for anyone not involved with the Timberwolves, but we do have to keep in mind that Jimmy Butler will actually be playing basketball on an NBA court instead of making headlines off of it. The T’Wolves still do not have a trade partner for Butler, and every day that he is in Minnesota, his trade value goes down, putting more and more pressure on management to get a deal done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The baggage that Butler has accumulated over the past few weeks is going to follow him wherever he goes, and it will be interesting to see if another team takes the bait and trades for him and his massive ego.</span></p>\n<p><b>LeBron James to the Lakers</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After suffering through a full year of media theorizing and reports from unnamed sources, LeBron James finally put us all out of our misery after he signed a four-year $154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers on the first day of free agency last summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lakers also raised some eyebrows when they followed the signing of James by adding a few questionable characters, such as Lance Stephenson, Javale McGee, Michael Beasley and Rajon Rondo, all on one-year deals. They are going to have to work through some kinks as a team while they let Coach Luke Walton figure out how to turn this wacky personnel group into a functioning contender with LeBron at the helm.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have yet to see a LeBron James team not devolve into him playing iso-ball with four shooters standing around waiting for the ball to come to them, but this roster is built differently from any team LeBron has played for in the past, filled with both vets and young players. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The athletes on the Lakers this year could allow James to play with a faster pace and play more off-ball, which he has expressed a desire to do in the past. Whatever the fate of the 2018-19 Lakers turns out to be, the evolution and drama of this team will be fascinating.</span></p>\n<p><b>Demarcus Cousins to Golden State</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe the most unexpected move of the offseason was the already loaded Golden State Warriors adding another All-NBA player in DeMarcus Cousins on a one-year $5.3 million contract. The small-scale deal shocked the basketball world as Cousins decided to turn down possible max offers from other teams in favor of a one-year rental with the reigning NBA champs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The situation regarding Cousin’s free agency is unique considering he suffered a torn achilles tendon midway through last season, and his current status for when he will return is up in the air. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if his recovery takes longer than expected, the presence of an all-star center adds a brand new weapon to arguably the most dominant team in NBA history and also makes up for the personality void left by the departure of Nick Young and Javale McGee. </span></p>\n<p><em> A version of this story appeared on page 9 of

This impressive result landed the 2017-18 squad into the history books as it tied the team record for most games won in a single season. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team’s conference record of 11-5 was also good enough for a second-place seeding in Big West standings. The Gauchos concluded this campaign with a postseason semifinal showing, as the team exited the Big West Tournament earlier than anticipated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the Wyoming Cowboys, they finished with a 20-13 overall last season, during which they went 12-4 at home, 5-7 on the road and a neutral of 3-2. Their performance during conference play, however, wasn’t as compelling since their 10-8 record against Mountain West opponents placed them at a fifth-place seeding. Subsequently, Wyoming’s postseason aspirations ended in Game 2 exit after falling 75-85 to third-place New Mexico.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historically speaking, the UCSB versus Wyoming matchup isn’t too common, but both programs are familiar with each other. The last time these two sides met was back in 2012’s regular season, during which UCSB fell 68-40. In terms of all-time series record, the Gauchos only trail the Cowboys by 2-4 and will look to chip away at that lead come game time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a lot to be excited about for this new men’s basketball team, as with the departure of last year’s familiar faces comes the introduction of new names to cheer on. The three prospective freshmen to keep track of this year are forwards Jay Nagle and Amadou Sow and guard Sékou Touré. Additionally, when you pair fresh talent with a veteran presence, you get a team led by junior guard Max Heidegger. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the team’s forefront playmaker, Heidegger started all 32 games last year and earned a team-leading stat line of 19.1 points per game on a field goal percentage of 43.2 percent and three-point percentage of 40.4 percent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For added context, his impressive season was at a record-breaking pace in four different columns, under the “Individual Single Season” category, as Heidegger found himself fifth in points scored (612), 10th in scoring average (19.1), fourth in field goals attempted (451) and first in three-point field goals (95). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Per these statistical breakdowns, the offense will move through Heidegger and he’ll once again complement the Gauchos with his scoring production. Heidegger was also recently named to the 2018-19 Big West Men’s Basketball Preseason All-Conference Team for his actions and expected impact on UCSB’s upcoming season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In charge of it all from the sidelines is Joe Pasternack, head coach of the Gauchos. Pasternack will want to leave another lasting impression for his legacy this season, in his second year at UCSB, after also coming off an immense coaching job that set up his team’s historic 23-9 finish. His and his staff’s immediate impact helped reintroduce a winning culture to UCSB as he became the program’s “Most Successful First-Year Coach.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tipoff to the new men’s basketball season starts Tuesday night, Nov. 6, at 7 p.m., as Wyoming is set to host UCSB at the Arena-Auditorium in Laramie, Wyo.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84782\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-06/ucsb-heads-to-wyoming-for-2018-19-season-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84782\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-06/ucsb-heads-to-wyoming-for-2018-19-season-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-06/ucsb-heads-to-wyoming-for-2018-19-season-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-06/ucsb-heads-to-wyoming-for-2018-19-season-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-06/ucsb-heads-to-wyoming-for-2018-19-season-opener/","id":1004,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1003,1002,1001],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New-Look Raptors and Celtics Look to Dominate East","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-10-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NBA-Banner-10.17.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NBA-Banner-10.17.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The NBA off-season rarely fails to disappoint.

However, that was a long time ago, and perceptions change. After taking a year off to recover from a mysterious quad injury that forced the Spurs to trade him, he was dealt to the Raptors in exchange for DeMar DeRozan.</p>\n<p>All we know about him so far in Toronto is that he is a fun guy who will probably never pass for a normal person. However, his fit with Toronto could be amazing. If he returns to MVP form, a team that was already a great defense with DeRozan, who seems to enjoy when people dribble by him, could end up being the top defense in the league. Pair that with the addition of Danny Green, a 3-and-D specialist who was also acquired in the San Antonio trade, and they could have a great offense built around Kawhi. They still have a fantastic bench unit as well as Kyle Lowry, the NBA version of a bulldog.</p>\n<p>They could put out a small ball unit that absolutely terrorizes teams on defense and can force favorable mismatches on offense. This is all assuming that Kawhi returns to pre-injury form, but if he does, a team with the best regular season record in the East last year could be much better.</p>\n<p><strong>The Celtics and Chemistry Issues</strong></p>\n<p>On paper, the Celtics are one of the best teams, if not the very best, in the East. Last year, missing two All-Stars, they were one Lebron James away from being in the NBA Finals. This year, Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward both return, and both are reportedly in good health. The question is how they will be able to manage the demands of individual players. No other team besides the Warriors has as much talent throughout the lineup as the Celtics, and the Warriors are the rare team that can combine talent and unselfishness to make dynastic level talent work out.</p>\n<p>The last time we saw the Celtics, Terry Rozier was being very scary, Jayson Tatum was the primary scorer and Jaylen Brown was the second in command on the wing. This year, however, with as many wing scorers as they have combined with the touches Kyrie will have, it will be interesting to see if they can keep all the talent happy enough to stay together. Al Horford will still put together an underrated season built on passing, spacing the floor and rebounding,  but how the rest of the lineup will interact with each other remains to be seen. Brad Stevens does have a great coaching record so far, but he’s never had a complete season coaching this talented of a team, and it will be interesting to see how he uses all the pieces he has been given.</p>\n<p><strong>LeBron and the Playoffs         </strong></p>\n<p>The last time LeBron James didn’t make the playoffs was 2005. Just for points of reference, I had just started kindergarten and the first iPhone came out in 2007. We’ve come to just expect LeBron to be in the playoffs, partly because of his transcendent talent and partly because of his residence in the inferior Eastern Conference.</p>\n<p>Moving to the Lakers has made the inevitability of seeing LeBron in the playoffs thrown into question. LeBron’s signing of a four-year deal signaled that he thought championship aspirations were not feasible this year, but the playoffs are a different story. In order to get into the playoffs, we can look at the bottom of the Western Conference and go from there. The Timberwolves made it last year, but with all the Jimmy Butler drama, I wouldn’t be surprised in the least if they take a fall in the wins column this year. That really leaves the Nuggets and the Spurs for the Lakers to overcome in order to clinch a playoff berth.</p>\n<p>Even though the Nuggets are good and only getting better with a young core centered around savant Nikola Jokic, and even though the Spurs have not missed the playoffs since before the turn of the century, it still feels like something has to give. If I had to take a guess, the Nuggets are probably going to be moved down a spot. The Spurs got the seventh seed last year with Kawhi not playing, which makes the addition of DeMar DeRozan a huge improvement. Even with the Lakers’ young core and a veteran group that feels like it would be more at home in a comedy than on a basketball court, expect to see LeBron in the playoffs this year.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 9 of the Oct. 19 edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The NFL has become so deeply ingrained into American culture that the Super Bowl has become a national holiday, and even traditional holidays such as Thanksgiving are commonly centered around “the game” for many families. Statistically, the sports industry has never seen an economic powerhouse like the NFL before, with its annual revenue coming in at roughly $13 billion.</p>\n<p>Regardless of its clear-cut dominance in viewership and revenue, NFL ratings are down. The recent political  controversies surrounding the sport have been nothing but bad news for fans, players and owners across the country. In contrast to these issues, the NBA and its players have procured a huge growth in interest worldwide. The NBA will surpass the NFL as America’s most popular sport within the next five years.</p>\n<p>When it comes to modern-day popularity contests, the first place to look is social media clout. The NFL Network and NBArank of ESPN both recently came out with a list of the top 100 players for 2018. The top 10 NFL stars on the list have an accumulated 14.4 million followers on Instagram, with Tom Brady having the most on the list at 4.2 million followers. The top 10 ranked NBA players, on the other hand, have a staggering 107 million instagram followers in total. LeBron James himself has nearly <em>three times</em> the amount of followers as the top 10 NFL superstars <em>combined</em>.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In a culture full of icons and celebrities, the NBA simply has more enticing characters that the fans want to keep up to date with.</p>\n<p>The enormous margin between the NFL and NBA on social media attests to the idea that fans already find basketball to be their favorite sport. NBA players have created personal brands that allow the fans to be more connected to the game, and because of that the blue checks are stacking up enormously compared to the media presence of NFL stars.</p>\n<p>Heck, J.R. Smith’s Hennessy memes and Carmelo Anthony’s hoodie are getting more air time on the internet than NFL stars nowadays. The future of all entertainment is in the development of social media, and the NBA is clearly dominating that sector.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the biggest problem leading to the NFL’s demise is the prevalence of not only season-ending injuries but also life-ending injuries. Repetitive brain trauma has been proven to result in violent mood swings, depression and many other cognitive difficulties.</p>\n<p>Aaron Hernandez, a former tight-end for the New England Patriots, was convicted for the murder of Odin Lloyd and eventually hung himself in prison at the age of 27 years old. He had severe and late stages of CTE in his brain. His family is now suing the Patriots and the NFL on the grounds that they “were fully aware of the damage that could be inflicted from repetitive impact injuries and failed to disclose, treat or protect him from the dangers of such damage.” Brain damage of players in the NFL is an epidemic, one that will take away from the game in a multitude of ways.</p>\n<p>One of the medical pioneers of CTE, Dr. Bennet Omalu, spoke with NFL personnel who told him, “If 10 percent of mothers in this country would perceive football as a dangerous sport, that is the end of football.” Even now we see that former players are speaking out against their kids playing the game, such as Troy Aikman, who was quoted on HBO saying: “If I had a 10-year-old boy, I don’t know that I’d be real inclined to encourage him to go play football, in light of what we are learning from head injury.”</p>\n<p>In response to this health crisis, the NFL has altered the rules of the game significantly over the years, but this in itself is a problem. More penalties slow the flow of the game, alter the outcome in a non-competitive way and eliminate the intrinsic excitement of violence in the fans’ and players’ beloved game. In the NBA, the worst injuries in recent history were those of Gordon Hayward or Shaun Livingston, who are both back on the court ready to compete for a championship this upcoming season with little to no lifelong damage to their bodies.</p>\n<p>Many of those concerned for the health of their son or daughter are going to be more than willing to put them on a basketball court and extremely fearful of letting them get hit on the football field. In a world that is becoming increasingly less tolerant and less attracted to violence, basketball is becoming the most viable athletic option for both the families and the players.</p>\n<p>Let’s face it, this country is dedicated to the people who are getting paid, and NBA players are getting paid by the likes of which we have never seen before. In Forbes’ list of the top 100 richest athletes in the world, there are 40 NBA players and just a mere 16 who represent the NFL.</p>\n<p>Not only are contracts for playing basketball at an all-time high, but NBA players are also signing much larger endorsements. This means they have become significantly more valuable to companies’ public image and ability to sell products due to their popularity.</p>\n<p>In 2018, LeBron James will receive $52 million and Steph Curry will pull in $42 million from endorsements. This is more than they will make from their basketball contracts. The top endorsed NFL players are Drew Brees with $11 million and Eli Manning with $8 million — a fraction of what NBA superstars are making annually. The brand image of NBA players have hit an all-time high because the popularity of basketball is increasing rapidly worldwide. Even when Madden 2018 was being advertised this past year, they used NBA players James Harden and Chris Paul in the commercial promoting it. Oh, and according to Forbes, “NBA 2k18” just hit a new record of over 10 million copies sold, ranking it the number seven bestselling game of the year, whereas “Madden” didn’t even make the top 10. Companies are utilizing this newfound popularity to boost their company’s sales and are leaving NFL players out because they aren’t what’s “hot” right now. NBA players are taking business into their own hands as well, as seen in the pinnacle of business-minded athletes such as Michael Jordan, who is worth $1.4 billion and is now the world’s richest athlete ever. Basketball players are not just playing sports; they are creating companies and becoming ubiquitous in corporate advertising— all of which promote the status of the NBA.</p>\n<p>NBA players are redefining pop culture in a way that the NFL is not. Politically, the NBA has always been at the forefront of progressive ideas, whether it be the Golden State Warriors boycotting the White House visit, LeBron James’s infamous tweet toward Trump or the countless philanthropic charities and donations made by players all over the league. The NFL, on the other hand, has refused to give roster slots to Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid for “standing” up against police brutality, yet it continues to provide careers for countless players charged with sexual assault, domestic violence and DUIs.</p>\n<p>NBA players also stay active in the entertainment industry outside of basketball, from the newest collaboration of Dame Dolla and Lil Wayne to Kyrie Irving’s new movie “Uncle Drew” to even more serious ventures like LeBron James’s new docuseries called “Shut Up and Dribble.” They are constantly using their charismatic personalities to enter other fields of the entertainment industry, and this trend is only going upwards from here. Fashion is probably the most influenced by NBA players as well. Brands like Jordan, Nike and Adidas all flock to NBA stars to push athletic gear off their shelves. Even Lavar Ball’s antics have allowed Big Baller Brand to reach a cult following in the fashion industry globally. After all, when’s the last time you bought anything from Tom Brady’s brand? You haven’t. Basketball players have always held a fun-loving stereotype, which has left us with stylish shoes, hilarious memes, countless rap songs and, most importantly, strong role models. The NFL sells itself as a logo and rarely contributes to life outside of the realm of football.</p>\n<p>If I had to invest in one of them, I would put my money into the NBA every time.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the September 20</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84138\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-03/why-the-nba-will-surpass-the-nfl-as-americas-favorite-sport/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84138\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-03/why-the-nba-will-surpass-the-nfl-as-americas-favorite-sport/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-03/why-the-nba-will-surpass-the-nfl-as-americas-favorite-sport/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-03/why-the-nba-will-surpass-the-nfl-as-americas-favorite-sport/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-03/why-the-nba-will-surpass-the-nfl-as-americas-favorite-sport/","id":1003,"author":{"id":257,"name":"Prescott Creveling"},"related":[1002,1001,1000],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
