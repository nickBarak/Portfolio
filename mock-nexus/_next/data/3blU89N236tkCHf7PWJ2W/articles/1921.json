The Cavs star also helped introduce Clinton during a rally held in Cleveland where he endorsed her a second time.</p>\n<p>Now the 45th president-elect of the United States, Trump mentioned the support he had received from Tom Brady and Bill Belichick during a rally in New Hampshire a day before the election.</p>\n<p>Brady had previously made a statement in favor of a Trump presidency and a Make America Great Again hat was seen in his locker over a year ago.</p>\n<p>Although the two athletes supported candidates who were on opposing sides, the fact that both were willing to take the steps necessary to use their influence during this year’s election is an important liberty that other athletes should be encouraged to take.</p>\n<p>Athletes have historically received criticism for taking stances on political issues. During the 1968 Summer Olympics, U.S. runners John Carlos and Tommie Smith famously did the Black Power salute in the medal ceremony, raising their black-gloved fists in the air while the national anthem played.</p>\n<p>The athletes were subsequently banned from the games, and upon returning home they found themselves, and their families, receiving death threats.</p>\n<p>The two Olympic runners never wavered from their protest, and just this year the pair supported another protest from a fellow athlete, Colin Kaepernick.</p>\n<p>The San Francisco 49ers quarterback has been kneeling during the playing of the national anthem in football games since the start of the 2016 season in protest of recent wrongdoings done to the black community in America.</p>\n<p>Fellow football players have joined Kaepernick in his protest during the national anthem, and the reason for his protest has inspired other demonstrations in other professional leagues.</p>\n<p>On July 9 and 10, several teams in the WNBA wore black shirts in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. They bore the names of victims Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. The teams also wore shirts in memory of the five victims of the Dallas shooting.</p>\n<p>The WNBA fined the three teams (the New York Liberty, the Indiana Fever and the Phoenix Mercury) $5,000 each, and each player was fined $500 for violating the league’s uniform policy.</p>\n<p>The WNBA later rescinded the fines and vouched support for the players’ protest, but the initial punishment is exactly the type of action that prevents and intimidates players from attempting to use their platform to make their political statements.</p>\n<p>No matter what the political views or stances are that athletes desire to use their platforms to advocate for, the leagues must commit to providing an environment for athletes to utilize their First Amendment rights and demonstrate if they choose to do so without fear of reprisal.</p>\n<p>Players like the ones in the WNBA, Colin Kaepernick and LeBron James are no different from the likes of celebrated athletic and cultural icons like Jackie Robinson, Muhammad Ali, Tommie Smith and John Carlos.</p>\n<p>These players from the past and present have used their platform and influence to evoke change, not because of a need to boost their own profile, but to serve the basic human desire to speak out against something that is unjust and unfair.</p>\n<p>These players deserve to be seen as people, not just athletes, who patriotically utilize their First Amendment rights to take a stand despite criticism from the public or even their own league.</p>\n<p>All athletes from across the country, whether at the professional, collegiate or high school level, deserve an environment conducive to exercise their constitutional rights.</p>\n<p>“In any protest, I think you make a statement to try and reach the far ends of the Earth. What better way to do it than if you’re in a sport,” Carlos said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 17, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74273\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/to-silence-the-voice-of-the-voiceless/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74273\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/to-silence-the-voice-of-the-voiceless/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/to-silence-the-voice-of-the-voiceless/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/to-silence-the-voice-of-the-voiceless/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/to-silence-the-voice-of-the-voiceless/","id":1921,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1920,1919,1918],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez","biography":"Not available","articles":[45,52,64,67,68,69,71,1111,1132,1136,1160,1162,1165,1169,1170,1172,1197,1201,1202,1204,1205,1377,1380,1383,1388,1399,1497,1921,3342,4097,4106,4111,4266,4268,4270,4273,4274,4282,4287,4819,4822,4828,4889,4891,4892,4893],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Cubs Win World Series, End 108 Years of Torment","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-11-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ap_16308175159360.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ap_16308175159360.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After 108 years, the curse is over and the Cubs are winners again.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_73821\" style=\"width: 591px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73821\" data-attachment-id=\"73821\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/cubs-win-world-series-end-108-years-of-torment/ap_16308175159360/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ap_16308175159360.jpg?fit=1500%2C1111&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1111\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ap_16308175159360\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ap_16308175159360.jpg?fit=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ap_16308175159360.jpg?fit=888%2C657&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-73821\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ap_16308175159360-1024x758.jpg?resize=581%2C430\" alt=\"David J.

The Cubs, having not won since 1908, and the Indians since 1948, gave both teams the intense motivation to push them to game seven. Each game, inning, and play has kept baseball fans across the nation glued to their televisions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leading by three at the top of the eighth inning, the Cubs had reason to feel confident, but leave it to the Indians to come back from behind when pressure is on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This has been the first World Series to be tied in the ninth inning since 1991 between the Twins and the Braves, according to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mlb.com.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> These two knock-out teams managed to keep it tied and send the game into extra innings, stirring up every Cubs and Tribe fan alike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here it was, the 10th inning that will go down in Cubs baseball history. Indians pitcher Bryan Shaw  intentionally walks Anthony Rizzo, a hitting all-star this post-season, as well as Addison Russell,  to prevent any chance of hits from these two. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Zobrist slammed double into left field, sending Albert Amora Jr. home to push the Cubs ahead. Miguel Montero, then singles, knocked Rizzo home for another run. The Cubs headed into the bottom of the 10th with just three outs standing between them and their first World Series title in over a century. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crowd has seen this scenario before in the eighth inning when the Indians were able to turn it around; the real question was would they be able to pull it off again in the 10th?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carl Edwards Jr., Cubs reliever, managed to snag two outs. But with one left, the Indians scored as right-handed hitter Rajai Davis smacked a line drive to center field. Mike Montgomery enters as the Cubs attempt to clench one last out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within two pitches, the Chicago Cubs had made history. It took every member of the team, both offensively and defensively, to achieve what this group has achieved, and the victory is oh so sweet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Zobrist, Cubs second baseman, and seasoned player, was named Series MVP after his hit in the 10th-inning of game seven that changed baseball history. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zobrist was most recently a Kansas City Royal and helped in winning the 2015 World Series. His presence on the field as a defender has made quite the impression, causing </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">usatoday.com</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to call him a “super utility player,” as well as his stellar record as a switch-hitter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mlb.com</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Cubs coaches and administrators alike have called Zobrist a professional and role model both on and off the field — both from his “work ethic” to “clubhouse professionalism.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A close runner-up would have been Rizzo as he played an enormous role in leading his team to victory, but the second baseman’s title was well earned. Ben Zobrist is a name no Cubs fan will ever forget. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This National League powerhouse team was chosen early in the 2016 season as a team to watch and has now surpassed all expectations and crushed all doubts. Congratulations to the 2016 World Series Champions, finally, the Chicago Cubs!</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73815\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/cubs-win-world-series-end-108-years-of-torment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73815\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/cubs-win-world-series-end-108-years-of-torment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/cubs-win-world-series-end-108-years-of-torment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/cubs-win-world-series-end-108-years-of-torment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/cubs-win-world-series-end-108-years-of-torment/","id":1919,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[1918,1917,1916],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“Our struggles as students are intertwined with the struggles of workers”: A.S.

We will do everything we can to limit the strike’s negative impact,” he added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the complaints filed earlier this month, AFSCME additionally alleged that the UC secretly amended union contracts after contact with non-union vendors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB has comparatively fewer AFSCME workers than larger campuses with medical centers such as UC Los Angeles, according to Silva, who added that the smaller numbers of union workers will contribute to a relatively smaller protest next week.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s been less and less workers at each strike because not everyone can afford to take that whole day of wages off,” Silva said. “We anticipate more students than workers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC has increased spending on outsourcing on campuses by 23% since 2016, and 84% with medical centers, according to documents filed with the California legislature.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The number of AFSCME-represented service workers has also grown 16.8%, in the past five years, while the number of patient care workers has jumped 27.9%, Gordon said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada said that the university has plans in place to “mitigate any impacts” from the upcoming strike, but declined to provide further details. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91114\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-10/our-struggles-as-students-are-intertwined-with-the-struggles-of-workers-senate-endorses-upcoming-afscme-strike/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91114\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-10/our-struggles-as-students-are-intertwined-with-the-struggles-of-workers-senate-endorses-upcoming-afscme-strike/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-10/our-struggles-as-students-are-intertwined-with-the-struggles-of-workers-senate-endorses-upcoming-afscme-strike/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-10/our-struggles-as-students-are-intertwined-with-the-struggles-of-workers-senate-endorses-upcoming-afscme-strike/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-10/our-struggles-as-students-are-intertwined-with-the-struggles-of-workers-senate-endorses-upcoming-afscme-strike/","id":1920,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[1919,1918,1917],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate through a resolution authored by Letters and Science Senator Olivia Campos (above) and Off-Campus Senator Tianna White. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I</span>da Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The app was introduced to the Associated Students (A.S.) Senate through a resolution authored by Letters and Science Senator Olivia Campos and Off-Campus Senator Tianna White; however, it was Sir who first proposed the idea during her presidential campaign in the Spring Quarter 2019 election.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re keeping it simple,” Sir said to the Nexus, explaining that ideally, the app will have two main features: a “feed” with all Office of Student Life (OSL) organizations and A.S. events </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">similar to other social media apps, with reminders that can be customized to each student </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and a notification system that would inform students of free food available on campus.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there is, for example, a “catered event on campus with lots of leftover food” the app would then alert students, Sir explained. Users can also input their food preferences into the app and indicate any food allergies they might have. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is gonna be the hook that brings people in,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir, who has spoken to the Nexus several times regarding the project, said her goal is to bring “A.S. out of the dark ages” with the app, which would contain all A.S. and OSL-related sources in one place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campos and White’s resolution echoed several of Sir’s points, stating A.S. resources “are in need of being updated and more readily available to the student body.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The student body does not have a cohesive source of information regarding Associated Students and the Office of Student Life events and meetings,” the resolution states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campos said that Sir initially approached the Senate a few weeks ago, looking for the senators’ support for her project. Campos and White then offered to write the resolution in support of the app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The app] follows closely with a lot of things we hoped to accomplish as a 70th Senate,” Campos said to the Nexus. She added that she believes the app will make it easier for students to see the programs and resources available to them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Senate’s meeting on Wednesday night, College of Engineering Senator Diana Reyes Carrillo brought up her concerns about the app, pointing out that creating it would be “time consuming” and that it is “naive” to start the process of creating an app if there “hasn’t been research if students want one.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes Carrillo abstained from the final vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hiring of a developer would be handled by A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez, according to the resolution. During Senate, Internal Vice President Alli Adam explained that a “significant portion” of the app has already been built by UCSB Information Technology (I.T.) and that a software developer would bring the “final touch.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam said that Márquez plans to hire a developer within two months but does not know how long it will take the hired developer to finish the work started by I.T. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
