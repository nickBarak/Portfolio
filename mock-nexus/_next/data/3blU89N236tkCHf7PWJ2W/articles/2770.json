Valentine’s studies in soft materials research focuses on how forces are generated and transmitted in living materials, and how these forces control cellular outcomes.</p>\n<p>Valentine said one goal of her research is to pave the way for women and underrepresented students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (S.T.E.M.) fields through teaching and outreach.</p>\n<p>“The outstanding record of ESPCI ParisTech in the recruitment and retention of women to S.T.E.M. fields was one of the many attractions in selecting it, and France, for my sabbatical,” Valentine said. “I hope to return to UCSB with a better understanding of how the French educational system engages and supports female students, and suggestions for how the U.S. system could be improved.”</p>\n<p>Mechanical Engineering Department Chair Francesco Bullo said Valentine’s research makes important strides in addressing problems posed in the medical field.</p>\n<p>“Dr. Valentine is an extremely productive and talented researcher,” Bullo said. “Her project, ‘Creating tough, fatigue-resistant materials, inspired by nature,’ leverages her expertise in biological systems and protein engineering while tackling important new problems in materials research, specifically bio-inspired self-healing materials.”</p>\n<p>According to Valentine, the materials in her study operate similarly to the technology in bike helmets, which employ a “controlled collapse” of a foamy core to absorb impact energy and protect our skulls.</p>\n<p>“My focus is on developing materials that can dissipate energy during loading through the controlled breakage of sacrificial bonds,” Valentine said. “This approach of toughening by weakening is not new … but the work proposed here goes further by incorporating reversible bonding schemes that allow the sacrificial bonds to reform when the load is removed, thus allowing the materials to ‘heal.’”</p>\n<p>Valentine said her research builds upon previous studies in producing improved adhesives and drug transportation vehicles, working toward a deeper understanding of the properties of living materials in synthetic systems.</p>\n<p>“I am particularly excited about biomedical applications and the development of materials for use in artificial heart valves, vascular grafts and joint repair,” Valentine said.</p>\n<p>Bullo said Valentine’s research will also allow for a continuing relationship with ESPCI ParisTech.</p>\n<p>“Her selection as a Fulbright awardee recognizes the excellence of her scholarship and her contributions to education and science,” Bullo said. “I am extremely proud of her accomplishments and look forward to the increased interactions with ESPCI ParisTech facilitated by this award.”</p>\n<p>First-year mechanical engineering major Ryan Tsukamoto said materials research can be applied to many aspects of science, engineering and biomedical processes.</p>\n<p>“I believe that investigation of living materials will provide valuable insight to not only medicine but all fields of science and engineering,” Tsukamoto said. “A better understanding of how living structures interact will definitely enhance medical diagnosis and treatment methods.”</p>\n<p>Valentine said collaborating with Creton’s research group will allow her to broaden her expertise in biomaterials and protein<br>\nmechanics.</p>\n<p>“I will also introduce the Creton group to the novel measurement tools that my group has developed for materials testing, in particular our suite of customized ‘magnetic tweezers’ tools which allow the application of very local forces to soft materials for spatially-resolved materials characterization,” Valentine said. “I also hope that my stay in Paris leads to long-term,</p>\n<p>fruitful collaborations between ESPCI and UCSB.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the Thursday, April 30, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A version of this story said “Valentine’s studies in soft materials research primarily involve the production of man-made materials”, however Valentine’s studies focus on living systems and the previous is true only for her research with the Fulbright Scholarship. The article also incorrectly stated Valentine received the award on April 27 when she was notified of her selection on December 22. The article has been updated accordingly.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62961\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/meche-professor-to-receive-award/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62961\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/meche-professor-to-receive-award/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/meche-professor-to-receive-award/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/meche-professor-to-receive-award/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/meche-professor-to-receive-award/","id":2770,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2769,2768,2767],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli","biography":"Not available","articles":[2332,2347,2356,2359,2380,2387,2428,2433,2440,2446,2452,2460,2463,2464,2468,2470,2474,2484,2497,2510,2521,2528,2555,2569,2573,2626,2627,2628,2642,2706,2745,2751,2753,2756,2766,2770,2806,2836,2975,2979,2987,2993,3451,3593,3596,3759,3762,3765,3899,3901,3909,3963,3965,3969,3986,4462,4464,4483,4505,4521,4623,4647,4699,4768],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

A.S. Internal Vice President elect and third-year sociology major Kimia Hashemian will be recruiting and appointing two new on-campus senators to fill the positions.</p>\n<p>Three of the thirteen applicants will not begin attending UCSB until the fall and therefore do not yet qualify for the position. Hashemian will be interviewing the remaining ten to select two for the senatorial positions.</p>\n<p>Incoming A.S. officials for the 2015-2016 school year will be sworn into office on May 20, and following that an ad hoc committee will be created to select two new senators to be approved by the A.S. Senate. The three on-campus senator elects, first-year political science major José Magaña, first-year art history major Lacy Wright and first-year economics and political science double major Nawar Nemeh will be sitting in on the interviews with Hashemian.</p>\n<p>Korbas said he was required to resign from the position because he will not be living on campus next year.</p>\n<p>“I’m not actually allowed to have the position because I’m not living on campus,” Korbas said. “I could have moved back to the dorms but I didn’t really want to.”</p>\n<p>Korbas also said he initially ran for on-campus senator position after being encouraged by a friend in the FTP party.</p>\n<p>“My friend told me to join his new party and made it sound like it wasn’t too much work, so I thought why not,” Korbas said.</p>\n<p>Wright said she is unsure about the circumstances surrounding Xie’s resignation.</p>\n<p>“I do not know the full context as to why David Xie resigned, but I am sure that he was doing what he felt was best for him and I support his decision,” Wright said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Hashemian, the low turnout for on-campus senator candidates during elections may be due to the requirement that on-campus senators must live in residence halls. Hashemian also said some students were applying to be Resident Assistants (RAs) at the time and were not allowed to apply for both simultaneously.</p>\n<p>“For the on-campus senator positions, it is difficult to get many students to run because you have to live in the residence halls again, and most first years are living off campus [next year],” Hashemian said in an email. “Another reason could be that during the same time Senators choose to run is when RA interviews happen.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh said A.S. positions require a large time commitment, and tuition increases going into effect this fall may put a financial strain on potential candidates.</p>\n<p>“A.S. is a time commitment that a lot of students just can’t afford,” Nemeh said in an email. “With the tuition hikes going into place next year, less of us will have time to participate in our governance because we need to redirect our time to paying off our loans.”</p>\n<p>Wright said on-campus senators should adequately represent the various types of students on campus.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is really such a diverse community and I want our senate to represent the diverse ideas and interests on this campus,” Wright said in an email. “I am hoping for someone who is passionate about working to improve this campus.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Committee Chair and second-year political science major Fiona Hayman said student participation in the spring election this year was lower than previous years, and the Elections Committee aims for a greater number of student to turn out next year to participate in A.S.</p>\n<p>“The number of students participating in the election was overall lower than in past years,” Hayman said in an email. “It is hard to put a finger on the reason why less students were involved, but Elections Committee plans to engage in increased outreach and publicity efforts to get more students interested in elections next year.”</p>\n<p>According to Nemeh, on-campus senators should be cognizant of students’ needs and be motivated to make changes.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking for people who want [to] create real, tangible change,” Nemeh said in an email. “The Senate needs students who are willing to go out there and find out what is it that students need.”</p>\n<p>Hashemian said some students are not familiar with A.S. and therefore do not run for positions, an issue she said should be addressed.</p>\n<p>“Most students are not as well informed on exactly what Senate is, therefore didn’t apply. I do believe there should be more effort into recruiting candidates,” Hashemian said in an email.</p>\n<p>“Students should know what A.S. is from the beginning … spring elections should not be the first time students hear about A.S. Senate.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63351\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/a-s-to-fill-posts-after-resignations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63351\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/a-s-to-fill-posts-after-resignations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/a-s-to-fill-posts-after-resignations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/a-s-to-fill-posts-after-resignations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/a-s-to-fill-posts-after-resignations/","id":2768,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2767,2766,2765],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: Freebies and To-Dos This Week","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vistapoint-2-copy.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vistapoint-2-copy.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"From tenants rights workshops to a ministry adventure to Knapp's Castle, Vista Point has all of your events in Isla Vista for the week.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_74412\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74412\" data-attachment-id=\"74412\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-24/the-weekly-goings-on-in-isla-vista-thanksgiving-edition/vistapoint-2-copy/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vistapoint-2-copy.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,683\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"vistapoint-2-copy\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vistapoint-2-copy.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vistapoint-2-copy.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74412\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vistapoint-2-copy-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vistapoint-2-copy.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vistapoint-2-copy.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vistapoint-2-copy.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-74412\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>ICE ICE BABY</strong></p>\n<p><em>Ice in Paradise</em></p>\n<p><em>Friday 10 p.m. to 12 a.m.</em></p>\n<p>Double the fun this weekend with Ice in Paradise and the UCSB hockey team.

succulents and canvases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Back the Night (TBTN) is “a forum for survivors and allies alike to make their voices heard, [and creates] an environment in which survivors of sexual violence can begin to heal,” according to the organization’s website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organization’s main goal is to raise awareness for sexual assault through “activism, advocacy, and survivor empowerment,” said Emily Umana, TBTN’s finance coordinator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Planned Parenthood, Counseling and Psychological Services and the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center set up booths during the rally to give out buttons, coloring books and further information on their respective organizations, offering help to anyone who has experienced sexual assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaker Kat Alexander, founder and chief executive officer of “Report It Girl,” a web platform aiming to give survivors of sexual assault a platform to speak out, recounted her personal experiences to the crowd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She described how being a survivor of both rape and incest impacted her life and urged the men and women at the event to be honest with themselves about the tragedies they have endured.</span></p>\n<div

said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexander spoke about the need for survivors of sexual assault to speak up about what has happened to them and about how surrounding oneself with a community of people is crucial. She explained that approaching traumatic experiences head-on instead of pushing them away is important.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanted to know that there was at least one person out there who had even remotely gone through what I had been through,” she said. “Grief is a totally appropriate response if you have experienced trauma.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexander asked the students listening to get into groups with their friends and share ways in which they were going to decide to address the negative emotions that arise within their own lives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I come from an area where [sexual assault] wasn’t talked about,” said Linnea Loeb, second-year biology major. “It’s important to have a presence so people know not only that they’re not alone, but that they have allies.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s really cool to have an organization focused on women empowerment and women acting for women,” said Layla Hernandez, a second-year English major who attended the rally.</span></p>\n<p>In an email this Saturday, Jane Diep, TBTN co-chair, said the organization prefers to emphasize intersectionality and makes efforts to be inclusive of all sexual assault and interpersonal violence, not just women, because “people of all genders experience [sexual assault].”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organization hung teal and purple bandanas around UCSB’s campus for sexual assault awareness month and in preparation for the event, according to Umana.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want this rally to increase awareness and participation to combat rape culture and interpersonal violence. We hope to have individuals inspired and understand what they are fighting for,” Umana said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to their annual spring rally, TBTN meets weekly to discuss how they can combat rape culture and make UCSB and I.V. safer for women.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article previously referred to Loeb as a TBTN member. Diep, a TBTN co-chair, has informed the Nexus that the organization’s executive board does not recognize Loeb as a member. This article now uses “survivor” to refer to people who have been sexually assaulted, where before it used “victim.”</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82615\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-20/take-back-the-night-rallies-against-sexual-assault-sets-space-for-healing/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82615\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-20/take-back-the-night-rallies-against-sexual-assault-sets-space-for-healing/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-20/take-back-the-night-rallies-against-sexual-assault-sets-space-for-healing/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-20/take-back-the-night-rallies-against-sexual-assault-sets-space-for-healing/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-20/take-back-the-night-rallies-against-sexual-assault-sets-space-for-healing/","id":2769,"author":{"id":88,"name":"Katie Wolf"},"related":[2768,2767,2766],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
