Much like the past few years, the Gauchos defeated the Warriors but Saturday’s victory might have been the most dominant of them all.</p>\n<p>UCSB took down Westmont by a final tally of 5-1 thanks to a strong first-half performance that saw the Gauchos score four goals to the Warriors one.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Santa Barbara outshot Westmont 14-3 in the first half and 19-3 for the entire contest. Of the 19 total shots the Gauchos took Saturday, 14 of them were on goal, a solid number for any match.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Leading the way in the first half was junior forward/midfielder Shaelan Murison who started off the scoring in the 11th minute when she controlled a cross with a nice chest trap and then fired in a goal off the right crossbar. The assist was credited to newcomer Katherine Sheehy, a junior transfer from SBCC.</p>\n<p>Three minutes later the Gauchos would tally another goal when senior Madeline Gibson snuck one past the goalkeeper. Murison and sophomore Christine Maurer earned the assist on the play.</p>\n<p>Westmont would retaliate in the 39th minute when junior Maddi Berthoud scored the only goal for the Warriors on Saturday. Berthoud took all three shots Westmont registered in the match which comes as a surprise to no one as she was led the team in assists and was tied in goals with 11.</p>\n<p>It wouldn’t take long for UCSB to get the lead back up to two, however, as Sheehy knocked in her first goal as a Gaucho with a header that knocked off the left post.</p>\n<p>It was certainly a great night for the forward transfer in her first night representing the blue and yellow as she had a game-high two assists to go along with her lone goal. Head Coach Paul Stumpf praised Sheehy and her quality play throughout summer practice and it certainly showed why in this exhibition.</p>\n<p>Following Sheehy’s goal, the person who began the scoring, Murison, would help give the team an even bigger advantage at the conclusion of the first half knocking in another goal in the 44th minute.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara would score one more in the contest in the as midfielder Sydney Magnin knocked in a free kick from 25 yards out.</p>\n<p>Overall, Saturday went about as perfectly as it could for the Gauchos as not only did they put on a show on offense, something the team had their struggles with last season, but they also were able to get everyone playing time as every single active person on the roster logged some action.</p>\n<p>UCSB has a lot of questions to answer this season. With the loss of Amanda Ball who scored 20 of the teams 53 goals over the past two seasons, it would be interesting to see who would step up and lead the team this year.</p>\n<p>While Saturday night might not have shown one standout player it did show a collective group of women working well together and that could be just the thing to revitalize a program that has missed the conference tournament the last two seasons.</p>\n<p>UCSB will kick off its season against Sac State at 4 p.m. Friday, August 17th at Peter Johann Field in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Racioppi didn’t let another ball past her for the remainder of the tournament, which saw the Gauchos top Ohio, Vermont, Cal Poly, Penn State and Texas in succession.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, UCSB’s easiest wins were its last two. The Gauchos blew out the Nittany Lions 4-0 in the semifinal and hung a 3-0 shutout on the Longhorns in the tournament final.</p>\n<p>A dominant defense was the common thread between this year’s championship team and last year’s side.</p>\n<p>UCSB surrendered only one goal in the 2016 tournament, which saw the Gauchos defeat UNC in a 1-0 thriller for the title.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s club soccer success goes beyond just the last two seasons. No other team has more than three national titles in the last 11 years. The Gauchos have seven.</p>\n<p>“One of the traditions we like to talk about is our success on the field and what we bring to each game,” Head Coach Todd Heil said. “Back-to-back is great and seven is pretty impressive, but year in and year out we’ve just been very fortunate to have a great group of girls.”</p>\n<p>Such dominance is only possible through passion and commitment on the part of everyone involved in the club soccer program. That starts with the players, naturally.</p>\n<p>“With the club sports mentality, it’s a group of girls that just truly want to be there and want to play the game,” Heil said. “They’re there on their own behest; they’re not there on scholarship. They are what some might call the true student-athletes, and when it clicks and they just want to all be there together, that’s even more special.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the players contribute more to the program than just their on-field performance. They’re the front-line recruiters for the team as well, manning booths and getting the word out in order to bolster the roster each year.</p>\n<p>“A lot of [the recruitment] is on the returning player,” Heil said. “Basically, you’re [creating] the path. If it’s not social media, then you’re working a table at Spring Insight. You’re just trying to get the word out once students actually become students of UCSB.”<br>\nOnce the recruitment work has been done and the season has actually started, things don’t get any easier for the club players.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s soccer club team practices three times a week rather than six times like the Division I team, but it has to balance those practices against a full schedule of academics and extracurricular activities.</p>\n<p>“Our weeks are so busy that the weekends would be a great time to get school work done, but during fall these weekends are filled with games,” Club President Ann Marie Mansholt, a four-year player, said. “This just means that time management is crucial, and we somehow get it done, whether it’s studying on a plane or in the lobbies of our hotels.”<br>\nThe club season starts right alongside school in late September and wastes no time in getting going.</p>\n<p>“We get going the first week of school,” Heil said. “We have regionals the fourth week of school and nationals is basically right around that seventh week of school. That’s cramming in a lot. You’re playing about 15 soccer games pretty quickly.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79948\" style=\"width: 372px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2028394936\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79945\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79948\" data-attachment-id=\"79948\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/ucsb-womens-club-soccer-shines-in-back-to-back-fashion-win-7th-national-title-with-3-0-win-over-texas/wcsoccer_pic2-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?fit=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"WCSoccer_Pic2 (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-79948\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1-768x1024.jpg?resize=362%2C482\" alt=\"\" width=\"362\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=1122%2C1496&amp;ssl=1 1122w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=840%2C1120&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?w=1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79948\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Photo Courtesy of Jordan Burke</em></p></div>\n<p>It’s a lot to ask not only from the players but from the coaches as well. Heil is the boys’ soccer coach at Santa Barbara High School as well as a club soccer coach, but he manages to balance his responsibilities and keep the team running smoothly.</p>\n<p>“The continuous success starts with our coach, Todd Heil,” Mansholt said. “He has been the coach since the start of this club about 18 years ago. He has built this program from the bottom up and has given this program consistent leadership.”</p>\n<p>While the club team may not get as much academic and structural support from the university as the Division I team does, that doesn’t mean it is on its own. Both Heil and Mansholt made sure to credit the Recreational Sports program for its support of their team and all other club squads.</p>\n<p>As a senior, Mansholt is going out on top. It’s an emotional experience, but she’ll be leaving behind a program with a deep tradition of success and a bright future.</p>\n<p>“I believe this team can continue success into the future by keeping the close bonds we have formed and keeping true to our style of soccer,” she said. “Now that this younger group has a taste of winning back-to-back national championships, I believe they will keep working harder than ever to win another one and keep having a blast while doing so.”</p>\n<p>That ethos of success and hard work balanced with fun is what makes the UCSB women’s club soccer team, and all club sports, special. They might not get the glory of a Division I team, but they’re student-athletes all the same.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Nov. 30</em><em>, 2017, edition of the Daily

hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia. The world’s most watched sporting event is missing usual contenders like Italy, Netherlands, and long-running qualifiers like Ghana, Ivory Coast, and the United States are also missing. In their place, underdogs like Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Egypt, and Tunisia, the most Arab nations to qualify for a single World Cup. Panama and Iceland will make their first appearances in the Tournament, with Iceland being the smallest country to ever qualify with a population less than 350,000. With old contenders rebuilding around new stars, and the presence of some surprising teams, this year’s World Cup might be the most unpredictable in some time. That won’t stop The Daily Nexus though! Here are our 5 boldest predictions for the World Cup!</p>\n<p><em>Russia Will Not Make It Out of Group A</em></p>\n<p>Russia has a rich history of competitive soccer. They qualified for Brazil 2014 by winning their group outright over Portugal. They’ve reached as high as third on the FIFA Rankings in 1996 and their average position in the FIFA rankings, which has existed since 1993, is a very respectable 23rd. Add in the traditionally non-threatening presence of Egypt and Saudi Arabia in the host country’s group, Russia would normally easily skate through to at least a second place showing, if not challenge Uruguay for the top spot. However, no points are awarded for tradition at the World Cup, and Russia will have to earn it’s spot in the knockout stage with perhaps their worst team in history. The FIFA Rankings has Russia at its lowest spot in history this month at 66th. They have not won a single game this year and their best recent result was a tie with Spain, where they gave up three goals in St. Petersburg at the end of last year. To put it shortly, Russia is one of the few teams in the tournament that has been steadily trending downward over recent months. After Egypt’s Mohamed Salah’s record-breaking performance this year at Liverpool, the Pharaohs’ one-man show should be enough against Russia’s porous defense to advance Egypt past the host nation, who may become the second host team to not reach the knockout stage after South Africa in 2010.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>France Won’t Get To The Knockout Stage</em></p>\n<p>France has been raved about in early previews of the World Cup as the deepest team in the tournament. You could even make a competitive squad from the French players, who did not get the invite to Russia. Led by Manchester United standout Paul Pogba, and a veteran captain in goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, France is deserving of its status as a contender this year. Just like they were in 2002 as defending champs or in 2010 as defending runner-ups, when they couldn’t get past the group stage. France is obviously a favorite on paper, but some French media are worried about this version of the squad. “This French team lacks character and mentality”, said Christophe Dugarry after a friendly loss to Colombia. Of perhaps all the major contenders, France may be the team most likely to surprise us all and flame-out in the group stage like they did in 2010.</p>\n<p><em>All 5 South American Teams Win Their Groups</em></p>\n<p>We’ve already touched on Uruguay’s favorable Group A, but do not be surprised if the majority of the groups are won by South American squads. Argentina and Brazil are contenders to win the whole tournament, let alone their group. Colombia drew perhaps the most wide-open group with their only real roadblock being a one-man show in Robert Lewandowski’s Poland and an underrated Senegal team. Still, Colombia, led by James Rodríguez, the leading goalscorer at Brazil 2014, should be a slight favorite to top the group.</p>\n<p>While Peru will be making their first appearance since 1982, make no mistake they are not to be underestimated. The last time they lost a match was to Brazil in 2016! That’s not a bad streak to bring into the Cup and they are easily one of the hottest teams entering the tournament. We’ve already seen France’s penchant for struggling in the groups now and again and if Peru can take care of them, then Australia and Denmark shouldn’t be any more challenging. Even with star Paolo Guerrero sidelined by a doping suspension, Jefferson Farfán and the rest of Peru’s team will continue their hot streak and top Group C.</p>\n<p><em>3 African Teams Make the Knockout Stage Setting a New Record</em></p>\n<p>We’ve already touched on a talented Egyptian squad led by Mohamed Salah, and an underrated Senegal who should only need to beat an unbalanced Polish team to take second in Group H. Nigeria is another squad that has a shot to make it through. They have a solid group, but have had goalkeeping issues with 19 year old Francis Uzoho the likely starter. If he can hold it together for them between the sticks, it possible they could beat out plucky Iceland and solid Croatia. Those three seem to be Africa’s best shot of getting to the knockouts, but crazy things happen in the World Cup and maybe Tunisia or Morocco make some noise. Three squads in the knockouts would be an unprecedented result for African soccer, and while it is a bold prediction, don’t be surprised to see Africa cement itself as the clear third best soccer region behind Europe and South America.</p>\n<p><em>A South American Team Will Win The World Cup</em></p>\n<p>Argentina and Brazil have always been huge soccer powers, but have been lacking in World Cup victories for a while now. Europe has won 3 straight an all-time record, including the first European win in South America with Germany’s dominant run last year. On top of that, South America has not won a World Cup on European soil since Brazil’s win in Sweden in 1958. Here’s why it could change this year. Brazil is highly motivated after last years embarrassment against Germany in the semi-finals and they’re dialed in after a recent 1-0 victory over the defending champs. Messi wants to cement his status as the greatest of all time and perhaps only a World Cup victory will bring that to him. After European dominance on the sport’s biggest stage it’s time stars like for Neymar, Messi, James, and Cavani to reestablish South America as the center of the soccer world. Brazil breaks through for another World Cup championship, while Argentina and Colombia do serious damage in this tournament.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83450\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/five-bold-predictions-for-the-2018-world-cup/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83450\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/five-bold-predictions-for-the-2018-world-cup/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/five-bold-predictions-for-the-2018-world-cup/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/five-bold-predictions-for-the-2018-world-cup/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/five-bold-predictions-for-the-2018-world-cup/","id":1365,"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes"},"related":[1364,1363,1362],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The 71 Year Old Man With the Cane, Ronaldo/Messi’s Fall, and the New Hero","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2018-06-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-1.jpg?resize=468%2C312&ssl=1","description":"With the World Cup in full swing, staff writer Omeed Soltanalipour covers some of the most exciting storylines thus far and gives his predictions for tomorrow's matches.

Two very important matches occurred earlier today. Early in the morning, Argentina and France faced off, later in the day, Portugal and Uruguay played. Never have I seen such exciting games at this stage of the competition. I will breakdown the first match played at 7:00 A.M. first.</p>\n<p>France came in with high hopes for this tournament. Not only do they have an excellent lineup of talented players, but they also have a few familiar faces with more experience and growth. Griezmann, Pogba, and Giroud all performed exceptionally well this world cup. There is one star who has just made it to the limelight however. His performance will probably go on in history, for decades to come.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>​That man is Kylian Mbappé Lottin. Born in Bondy, just shy of 19 years ago, Mbappé has risen to the ranks of the young Ronaldo. Early in the game, a quick sprint by Mbappé propelled him past the Argentinian defense into the penalty box where he was fouled. This gave the French their first opportunity as they received a penalty kick. Griezmann shot it and delivered! Then, the unthinkable happened. Right near the end of the first half, Di Maria hit it right in the net. The game was all tied up 1-1 heading to the break.</p>\n<p>Right near the start of the second half. Mercado deflects a shot by Messi and hits it in. Now, the French are on the verge of elimination! 57th minute, the French respond right back tying it up at 2 goals each. The game continues on until the return of Mbappé, who scores another goal for the French side bringing them up 3-2. Just minutes later, Mbappé comes in again and scores for France.</p>\n<p>Near the last minutes of the match, desperate Argentinian sides do whatever it takes to catch up. The 93rd minutes sees Sergio Agüero hit it in. Unfortunately, this wasn’t enough for them. Messi and company will go home tonight. France will move on to face either Uruguay or Portugal.</p>\n<p>It is great to be a football player; you get to really live a great life. Not to mention the amount of money you make. Mbappé however, does not seem too motivated by the money. The man, who scored two goals for the French, wants to donate all of his FIFA earnings to charity. What a great guy!</p>\n<p>Just a few hours later, Uruguay, led by the 71 year old Óscar Tabárez faced off against Portugal lead by, well, Ronaldo maybe? Uruguay delivered an incredible performance ousting the Portuguese. Early in the first half, Cavani, assisted by Suárez, shot it in. In the 55th minute, Pepe for Portugal responded tying this game up 1-1. This ended Uruguay’s run of 597 minutes of not conceding a goal. Pretty amazing, if you ask me! Then, in the 62nd minute, Cavani scores again for the Uruguayan side. Portugal tried very hard to make something happen, but block after block shut them down. Uruguay took this one by their teeth. It could not have happened without their head coach however.</p>\n<p>Tabárez, pictured below, suffers from a rare degenerative disease known as Guillain-Barre syndrome. It mainly affects the limbs and causes numbness and weakness. Through it all, he decided to fight through and help his team move forward. The 71 year old is nicknamed ‘El Maestro’ (The Teacher) since he used to work at a school.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1881650776\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83622\"><img data-attachment-id=\"83624\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-30/the-71-year-old-man-with-the-cane-ronaldo-messis-fall-and-the-new-hero/omeed-pic-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg?fit=468%2C305&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"468,305\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Omeed pic 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg?fit=250%2C163&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg?fit=468%2C305&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83624\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg?resize=468%2C305\" alt=\"\" width=\"468\" height=\"305\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg?resize=250%2C163&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&amp;ssl=1 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>At the end of today, two teams are through. France and Uruguay will be facing off next week on Friday at 7 A.M PST. This one will be quite the thrill. I think it will be very close, but France will have the edge. Looks like Messi and Ronaldo won’t be meeting for a match this world cup. Yet, they will still be meeting at the airport on the way back!</p>\n<p>Tomorrow we will see the World Cup hosts face off against 2010 World Cup champions. Later in the day, a powerful Croatia will face off against Denmark, who tied against France. I think Croatia and Spain will come out victorious. Stay tuned for more updates!</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83622\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-30/the-71-year-old-man-with-the-cane-ronaldo-messis-fall-and-the-new-hero/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83622\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-30/the-71-year-old-man-with-the-cane-ronaldo-messis-fall-and-the-new-hero/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-30/the-71-year-old-man-with-the-cane-ronaldo-messis-fall-and-the-new-hero/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-30/the-71-year-old-man-with-the-cane-ronaldo-messis-fall-and-the-new-hero/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-30/the-71-year-old-man-with-the-cane-ronaldo-messis-fall-and-the-new-hero/","id":1366,"author":{"id":304,"name":"Omeed Soltanalipour"},"related":[1365,1364,1363],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
