Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Kopel selected Justin Nilsen, former solicitor general for the attorney general’s office, to fill the position of chairman.</p>\n<p>The Judicial Council is made up of one chairman, four members and one advisor, the latter of who does not vote on decisions, according to its website.</p>\n<p>At the end of last year, two of the three members, Matthew Lanthier and Roshni Sopariwalla, graduated, leaving Raymond Alonso, a current second-year political science and history of public policy major, as the only member on the council.</p>\n<p>Currently, the council has one active petition and one order of business to address relating to the position of EVPSA as well as allegations of campaign violations committed by Campus United (CU) that could disqualify all CU senators as well as Kopel.</p>\n<p>At the Senate meeting Wednesday night, Kopel said she had been holding off on appointing students to the council for several reasons. For one, she is charged with filling four seats for positions that students hold until they graduate.</p>\n<p>“Once you’re on, you’re making decisions for potentially four years, and that’s why I don’t take it lightly,” Kopel said. “That’s why I want to make sure that since I’ve been in the random situation that four new seats have opened when I’ve become president, I want to make sure that the best people and the fairest people are appointed, and that comes with time.”</p>\n<p>She also stated that of previous applicants, none of the students she reached out to had responded, leaving her no choice but to start up another round of applications during the summer.</p>\n<p>Currently the Committee on Committees (COC) is reviewing the applications. Once they conduct interviews they will make their recommendations to Kopel, who plans on conducting her own set of interviews as well.</p>\n<p>As for Nilsen, Kopel said she has known him since his freshman year through their involvement with mock trial.</p>\n<p>“I worked with him a lot, and saw how smart that dang kid is,” she said. “Really the drive he has for advocacy, and just judiciary in general, and so when he expressed interest to me in being on judicial council, I really considered him, knowing already what I knew about him and also looking at his answers to the questions that everybody else filled out.”</p>\n<p>Kopel stressed the importance of filling up the Judicial Council so that any open cases could be properly addressed.</p>\n<p>At the Senate meeting, Letters and Science Senator Ricardo Uribe requested that the Senate be allowed to question Kopel’s appointments before approving them, referencing the fact that Nilsen was unable to be present at the meeting.</p>\n<p>After moving the item into discussion, senators debated the merits of questioning the presidential appointments, a practice Kopel said was historically unprecedented.</p>\n<p>Marisela Marquez, Associated Students (A.S.) executive director, said that while in recent history, presidential appointments have not been scrutinized as heavily, there has been a past of senators questioning the selections.</p>\n<p>As Senate moved into discussion regarding Nilsen’s appointment, many agreed that they would like the opportunity to get to know him before making decisions that would affect their constituents.</p>\n<p>“I really want to respect Brooke and her appointments, [but] we should be able to ask questions…we should just be 100% confident that they will be able to do their job, nonbiased,” said Senator Christian Ornelas. “I just think it would be irresponsible not to ask questions.”</p>\n<p>As they took their vote to table the appointment until they would be able to question Nilsen, Proxy Rose Ettleson asked the Senate to commit themselves to the same process for future candidates.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The <em>Nexus </em>then obtained police arrest records for the charges in question.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara Police Department (UCPD) officers first arrested Martinez on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive in Isla Vista at approximately 11:40 a.m. on Feb. 14, according to arrest records. Martinez was charged with inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant.</p>\n<p>She was booked in the Santa Barbara Jail on $25,000 bail and was released around 1 a.m. on Feb. 15, according to arrest records.</p>\n<p>Martinez pleaded not guilty. A settlement conference will be held in September, according to Santa Barbara trial court records. Martinez is being tried as a defendant against the People of the State of California.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.occourts.org/self-help/restrainingorders/criminalrestrainingorders.html\">criminal protective order</a>, which requires a “restrained person” not to “hurt, threaten, or communicate with the other person,” was filed on March 14, according to court records.</p>\n<p>In a separate incident, California Highway Patrol (CHP) stopped Martinez on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive in I.V. on March 1 at approximately 1:50 a.m. on charges of driving under the influence with a blood alcohol percent of over 0.08 percent, according to arrest records.</p>\n<p>Martinez is also being charged with possession of a controlled substance, according to court records. The charge is not present in the arrest records, however.</p>\n<p>She was cited with a $5,000 bail and was released from the Santa Barbara Jail around 11:20 p.m. later that day, according to arrest records.</p>\n<p>An arraignment will be held for the DUI charges on June 26, according to court records.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/live-a-s-election-results-2018/\">Martinez was elected</a> in late April and officially sworn in as Student Advocate General (S.A.G.) last Thursday. The S.A.G. works within the Office of Student Advocate, which works to help students who “face charges from the University in housing, academic, social conduct, and public interest matters,” according to the OSA website.</p>\n<p>Martinez also served as a letters and science senator on the A.S. Senate during the 2017-2018 school year. She declined to comment for this story.</p>\n<p><em>Shomik Mukherjee contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of the article appeared on p.5 of the May 31 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

The stated goal of the forum was to foster “constructive and respectful debate,” according to UCSB College Republicans president Leslie Garcia.</p>\n<p>During the group discussion portion, participants broke into roughly six groups ranging from five to ten members.</p>\n<p>Discussion was guided by the following three questions, which were displayed on a screen at the front of the room:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do you believe that the right to due process has served the purpose envisioned by the authors of the Constitution?</li>\n<li>Does due process help to facilitate justice?</li>\n<li>Is the principle “innocent until proven guilty” the best way for organizing a legal system?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While the discussion questions focused on the legal implications of due process, participants also heavily discussed Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings and the national uproar left in the wake of his confirmation.</p>\n<p>Speakers then shifted the topic from due process in the legal system to due process in public life. Eleven participants volunteered to speak during the open mic and were given a maximum of two minutes each.</p>\n<p>California College Republicans co-chair Andrew Gates stressed the necessity of maintaining due process, even in the court of public opinion. He advocated for the reflection of constitutional values in American culture throughout the discussion.</p>\n<p>“Even though it is technically true that we don’t have to abide by the stringent standard of due process that a court of law has to abide by, in cases like Kavanaugh…we should live in the spirit of the constitutional principles,” he said.</p>\n<p>A minority of people disagreed with Gates, stating that due process should not apply outside of the legal system.</p>\n<p>Fourth year mathematics major Dylan Pizzo spoke about the infeasibility of applying due process in the real world.</p>\n<p>“Suppose you’re looking at prospective hires. An applicant…at their previous job were accused of embezzling, and it turned out to be inconclusive whether they did it or not,” Pizzo said.</p>\n<p>“The probability that they are an embezzler is much higher now… [supporters of cultural due process] are saying that an employer should hire this person…even if the probability that they are an embezzler is much higher.”</p>\n<p>Some speakers chose to focus on misconduct allegations, specifically sexual misconduct allegations with little direct evidence, such as first year political science major Ally Baker. She questioned whether the testimony of an accuser should be sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p>“As important as testimonies are…there comes a point when you do need more evidence,” she said. “Are personal testimonies considered evidence?”</p>\n<p>Gates denounced the notion that accusers should be sided with when little evidence is available, pointing to the destructive effect that false accusations can have on the lives of the accused.</p>\n<p>“I really worry about a society where just because the person is a woman and just because there does exist this terrible tragedy of rape that we automatically have to believe every accuser who comes forward. I think that’s bullshit,” Gates said.</p>\n<p>“I think that people downplay the effect that a false accusation can have…Let’s say that the studies that the feminists put forward are true, that 2 to 10 percent are false accusations. Even if it were 2 percent, like that’s fucking crazy to me.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said she was pleased with the way the forum went.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot of very constructive and respectful discussion, and it seemed that a lot of people in the room had different opinions on the questions that were posed,” she said.</p>\n<p>As the school year progresses, UCSB College Republicans hopes to hold additional monthly forums to provide spaces for debate on controversial topics, according to Garcia.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84708\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-college-republicans-host-public-forum-to-debate-validity-of-cultural-due-process/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84708\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-college-republicans-host-public-forum-to-debate-validity-of-cultural-due-process/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-college-republicans-host-public-forum-to-debate-validity-of-cultural-due-process/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-college-republicans-host-public-forum-to-debate-validity-of-cultural-due-process/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-college-republicans-host-public-forum-to-debate-validity-of-cultural-due-process/","id":2244,"author":{"id":231,"name":"Eric Wang"},"related":[2243,2242,2241],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
