Herman </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-23/galoustian-files-motion-in-court-requesting-ucpd-internal-documents-alleging-violation-of-due-process-in-his-arrest-and-investigation/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">heard a motion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from Patrick Galoustian’s lawyer, who argued that UCPD officers may have tampered with evidence related to Galoustian’s case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Galoustian, who was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-21/owner-of-iv-menus-arrested-on-3-felony-charges-of-rape-pleads-not-guilty/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arrested in December 2017</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on sexual assault charges, has spent the last two years in jail. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Doe v. UCPD lawsuit, UCPD Officer Ryan Hashimoto allegedly circulated an edited video of Galoustian sexually assaulting a woman. Documents state Hashimoto “mock[ed] an evidence video” by mimicking Galoustian’s accent and made sexual references to the victim. An Internal Affairs investigation has since been opened into Hashimoto’s actions, as stated in court on Wednesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of the cases will remain stalled in the Santa Barbara County Superior Court while the plaintiffs attempt internal mediation with the university.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

page </span></em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What most students don’t know, however, is that this post didn’t belong to a student at all — it belonged to a professor, seasoned with over a decade’s worth of experience in the art of memeing with enough practice to likely earn himself a degree in it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The professor, Bob Kennedy — a linguistics lecturer at UCSB — first dipped his toes in the university’s meme scene years ago, when he began posting on a now-defunct Facebook group.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think your cohort is not aware of the fact that there was a different UCSB meme page around 2011, 2012 or so. It’s still up, but it’s fallen into disuse and nobody posts on it,” Kennedy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I stopped checking because there was no activity on it. But then I think it was during Thomas Fire, one of my students mentioned to me, ‘Hey, Professor Kennedy, you’ve got to check out the [new] meme page because the memes people are making about the fire are hysterical,’” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to jokes of his own, Kennedy blends in well with the student-generated memes around him, posting pictures of slumped-over trees and punny captions to appease viewers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up until recently, Kennedy says most of his activity on the “Zesty Meme Cuisine for Horny Teens” meme page has been spent “lurking,” or scrolling through the page without posting. But he actively posts on a linguistics meme page he maintains himself, which he said is chock-full of “really niche humor.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Those [linguistics] jokes are lost on just about everybody,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Kennedy said the jokes that don’t work serve to teach him about the ones that do. After teaching at UCSB for over 15 years, Kennedy has had ample time to hone his craft. He’ll opt to inject “a little bit of playful humor” while teaching a class, which oftentimes helps him make a point or lighten the mood. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If I have humor in class, it’s either self-deprecating or it makes fun of people in power.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But memes, on the other hand, serve a different purpose. Kennedy finds that the nature of memes — “a quick joke” — enables people to laugh at “content that everyone can get right away.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it doesn’t need to be explained, then people are gonna respond well,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s not to forget about the downsides of meme culture, such as the potential for a “destructive” or “nasty” message — which Kennedy said is generally the result of cracking a joke intended to be funny but ends up offensive in its delivery. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Another thing that comes up, especially in the teaching context, is where we confront humor that’s hurtful. And so in some of my classes, I do this: I’ll say, ‘Look, here’s the point of view that someone had tried to make with a joke and it’s offensive and their defense is going to be, ‘Well, come on, I’m just trying to be funny,’” Kennedy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s never an appropriate response to defend a joke that’s been hurtful to someone else,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid this, however, Kennedy suggests that anyone looking to crack a joke should bear in mind their own identity as to not “punch down” with their humor, or make a joke that pushes the boundaries on one’s identity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kennedy defines himself as a “straight, white middle-aged person,” which means “the only people I can tell jokes about are people who think they’re smarter than they are, people who are wealthy or people who are older than myself,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He made note of comedy’s magnitude in the academic world, some of which has spilled into classrooms at UCSB with Linguistics 135, a course dedicated to memes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have a colleague in my department who teaches a class on memes and it’s a deep dive into theories of what it is that people are tapping into when they make [memes],” Kennedy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s scholars who study the structure of humor and joke templates and everything else like that. And the nature of how humor plays a role in conversational interactions,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although a linguist by trade, Kennedy said he uses comedy to not only make students laugh, but to also use memes’ shared “overlapping” sense of humor to better understand social practices used among college students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The student perspective] is valuable to me,” which opens doors to a culture that “people my age ought to be more aware of than pretend like we’re annoyed by it or anything else like that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So next time a funny meme floats across your screen — look twice — it may be your professor. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The closest Planned Parenthood to UC Santa Barbara is a little over 11 miles away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After three years of working to expand access to medication abortion at our public universities, I am thrilled that Governor Newsom rejected the misguided paths that other states have taken in limiting access to abortion care,” Senator Connie Levya, who authored both bills, said in a press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am also grateful for the many students and advocates that stood alongside me. Without them, today would not have been a reality.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill allocates $200,000 to each UC and CSU campus student health center to cover the costs of providing abortion medication, including “Facility and security upgrades,” “Costs associated with training staff in the provision of abortion by medication techniques” and “Staff cost reimbursement and clinical revenue offset while staff are in trainings.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An additional $200,000 each will be allocated to the UC and CSU systems to pay for “24-hour, backup medical support by telephone to patients who have obtained abortion by medication techniques at a public university student health center,” among other training and budgeting costs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC student health centers currently provide students with access to comprehensive reproductive health services, and this new law will further access to medication abortion by providing these services on-site,” Sarah McBride, spokesperson for the UC said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McBride added that the system “is currently evaluating next steps and will implement the law accordingly.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily Montalvo-Telford ‘19, who lobbied for SB 24’s passing and was present this morning when Newsom signed the bill into law, said the passing of the law made her feel “safe.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It can be very scary and stressful to know that your basic rights are always up for debate, especially what we’ve been seeing at the federal level, but right now I feel good and I feel safe because I know California is leading the fight for reproductive justice and my rights are upheld right now,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, Montalvo-Telford served as president of Students Against Sexual Assault last year and worked with justCARE: Campus Action for Reproductive Equity, a statewide organization that advocates for abortion pills on college campuses, and UCSB’s Students for Reproductive Justice, to advocate for the bill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year political science major Philippa Villalobos, current director for Students for Reproductive Justice, said that in addition to the organization’s work on campus, which included phone banking and tabling, they made multiple trips to Sacramento and testified at Senate and Assembly meetings in support of the bill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Villalobos denounced Brown’s decision to veto the initial bill, explaining that “even if it were five miles, as students, it’s really difficult to get off campus.” In addition to having to potentially miss class multiple times and depend on often unreliable public transportation, Villalobos added that off-campus clinics can often have long wait times as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Aside from the physical barriers and financial barriers, a big issue too is the lack of community and discussion about pregnancy on campus,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And so by bringing this onto campus, you’re offering students a safe way to access abortion and have a conversation and not feel so alone.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and quickly washed away </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on a sidewalk adjacent to fraternity Sigma Pi. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an effort to fill in the gaps, students jumped to social media and ignited a firestorm of posts that called for the university to play a more transparent role in informing the student body </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">beyond sharing a list of “safety tips” attached to the bottom of the timely warning. Others began pointing fingers at specific fraternities on Twitter; although unconfirmed, some tweets went viral. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A timely warning from the university is a product of deliberation and consideration, according to Miles Ashlock, associate dean and director of the Office of Student Life (OSL). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university elicits a timely warning on a “case-by-case basis” based on factors surrounding the incident, which include “the nature of the crime, the serious or continuing threat to the campus community, and the possible risk of compromising law enforcement efforts,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to release the timely warning with undisclosed information stems from the Clery Act, a campus security law that aims to facilitate transparency in campus crimes and statistics, according to the Clery Act’s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://clerycenter.org&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1571898031086000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHySLJ3MlOIp8a4Zzggc0tQ8AZzXw\">website</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, student leaders in registered campus organizations, such as a fraternities or sororities, are not mandated to report instances of sexual violence and sexual harassment and instead attend annual trainings “in interpersonal violence prevention strategies,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a crime occurs on “Clery geography,” which, according to the Clery Act’s website, includes non-campus buildings “owned or controlled by a student organization,” the university makes a judgment call to “evaluate if there is a serious or ongoing threat to the campus community,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In our communications, we strive to be sensitive to the impact that the message may have on survivors and to be careful not to create the potentially false sense of security (by naming one location over another, particularly when we may not have sufficient information to like the offense to a particular residence),” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Associated Students President Alison Sir said she met with campus administrators following the release of the timely warning out of concern for survivors and those unaffiliated with Greek life who feel “uncomfortable” about the situation. In a meeting with Assistant Vice Chancellor &amp; Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn, Sir said she learned the timely warning was not specific to one fraternity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The timely warning is about multiple IFC frats and frats outside [of IFC] — like in [multi-cultural] groups. [The university] didn’t want to release the names because I know a lot of students are angry about that because they’re all under investigation,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir also addressed the “victim-blaming” nature of the timely warning’s “safety tips,” which she said the university opted to include after learning of one allegation that claimed a fraternity had laced a bottle marked with an “X” on it and would choose “who would get [the bottle] or not.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was basically IFC frats and frats outside of IFC as well, nothing was finalized [and] they were still investigating, so they didn’t want to release any names of people involved.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Wednesday’s Senate meeting, Sir addressed Senate regarding the timely warning. She said she is working with Klawunn and Armistead to develop a “task force” of administration members, community leaders and students to review policies and practices addressing sexual violence in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir told senators that the task force will “encourage safer behavior and develop better response practices.” At this time, Sir was unsure who would be appointed to the task force, but said she will ensure that every “stakeholder” in the issue would be involved in the task force. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When further questioned by Senator Benjamin Chocron, Sir added that these stakeholders include IFC and Panhellenic members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir also advertised an upcoming Sexual Assault Town Hall, hosted by Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) – to be held on Nov. 14 at 6 p.m. in Corwin Pavilion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The news brought by the timely warning drew an immediate response of “abhorrence and disgust” in the eyes of SASA’s president, Alia Reynolds, a third-year global studies and philosophy double major. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We condemn any and all individuals or organizations which knowingly allow such actions to take place, or foster an environment which allows individuals to feel they can take such actions,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many students who spoke up on social media, Reynolds concluded that the university’s response was “not adequate” and that “[SASA] firmly advocate[s] for the university to release the name of the fraternity organization[s] associated with the incident.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds said SASA has created a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sasa-ca.org/index.php/svsh-map/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1571899623049000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE3PY3zJdSKCobVCHpizGDfPV5mTg\">“Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Map”</a> which allows survivors to “anonymously submit the date, location and any details they wish to disclose about an instance” of sexual violence or sexual harassment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The frequency of incidents similar to those described by the timely warning call for “a larger conversation regarding the prevalent cultural and social context within Isla Vista and many other communities,” Reynolds said. “We believe a larger cultural shift in accountability </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">must take place within our community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday, a message responding to the timely warning was chalked </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and quickly washed away </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on a sidewalk adjacent to fraternity Sigma Pi, emboldened with the words “hold frats accountable.” The chalking belonged to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.instagram.com/catcallsofsantabarbara/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1571899698047000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFNB-6PuIpmW2S0nHEJL271ArepsA\">@catcallsofsantabarbara</a>, an Instagram account that posts anonymously submitted stories of sexual harassment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two representatives of the account, who wish to remain anonym</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ous to avoid retaliation, told the Nexus they first heard about the timely warning after receiving multiple screenshots of the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After speaking with a “few members of the Greek community,” one representative of the account said they were under the impression that Sigma Pi was the fraternity mentioned in the timely warning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two days after making a post about an incident at Sigma Pi, the representatives received information that contradicted their original beliefs regarding the fraternity, subsequently leading them to retract any posts implicating the fraternity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The conflicting information, which came from a “very credible source,” made it clear to the representatives that the situation ran “a lot deeper than we expected” and was not limited to one specific fraternity, the two stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Sunday, the Instagram account announced a “boycott” against Sigma Pi, where they planned to march from Sea Lookout Park to the Sigma Pi house, but the march was cancelled “to give time for the victims to heal,” a post on the account’s page read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many on social media, Spencer Brandt, board president for the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), said he was “horrified” by the timely warning and supports students’ calls for the university “to name the fraternit[ies]” where the incidents occurred.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD is partnering with Standing Together to End Sexual Assault, an organization dedicated to providing counseling and support services to survivors of sexual assault, Brandt added. The </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/csd-finalizes-contract-with-ucpd-for-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interpersonal violence investigator program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a collaboration with the UC Police Department and I.V. CSD, has been in place since 2018 to investigate cases relating to sexual violence, according to Brandt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The truth is that no one deserves to be made into a survivor. We all need to take a hard look at the I.V. culture and ask ourselves what about it enables so much sexual violence.” </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evelyn Spence and Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><i>Correction [Oct. 24, 1:26 a.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that President Alison Sir partnered with SASA for the Survivor Town Hall.
