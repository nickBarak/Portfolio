There, they will take on the winner of the UC Irvine-Hawaii match.</p>\n<p>On paper, Irvine seems to be the more likely opponent for UCSB. Despite only going 2-3 in conference play, they finished the season 15-11. In their matchup earlier this season, they defeated Hawaii 7-0.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara had the advantage of playing at home, where they finished the season 11-0, they were still able to dominate the Anteaters 7-0.</p>\n<p>In particular, the Gauchos leaned on their top three players: junior Nicolas Moreno de Alboran, sophomore Joseph Guillin and senior captain Simon Freund. In that particular match, all three players dominated, winning their matches in straight sets.</p>\n<p>If UCSB hopes to win the tournament, they will need those three to be on top of their game.<br>\nGuillin, a transfer from Florida, has been nothing short of spectacular in his first season as a Gaucho, earning a 19-2 dual match singles record. Freund has also been great, as he has won eight straight matches and earned a 15-5 mark in dual matches.</p>\n<p>Moreno de Alboran, ranked No. 76 in the country, has tallied a very solid 27-10 overall record and a 14-5 mark in dual matches. Being the only Big West player that has been ranked nationally, Moreno de Alboran will likely be invited to participate in the NCAA Singles Championships next month so long as he does not lose his ranking, giving him extra incentive to continue playing well in this tournament.</p>\n<p>Where Irvine gave the Gauchos some trouble, however, was at the lower courts, a place where Santa Barbara particularly struggled earlier in the season.</p>\n<p>On courts four and six, the Anteaters took UCSB to three sets, proving that they at least have the skillset to hang tight with them on those courts. Irvine is a talented team, and without the advantage of playing at home, the Gauchos will need to be on their A-game, especially since they will have had a day off already.</p>\n<p>If Hawaii beats Irvine, UCSB will be favored fairly heavily in that matchup. Despite only going 3-14 on the season, the Rainbow Warriors were able to eke out two conference victories, making them the fifth seed in the tournament.</p>\n<p>While they once again had the advantage of playing in front of a home crowd, UCSB was in charge of their regular season matchup with Hawaii from start to finish. In fact, Santa Barbara did not drop a single set during the entire match.</p>\n<p>If UCSB can advance to the championship game, they will most likely have a rematch with Cal Poly in what was a very top-heavy conference this year.</p>\n<p>Just days ago, the Gauchos went into SLO and blanked the Mustangs 7-0 to take the regular season title.<br>\nThat being said, Cal Poly is an incredibly talented team, having gone 17-6 on the season and 4-1 in the conference.</p>\n<p>In their matchup, UCSB used the doubles point in order to nullify the home court advantage of Cal Poly. Led by the No. 85 duo in the country, Moreno de Alboran and junior Anders Holm, who eked out a win on court one 6-4, the Gauchos were then able to take that momentum into singles play, where they won every single match.</p>\n<p>That being said, Cal Poly is 17-6 for a reason, and their top three players all had excellent seasons.<br>\nJunior Josh Ortlip finished 14-4 on the season, and gave Moreno de Alboran a run for his money on court one.</p>\n<p>UCSB will have to keep up the way they’ve played during their current eight-game winning streak if they are to extend their season. This has the makings of a team that could be dangerous in the NCAA tournament. First, however, they must get there.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will play their semifinal match on Friday at 3 p.m. at Indian Wells. If they win that match, they will then play in the championship game on Sunday at 9 a.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

\r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the home match against Davis on Friday– senior night for Captain Simon Freund and contributor Chase Masciorini– the Gauchos easily took care of business against an overmatched Aggies squad to get their sixth straight victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following an impassioned speech by Head Coach Marty Davis about the two seniors, the squad came out firing, taking the doubles point as has become the norm during Santa Barbara’s win streak.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Singles play gave UCSB an opportunity to show off their depth, opting to rest freshman Viktor Krustev and allowing Sophomore transfer Joseph Guillin to play at the No.1 spot– traditionally the spot where standout Junior Nicolas Moreno De Alboran dominates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The moves paid off, however, as every single Gaucho went on to win their match, most doing so in only two sets. On court three, Simon Freund finished his senior season unbeaten at home with a 6-1, 6-1 victory over his opponent on court three. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since Freund’s loss to Oregon, he has been playing inspired tennis, winning seven straight singles matches.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Juniors Anders Holm also picked up an easy victory on court four– a good omen for the team going forward considering his struggles earlier in the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On courts five and six, spots that have plagued this team throughout the season, Freshman Joey Rotheram and Junior transfer Hironori Koyanagi also picked up tough-fought victories.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And on court one, Guillin continued his unbelievable season with a two-set victory over his opponent on court one, moving his win total to 17 on the season– a remarkable season for a player who was unsure of his role on the team heading into the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the victory, the Gauchos finish the season 11-0 at home, accomplishing their pre-season goal of finishing the year undefeated at home.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> With their victory over UC Riverside on Sunday, UCSB made their second goal of winning the conference that much easier to accomplish.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The match against Riverside would prove to be a sort of measuring stick for how much Santa Barbara has improved as the season has moved on. The Gauchos had lost their first five road games this season and were up against a much-improved Riverside team that had just set a school record with their 15th win of the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite their improvement, the Highlanders were no match for UCSB, who once again won the match 7-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the biggest storyline of the match occurred on court six, where Masciorini made his season debut after rehabbing an injury for almost an entire season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After already winning the doubles point on court three, Masciorini came out firing in what could possibly be his last ever college tennis match, winning 6-1 in both sets to give the Gauchos an early lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite opting to rest Moreno de Alboran for the match, Santa Barbara still displayed the dominant brand of tennis they have become so accustomed to as of late. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guillin once again picked up a dominant victory on court one, even blanking his opponent in the second set. After moving all the way up to court three, Koyanagi was still able to pick up a two-set victory over an opponent who had already accumulated 21 wins on the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The Gauchos will need Koyanagi to keep that up if they hope to win the conference, and even potentially make noise at the NCAA tournament.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos now have the most important match of their season on Saturday, taking on a Cal Poly team that is also 4-0 in the conference and 17-5 overall on the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The match will be winner-take-all for the regular season Big West title, and will also determine the top two seeds for the Big West tournament.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

Winner takes the regular season conference title and the top seed in the Big West tournament, while the loser must settle for the second seed.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I feel we’re beginning to peak at the right time, with all of our biggest matches in front of us,” Gaucho Head Coach Marty Davis said.</p>\n<p>Last season, the Mustangs finished ranked No. 49 after an 18-8 season, the most wins in school history. With a victory over the Gauchos, the Mustangs would tie that record, putting their overall record at 18-5 heading into the Big West tournament.</p>\n<p>Statistically, Cal Poly seems to have a strong advantage playing at home — on the season, they are 11-0 at home, while UCSB is only 3-5 on the road. However, most of those losses came earlier in the season, when Santa Barbara was struggling to find its identity. Additionally, UCSB holds the all-time record against Cal Poly, winning 19 of the 32 matches the two sides have played.</p>\n<p>“I’m interested to see how we play in front of a hostile environment,” Davis said. “I know we’re going to be up for the test.”</p>\n<p>In order to mitigate home-court advantage, Santa Barbara will have to win the doubles point — something that hasn’t been Cal Poly’s strong suit this season, particularly at the No. 1 spot. On the season, the Mustangs are just 7-9 at that spot; therefore, juniors Nicolas Moreno de Alboran and Anders Holm will look to pick up one of the two victories necessary for the doubles point.</p>\n<p>Similar to the Gauchos, the Mustangs are a top-heavy squad when it comes to singles play. Junior Josh Ortlip has dominated opponents at the one spot, winning 14 of his 18 matches and riding a four-game winning streak heading into the match. Moreno de Alboran, who remains unbeaten in his last seven matches and is ranked 80th in the country, will have to be on his A-game in order to get the victory.</p>\n<p>Likewise, Australian junior Dominic Bechard has won 11 of his 13 matches on court two, posing a threat to UCSB sophomore Joseph Guillin, who has only lost two matches the entire season. The top two courts will likely be the deciding factor on Saturday, so Guillin will have to keep his hot hand if the Gauchos are to win.</p>\n<p>Where the Mustangs have stumbled, however, is at the bottom two singles courts. On court five, Cal Poly has a 9-9 record on the season, while on court six they are 10-7. These numbers pale in comparison to the team’s overall record, and will likely provide the Gauchos’ best opportunity to pick up points.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB has also been inconsistent, especially at the number six position. On court five, freshman Victor Krustev has stepped up despite his age, winning his last two matches in straight sets. What remains to be seen, however, is who will play at the number six position for UCSB. After struggling earlier in the year, junior Hironori Koyanagi dominated in his last match, while senior Chase Masciorini picked up an easy victory on court six following a one year layoff of playing tennis. No matter who plays, Santa Barbara will need those points in order to have a cushion if their top players slip up.</p>\n<p>There’s no doubt UCSB has the talent to keep up with Cal Poly — they’ve proved that all year. On the road, with the regular season title on the line, they will need to display that talent — along with the poise and confidence they’ve had of late — in order to celebrate a title in SLO.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will take on Cal Poly at 10 a.m. on Saturday at the Mustang Courts.</p>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\">\n<div id=\":8tg\" class=\"ajR\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" data-tooltip=\"Show trimmed content\" aria-label=\"Show trimmed content\"><img class=\"ajT\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 19th</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em><img class=\"ajT\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

After years of grueling practices, waking up early for stadium runs, proving his worth to the coaches, was he going to abandon his first love just like that?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After six months of failed treatments, sheer frustration and mediocre tennis, Masciorini had hit his breaking point.</p>\n<p>As an underclassmen, Masciorini likely would have turned to worldly pleasures to ignore his disdain — partying, drinking, all the “typical college things” he was so well known for on the team.</p>\n<p>But that was the old Masciorini — the one who struggled with fulfillment in his life, who struggled to live up to the immense pressure he placed on himself on the tennis court. Instead, still alone in his car, he closed his eyes and prayed, asking God for advice.</p>\n<p>“I felt like, in that moment, God told me to keep going and persevere, which was hard to hear because it had been five months of struggling and quitting really looked the most appealing,” he said. “At that moment, I made a decision I wasn’t going to let the injury defeat me. I knew neither solution was ideal, but I trusted God that something good would come out of it.”</p>\n<p>Long before that defining moment, before the injury that would plague him for so long, Masciorini was a sophomore struggling to get his chance on the court. He played only one singles match all season, losing on court six, and his partying habits were starting to catch up to him. Discontent, Masciorini knew he needed to change something… he just wasn’t sure what.</p>\n<p>“I realized a lot of what I was doing wasn’t making me happy. The more I did it [party], the more empty I felt and the more stressful the other aspects of my life were,” he said. “I tried focusing on being a better person, but that didn’t change [my habits].”</p>\n<p>Masciorini finally decided to give up all that dissatisfaction in exchange for “peace, joy, happiness.” He decided to turn to</p>\n<p>God, to become a more religious man. Along with gaining a new perspective on life, the decision enabled Masciorini to finally play freely on the court. No longer was he just playing for himself — he was playing for something greater.</p>\n<p>“It took all the pressure off… I no longer felt like my failures defined me, so now I was just stoked to get to play tennis,” he said.</p>\n<p>That change proved to be fruitful on the court. Without the added burden on himself, Masciorini developed into one of the team’s most consistent contributors, developing a niche for himself at the number six spot. At that spot, he won 10 of his 15 matches on the season, helping the team to their third straight conference title.</p>\n<p>Still, something just felt a little bit off.</p>\n<p>At the advice of the trainers, Masciorini took a few weeks off from playing tennis after the season ended in hopes of letting his injury heal naturally. But when he came back, the hip just felt worse.</p>\n<p>“The hip was way more tight when I came back, so I decided to take another three weeks off to do physical therapy,” he said. “I ended up not playing tennis for a month and a half after the injury.”</p>\n<p>His frustration started to mount as the pain refused to go away, ultimately culminating during that fateful December day.</p>\n<p>After God told him to persevere, Masciorini decided to get a CT scan on his injury. That scan revealed inflammation in his SI joint, a joint he had completely ignored in his rehabilitation efforts.</p>\n<p>“It was frustrating because I knew with the right diagnosis in the first place I could have been back in fall,” Masciorini said.</p>\n<p>Now, Masciorini was in a race against the clock. On Jan. 13, just before the team’s first regular season match, he resumed practicing — his first fully healthy practice in more than six months. He knew he wouldn’t be able to contribute on the court for the majority of the season, his last in a UCSB uniform. Instead, he made a decision: he would do everything he could to help the team, no matter how unorthodox.</p>\n<p>“We have a policy here: team first,” he said. “I really buy into that concept, so I decided if I can’t contribute in the way that</p>\n<p>I’m used to, then I’m going to do everything in my ability to help us win, whether it be cheering or helping the new guys and the coaches.”</p>\n<p>At first, this proved to be an adjustment for Masciorini; he knew he wanted to help, but had a hard time swallowing his pride. All of last year, Masciorini had only focused on warming up for the match. Suddenly, he was thrust into setting up for the match, a role that freshmen typically perform.</p>\n<p>But as Masciorini became more content with his situation, he began to truly embrace the various roles he would take on.</p>\n<p>Before the first game, Head Coach Marty Davis asked Masciorini if he would DJ and MC the home match, calling out scores and keeping the fans engaged.</p>\n<p>“I remember being really nervous the first time I had to MC the game, speaking into the mic and hearing my own voice,” Masciorini said. “I just try to have fun with it. The guys love it and I realized this is a way I can contribute, helping the team come together.”</p>\n<p>Now Masciorini’s booming voice is synonymous with a home match for the Gauchos, with his electronic interludes between points bringing a sort of energy that has inspired the team to an 11-0 home record.</p>\n<p>Even when he’s not on the mic, Masciorini is making his presence, a sort of presence that exudes confidence and comfort, felt at matches. In the team’s March 3 home match against St Mary’s, Masciorini noticed one of the Gael’s players yelling at the top of his lungs throughout the doubles portion of the match, the sort of volume that would drive a grandparent crazy.</p>\n<p>“Let’s gooooo Simon,” Masciorini yelled out in response, egging on teammate and senior captain Simon Freund. During that match, Masciorini made sure, no matter what, that his voice was heard.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t going to let this guy from the visiting team just be louder than me,” Masciorini said. “I also wanted to show the freshmen not just how to cheer, but also how to have fun with it.”</p>\n<p>During UCSB’s March 14 match against Gonzaga, Masciorini’s constant clapping and support for his teammates irritated the Bulldogs so much that a game official had to come over to warn him about “taunting.” Yet after the game, the Gonzaga team came up to Masciorini to tell him how his cheering had thrown them off their game, helping to establish the home-court advantage that UCSB is renowned for.</p>\n<p>Through it all, Masciorini has kept the promise he told himself — the same statement that God told him — not to give up.</p>\n<p>When he first started practicing, he wasn’t sure he would either fully regain where he had been the season before.</p>\n<p>“I had doubts. Was it really the injury, or did I just lose it?” he said. “It had been five to six months since I had played consistently… maybe I just lost my skill.”</p>\n<p>As he kept working, however, he began to see glimpses of what had made him such a strong player in the past, even if only for moments. Slowly, those glimpses began to morph into full sets, and soon, full matches.</p>\n<p>In a challenge match a few weeks ago, Masciorini found himself against a freshman on the team who had beaten him easily in the fall. After the initial match in fall, Masciorini found Davis’ clipboard, with notes that implied that he would never contribute to the team.</p>\n<p>This match was different from the get-go. Determined to prove that he could compete — that, if given the opportunity, he would win at six — Masciorini came out firing, winning the match easily.</p>\n<p>When Davis came by to check the score, Masciorini had five simple words for him: “Don’t count me out, coach.”</p>\n<p>“That was a defining moment for me,” he said. “I proved that no matter what others thought, I was making the comeback I knew I could, that God knew I could.”</p>\n<p>After a year of helping the team off the court, of sacrificing to help the team no matter how he could, Masciorini finally got his shot against UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>It was just like the old days; Masciorini laced up, working on his forehand, backhand, ensuring his serve was strong. Before he knew it, it was game time.</p>\n<p>“In a lot of ways it felt like it was my first-ever match for UCSB all over again. I was really nervous but mostly excited to be back out there,” he said.</p>\n<p>On the court, Masciorini demonstrated that he still had it, that he could still play at a high level. After helping his team win the doubles point, he dominated his singles opponent, winning in two sets, 6-1, 6-0.</p>\n<p>“It felt like I didn’t miss a beat since my last match at six,” he said. “I played really well, and it felt good that all the hours of rehab payed off.”</p>\n<p>As his time at Santa Barbara comes to a close, Masciorini remembers fondly one question he was asked before he came: What do you want to get out of college tennis?</p>\n<p>When he responded by saying he wanted to leave a legacy, he meant a legacy of awards and records, a legacy of on-court production. While individually that didn’t come to fruition, Masciorini ultimately accomplished his goal.</p>\n<p>He has left a legacy of team success. If the Gauchos win the title, he will be only the second ever player in Santa Barbara history to be on a team that wins four consecutive conference titles.</p>\n<p>He has left a legacy of buying into the team concept, of putting the team first.</p>\n<p>And he has left a legacy of perseverance, a man of faith, a man who refused to give up despite the odds, a legacy that will serve to inspire the freshmen he mentored for years to come.</p>\n<p>Masciorini knows that match may have been his last ever in a Gaucho uniform and knows he may not be called upon to play in the postseason. But as he has done all year, Masciorini won’t complain, won’t grumble, but will do whatever the team needs to be successful. And, if he is called upon, don’t count him out.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.
