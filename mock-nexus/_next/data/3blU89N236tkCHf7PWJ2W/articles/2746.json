Senate met Wednesday night in the UCen’s Flying “A” Room for their weekly senate meeting.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate discussed budget reallocations, A.S. Commission on Student Well-Being (COSWB) funding, Monday’s domestic disturbance and the search for a new Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>A.S. Chief Financial Officer Andre Theus said due to lack of time left this quarter, he would like to override the legal code and pass a bill that would allow the transfer of $10,000 earmarked for “Professional Development” from the A.S. budget to senate unallocated funds.</p>\n<p>“The process is usually [as follows:] I would have to present the idea two weeks out from the time it needs to be done, and that would have to be ratified by Business and Finance by 50 percent plus one,” Theus said. “Because it’s Week Seven that’s not really going to work so I will need you all to essentially override the legal code and approve that.”</p>\n<p>Theus said Professional Development money went untouched by A.S. this year because it was not needed and could be put to better use by the senate to fund events and groups.</p>\n<p>“I think if there was a need for it, it would have been used, but I don’t think there is a need for it in Associated Students,” Theus said. “I know groups that it could help out a lot internally at the end of the year.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate passed the bill authorizing the transfer of the funds that Senate allocated.</p>\n<p>A.S. President said she was pleased with the student government’s prompt communication with the student body following the May 11 Sabado Tarde incident in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“We had a remarkably fast and thorough response because your executive officers were actually meeting at the time of the incident, so we were able to pull together a very quick response,” Guthy said. “I’m very proud of how we handled it. I actually got a lot of administrators and community members thanking students for their involvement, not just executive officers.”</p>\n<p>Guthy also said the search committee for a new Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs is currently deliberating over two final candidates.</p>\n<p>“We have two finalist candidates for the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs position,” Guthy said. “As you all know, this is a very important position because, obviously, they interact the most with students and deal with student life and a lot of the issues that are pertinent to us.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs candidate Monroe Gordon will meet with student representatives on Thursday.</p>\n<p>“One of the candidates will be on campus tomorrow and he will be having a conversation with students starting at 2:30 in the Mosher Alumni House,” Guthy said. “I think a select group of students were invited to that, but, to my knowledge, it’s not a closed meeting.”</p>\n<p>According to Theus, students are not well enough informed about the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs search committee.</p>\n<p>“Students were not consulted ahead of time in designing the interaction that the candidate will have with students,” Theus said. “The current student meeting is private and invite-only.”</p>\n<p>Theus said students should have the opportunity to interact with candidates because the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs is meant to represent students.</p>\n<p>“There should be an open space where students can meet this person or persons,” Theus said. “This is a very important position for students and we’re sidelined. At least the students on the search committee should be able to observe the candidate while they meet with deans and admin to see how they are as an ally behind closed doors.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Mental Health Coordinator Alex Hill said he is concerned regarding inappropriate spending by COSWB beginning in 2013.</p>\n<p>“Essentially there is a history of inappropriate spending with student fees,” Hill said. “I think there’s some serious misuse of funds. They may not be intentional, but it’s occurring, and you can see it started in 2013.”</p>\n<p>Hill said, despite a $2,500 allocation to advertising, the money is not being used efficiently and COSWB has not been responsive to his inquires about inefficient funding. According to a document Hill shared with the senate, COSWB paid $6,000 for T-shirts and $295 for a tablecloth in the past year.</p>\n<p>“They’re essentially spending vast amounts of money on advertising without any actual function,” Hill said. “They are not providing the services they should be in comparison to the funds they have.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate then moved on to debate the legitimacy of the Bill to Outline a Procedure for the Review of the Executive Branch Expenditures, and whether the bill overstepped certain powers.</p>\n<p>Senator and second-year history of public policy major Cassie Mancini said she supports the bill because it requires the executive branch to follow the same rules as other A.S. organizations.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t overstep [of authority] because we’re not actually approving or disapproving … we’re just having [expenditures] reviewed,” Mancini said. “They would have to submit their minutes to us and their expenditures before they spend the money, like any other A.S. agency.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator and third-year student Michelle Moreh said the bill is problematic because excessive control of the executive office would result in inefficient financial delegations.</p>\n<p>“From what I understand, I still see it as an overstep. They would have to wait for a whole week for us to approve their spending,” Moreh said. “As we know, things move really fast within the association. If the executive officer needs to move those funds in the time frame of that week and he can’t do it within decent time, that causes problems.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate ultimately passed the Bill to Outline a Procedure for the Review of the Executive Branch Expenditures by a 17-2-0 vote.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the Thursday, May

felt they had a voice in these important issues and establish a mechanism for us to share information to the students about what is happening in this area,” UC Systemwide Title IX Coordinator Kathleen Salvaty wrote in an email.</p>\n<p>The board will consist of one undergraduate and one graduate student from each UC campus, making a total of 19 board members. <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/KP3WLYN\">Applications</a> are due on Thursday, Nov. 30 at 5 p.m., and the selected board members will receive news of their acceptance in January.</p>\n<p>Board members will serve for one year with the exception of board members chosen in January, who will serve a year and a half term.</p>\n<p>According to Associated Students (A.S.) President Hieu Le, he and other stakeholders worked with Salvaty and Title IX Program Coordinator Evelyn Cheng to create the board.</p>\n<p>He added that SAB members will be able to hold decision-makers accountable, as they will be involved in the “procedures, implementation and enforcement of both Title IX and the UC Policy on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence.”</p>\n<p>Le said he was involved in discussing the board’s duties and the qualifications for those who will serve.

all first-years were rerouted beginning Fall 2016.</p>\n<p>Courses are still offered for the old program, but students entering the department are pushed towards earning a more biology-based degree.</p>\n<p>Classes in chemistry and biology are now prerequisites for earning a Bachelor of Science degree in psychological and brain sciences, as well as biopsychology.</p>\n<p>The department allowed transfer students to declare the Bachelor of Arts in psychology for a year longer than other students due to the different prerequisites they had to compete at community college.</p>\n<p>UCSB is the first UC campus to only offer the Bachelor of Science degree.</p>\n<p>According to the psychology department chair Diane Mackie, modern psychology is more aligned with biology and other science, technology, engineering and math (S.T.E.M.) fields. The changes to the psychology degree are a “reflection” of how the discipline has developed in recent years, she said.</p>\n<p>“The change in degree is meant to benefit students, giving them a competitive edge in their further studies, careers and research,” Mackie said. “We wanted to create a new degree more biologically based and rooted in science.”</p>\n<p>The biology courses offered for the psychology department are different than the courses offered for the biology major, she said.</p>\n<p>Mackie said the old degree did not provide adequate training for modern psychology. The changes were not prompted by financial issues. The current psychology and brain sciences faculty are experts in the biological side of psychology, so the university won’t need to hire new professors.</p>\n<p>Some first-year students, however, are wary of the changes.</p>\n<p>Kellie Stahlhuth, a first-year undeclared major, said she planned to get a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology at UCSB and pursue a career in psychology after graduation, but is now unsure if the offered Bachelor of Science degree is the best way to achieve her goals.</p>\n<p>“The other UC campuses and most other universities in California still have a psychology B.A., in addition to the fact that it was a popular degree [at UCSB],” she said.</p>\n<p>However, Carly Wilcox, a fourth-year psychology major, said as she nears the end of her time at UCSB, she would have appreciated a Bachelor of Science degree to diversify her classes.</p>\n<p>“I would have liked the B.S. when I was an incoming freshman personally… but it might be nice if the department offered both,” Wilcox said. “I took Statistics and Math 34A, but other than that the classes for my major have been strictly psych classes.”</p>\n<p>When the old degree was still in effect, the department received approximately 300 applications per year from incoming freshmen seeking a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology.</p>\n<p>This past fall, there were approximately 200 freshman applicants to the new Bachelor of Science degree.</p>\n<p>Mackie recommends all psychology majors, even those who may not be as S.T.E.M.-oriented as others, to still pursue the Bachelor of Science degree because they will receive a more well-rounded psychology education.</p>\n<p>Mackie said students planning on pursuing a career in clinical psychology are given the education they need, while also benefiting students seeking work in medical and research fields.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 12, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79095\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsb-first-uc-to-remove-bachelor-of-arts-in-psychology/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79095\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsb-first-uc-to-remove-bachelor-of-arts-in-psychology/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsb-first-uc-to-remove-bachelor-of-arts-in-psychology/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsb-first-uc-to-remove-bachelor-of-arts-in-psychology/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsb-first-uc-to-remove-bachelor-of-arts-in-psychology/","id":2744,"author":{"id":177,"name":"Kayla Larson"},"related":[2743,2742,2741],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Event Discusses Combating I.V.

Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The MultiCultural Center (MCC) and English professor Felice Blake hosted a remembrance event on Tuesday in the MCC to create a healing space for students, staff and faculty affected by the events of May 23, 2014.</p>\n<p>Attendees discussed ways to combat racism and sexism in Isla Vista in context of the anniversary of the shooting. The event was facilitated by third-year film major Ashley Baker, who led group activities with Blake and encouraged participants to express their emotions and acknowledge words of healing such as “faith,” “hope” and “power,” as well as words that reflect wounds such as “fear,” “anger,” and “alone.” Blake focused on community building and different resources and systems of support for those who have gone through difficult experiences.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Even if we want to take up issues of race or sexuality, we realize that we don’t all experience these things in the same way.</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Blake, increasing police presence and surveillance as a response to the events of May 23 last year has exacerbated the pre-existing tensions between students of color and law enforcement, specifically issues of profiling and biased arrests.</p>\n<p>“Even while these students [of color] believe that safety is a pressing concern, we don’t automatically share the same ideas of safety and security and protection just because we happen to be affiliated with UCSB,” Blake said. “Even if we want to take up issues of race or sexuality, we realize that we don’t all experience these things in the same way.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Womyn’s Commission’s supporting chair and third-year comparative literature and global studies double major Cassie Rubio said administrators reacted to the events of May 23 last year incorrectly. According to Rubio, administrators increased policing while failing to address the roots of the problem, sexism and racism.</p>\n<p>“The increased militant police presence that we now have … is really harmful to communities of color, women, other marginalized groups who have histories with police presence,” Rubio said. “What has not changed is the administration’s failure and blatant erasure of misogyny and racism and serious issues that we need to deal with on our campus. We need more healing spaces that are more focused and informed of these issues.”</p>\n<p>Several attendees recounted their experiences entering the university last fall, expressing they expected an open and loving environment but were faced instead with sexism and racism. One attendee described UCSB’s environment as “disappointing” due to the prevalence of student-filed sexual assault cases.</p>\n<p>Participants used the space to discuss their individual emotions about the events of May 23 last year, describe memories and offer advice for those experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder and other lasting effects.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Response Network Operations team leader Anthony Rodriguez said students experiencing trauma should recognize there are others who care and many who feel the same way. According to Rodriguez, students have the ability to strengthen Isla Vista through unity.</p>\n<p>“Know that you are not alone, whatever you are feeling — no one can change that,” Rodriguez said. “But there’s so much to do to empower your community. I.V. is not alone. You guys have heart and that’s a good thing.”</p>\n<p>Director of the MCC Zaveeni Khan-Marcus said UCSB should increase representative conversations because, while the events of May 23 last year were shared experiences for the entire student body, they affect individuals differently.</p>\n<p>“[We discussed] the sense of isolation and loneliness that impedes us from creating a community and trying to help each other,” Khan-Marcus said. “Of course everyone came together during the tragedy but two years from now, one will not have a common thread. And then how do we love?”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Know that you are not alone, whatever you are feeling — no one can change that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Baker said she is pleased to see how rapidly the campus has grown in the past year.</p>\n<p>“Just seeing the campus grow from last year to this year has been pretty phenomenal,” Baker said. “Of course it’s still going to have its cold spaces. I just see how precious life is and I don’t want to waste a minute of it. Even if it’s scary, I try to push myself to do things I don’t normally do.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63621\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/event-discusses-combating-i-v-racism-sexism/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63621\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/event-discusses-combating-i-v-racism-sexism/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/event-discusses-combating-i-v-racism-sexism/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/event-discusses-combating-i-v-racism-sexism/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/event-discusses-combating-i-v-racism-sexism/","id":2745,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2744,2743,2742],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
