We worry more about a players’ rings than we do his play. We care more about their endorsement deals than we do their actions outside their respective sport such as charity work.</p>\n<p>And most importantly, too many times, we forget the emotions that go into that respective sport.</p>\n<p>Clippers point guard Austin Rivers reminded everyone last night of the real beauty of sports: the heart these athletes display while putting their bodies on the line game after game for one thing: victory.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>At around the 6:50 mark of the first quarter, Portland Trailblazers forward Al-Farouq Aminu unintentionally elbowed Rivers in the eye. He was on the floor bleeding, his eye was badly bruised, and he was immediately taken to the locker room.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-vine\" style=\"display: block;\"><iframe class=\"vine-embed\" src=\"https://vine.co/v/iPT7jlHKwQt/embed/simple\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Nobody would have blamed him if he did not go back in. Essentially, the Clippers season was over when the news broke that Chris Paul and Blake Griffin were out the rest of the series.</p>\n<p>No one had any hopes of them salvaging the series and no one believed Rivers could actually make a difference.</p>\n<p>Austin has had a difficult time earning respect in the NBA. As the former 10<sup>th</sup> overall pick, he displayed one of the worst rookie seasons by any lottery pick. The former Blue Devil was laughed at even more when his dad — Clippers Head Coach Doc Rivers — traded for him.</p>\n<p>He became a punchline for a lot of people. Not only was he a massive underachiever, but now the only coach that wants him is his dad. As you could imagine, Rivers has not had an easy career and it certainly did not get any better after going to L.A.</p>\n<p>But none of that mattered last night. Rivers was not trying to salvage his career. He was not trying to please his father. No … he was trying to do something much, much simpler: win a game for his team.</p>\n<p>What the former Duke point guard displayed was not for the “haters,” the nay-sayers, the critics or even his own father, rather, it was all for his teammates — especially Jamal Crawford — who did believe in him and knew he had it in him to make a difference.</p>\n<p>After receiving 11 stitches under his left eye, Rivers came back and certainly made his presence felt finishing the game with 21 points, eight assists, six rebounds and zero turnovers.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-vine\" style=\"display: block;\"><iframe class=\"vine-embed\" src=\"https://vine.co/v/iPtnn5hr0lv/embed/simple\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Unfortunately for him and his team, Crawford’s final chance to tie the game came up short, and the season was over.</p>\n<p>If his play did not earn him respect, his post-game interview sure did. An emotional point guard went up to the stage and what we saw was a truly authentic display of emotion from a player who truly left it all out on the court.</p>\n<p>With his eye battered, bruised and bleeding, Rivers led his team and literally bled for them to try to win a playoff game to keep their hopes alive.</p>\n<p>That is the stuff that earns you respect from all-around the league. From twitter to the people on the court, many people will never look at Austin the same and he earned that.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70532\" style=\"width: 315px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70532\" data-attachment-id=\"70532\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-30/rivers-performance-exemplifies-why-we-love-sports/nba-playoffs-los-angeles-clippers-at-portland-trail-blazers/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"NBA: Playoffs-Los Angeles Clippers at Portland Trail Blazers\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-70532\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?resize=305%2C191\" alt=\"Damian Lillard praising Rivers for his performance Courtesy of Troy Wayrynen-USA TODAY Sports\" width=\"305\" height=\"191\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-70532\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Damian Lillard praising Rivers for his performance. Courtesy of Troy Wayrynen-USA TODAY Sports</p></div>\n<p>And that is what sports is all about.

Debating Top 10 lists and different players in different eras can be fun and a great way to pass some time but seeing Rivers go out there, and show us his true heart which nearly willed his team to victory; That is why we love sports.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Speakers at the recital included Margo Halsted, former UCSB university carillonist; John Majewski, UCSB dean of humanities and fine arts and Nick Masuda, director of news at the Santa Barbara News-Press.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The structure and the instrument resting within the tower were both gifts from the late Thomas M. Storke, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and owner of the Santa Barbara News-Press for 32 years. During the dedication ceremony on Sept. 28, 1969, he stated: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is my hope that the publications coming from this building will be the finest examples of journalism developed on any campus in America — perhaps in the world.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the five decades since, the KCSB-FM radio station, La Cumbre yearbook and the Daily Nexus have made their homes at the base of the tower.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honoring this amount of history was no small task. According to Arai, almost a year was spent preparing for the semicentennial: “The thing that took the longest was to work with the two composers we commissioned to write new pieces for the event. I would say the resulting two pieces are one of the major successes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Golden Sounds,” by UCSB Professor Emeritus Emma Lou Diemer, was one of those pieces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I sat at the piano and held down the sustaining pedal to simulate the prolonged sounds of the carillon,” she wrote in an email, “and proceeded to write a piece that incorporated three different melodic elements and other musical ideas that are effective on the carillon.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second piece was “Fantasy on FIAT LUX” by world-renowned composer Aaron David Miller, which featured variations on the university motto “Fiat Lux” by the late Carl Zytowski, who was a UCSB professor of Music music for 44 years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Each letter of the motto spells out a musical theme which became the compositional material for the fantasy,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additional pieces included “Piece Without Expression No. 1” by Frank Percival Price, “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring” by Johann Sebastian Bach and “Fandango” by Ronald Barnes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The instrument that made all of these performances possible was the carillon atop Storke Tower, which contains 61 bells and is one of only six such installations in California. It is played with fists and feet that strike a set of wooden keys each corresponding to a specific bell: the heavier the strike, the louder the sound.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The largest, lowest bells weigh up to 2.5 tons, while the smallest, highest ones can weigh as little as 13 pounds, so you need to be careful with the balance and not let the low bells totally bury the high bells,” Arai said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In principle, this is not too different from how someone would play a piano or an organ, but the similarities end there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes there’s a bit of trial and error, where something I arrange just ends up being impossible to play or doesn’t sound good on the bells and I need to rework it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these challenges, Arai, Diemer and Miller all agreed that the experience of playing a carillon is worth the learning curve, especially given the sweeping view of campus and the Pacific Ocean from atop Storke Tower.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is good to see and hear beyond and within one’s self,” Diemer wrote, and “it’s fun and exciting to create sounds with those 61 bells.” Miller invoked the concept of fun as well, writing that “I don’t know of another instrument you work up a sweat while playing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You’re by yourself, high up in the tower when you play, far away from any listeners,” and “at least for me, this can actually make performing somewhat relaxing, unlike if you were performing on a stage where you can see your audience staring at you,” Arai added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, more than the performance itself, and true to Storke Tower’s tradition of learning and community expression, passing on the knowledge of the carillon is the best perk that comes with playing it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a bit more than just ringing the bells,” Arai said. Every quarter, he trains three students on how to play the carillon. “I think this is the most rewarding part, getting to work with enthusiastic, talented students and teaching them this very unique art.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diemer agreed. “It all comes together sometimes: people, music, memories, creating, learning, never giving up, using one’s talents and perfecting them as much as possible, cherishing the marvelous gift of life, being thankful for all of that. But learning is probably the most important. Isla Vista is full of people who are doing just that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the event may be over, the celebration and education continue. The next carillon recitals will be held on Nov. 17 at 11 a.m. and Nov. 24 at 10 a.m. in front of Storke Tower. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

id=\"caption-attachment-67162\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The reference desk was merged with the services desk. <em>Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reference desk, previously 30 feet away from the library’s mountain side entrance, was removed on Sept. 14 and merged with the services desk by the Paseo West entrance; while this may be a new change to the UCSB community, Library </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communications &amp; Marketing Manager Hannah Rael believes that it isn’t an outdated practice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reference desk removals at libraries [have] been a trend for more than a decade,” Rael said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, library reference desks are desks that professional librarians sit at to help direct students to what they are looking to find. But due to internet advances and other technical innovations that allow users to access information in a handful of seconds, libraries have had to rethink the ways in which they make directional and reference information easily accessible to students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Rebecca Metzger, associate university librarian for research, the merging of</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the reference desk and services desk is the culmination of a three year-long planning process involving the strategic review and redesign of the library’s frontline service model. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During those [three] years, we gathered data, held facilitated discussions with reference librarians and staff, introduced an online system for booking reference appointments and experimented with different hours and staffing models,” Metzger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brightspot, a strategy firm dedicated to collaborating with universities and other institutions in order to improve student services based on technological shifts and social changes, was brought in to assist library staff with the redesign to better serve users of the library. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We worked with [Brightstop] for two months, guided by a steering committee in the library. Two open town halls were held for library staff, and Brightspot led multiple additional focus groups to gain input,” Metzger said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Metzger explained that the ultimate goal was to provide library visitors with a well-structured experience. Formerly, each desk was managed by a different library department and staff went through distinct training programs. Now that the desks are merged, all desk staff will have the same consistent service training and be able to provide users with answers to whatever questions they may have. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We wanted to improve the user experience and service consistency. In the past, it wasn’t obvious which desk to start at. Students would sometimes get bounced back and forth between the two desks to get the answers they needed,” Metzger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, as reported by the </span><a href=\"https://www.arl.org/arl-statistics-survey-statistical-trends/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Association of Research Libraries</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there has been an 84% decrease in reference questions within the past twenty years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Metzger, only one-third of the questions asked at the Davidson Library’s reference desk were reference-related questions. By removing librarians from the reference desk, their time is no longer spent addressing basic questions that can instead be answered by trained staff and students at the service desk. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, this merge allows the library to make more effective use of its resources, Metzger stressed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were investing in duplicative staffing by having student assistants and staff on the reference desk and services desk only 30 feet apart at the same time,” Metzger said. “Our data shows us that the same types of questions were being asked at each desk, [and] by streamlining our staffing, we are able to continue to invest in other projects that improve the library.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the services desk now takes on reference-related matters, it still maintains many of its old functions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The services desk continues to be the spot for checking out books, media, course reserves, interlibrary loans, laptops and other materials,” Metzger said. “In fact, you can now also check out calculators, phone chargers, bike locks, board games and frisbees.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Library users are encouraged to submit their feedback via the library’s online s</span><a href=\"https://www.library.ucsb.edu/suggestions.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uggestion box</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, said Metzger. Alongside a handful of students submitting feedback saying that they miss the reference desk, library staff have also had to grow accustomed to these changes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Library staff are still learning how to provide service in the merged environment so there may be some growing pains, but they are deeply committed to providing quality service to our UCSB community,” Metzger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, the library is currently in a transition period as it has moved on to revamp its service training program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are monitoring how [the training program] is going and are open to making tweaks as we learn more. The truth is that we live in a fast-paced environment where library services have the potential to change regularly based on trends, user behavior and input and data,” Metzger said.</span></p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-90634\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program is designed to help international students find their way around UCSB. </span><em>Sam Rankin/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashley Rifkin, a program coordinator at the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), said over email that the program is designed to help international students find their way around UCSB, “creating opportunities for both international and domestic students and staff to build friendships, share cultures, and developing critical 21st century cross-cultural communication skills in a welcoming and supportive small-group setting.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The OISS staff anticipates roughly 133 mentors and mentees in total for this fall quarter. The office plans to put on events throughout the year for mentorship pairings, but the goal for the program is for the pairs to find and share commonalities in their free time as well, Rifkin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It takes a great deal of courage to leave your family and friends behind to pursue their academic aspirations,” Rifkin said. “The Global Ambassador Program tries to ensure that our international students feel welcome and included.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mission of OISS is to “cultivate an inclusive environment which supports international students academically, professionally and personally by providing holistic advising on immigration, employment and cultural matters</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” according to its website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The staff and advisors at OISS recognize that international students often have difficulty making friends and can feel uncomfortable sharing their culture, Rifkin said, and added that similar programs have found success at universities like UC Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opportunity to mentor also gives experienced UCSB students the opportunity to gain important skills in an increasingly global world, Rifkin explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This holds true with Lauren McKnight, a third-year biochemistry major who was a tour guide for international students over the summer who said she wanted to continue cultivating those relationships during the school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having grown up in southern California, I’ve always been really familiar with the culture in California and the U.S. By getting to know my mentees and other international students, I get to see a little bit more of their perspective of the environment here,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McKnight added that the Global Ambassador Program not only creates an easier transition for international students but overall increases campus diversity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annie Joost, a global ambassador and fourth-year global studies major, said she has cultivated friendships that extend beyond the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We also have a great line of communication through [Snapchat] and WhatsApp. We try to meet [up] just to study, or if one of us is just hanging out in IV we try to let the group know that they can join us!” Joost said over email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am hoping to build some great friendships and to learn more about the different cultures within my group,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another mentor, Jordan Kaiser, fourth-year global studies major, said she understood the difficulty of trying to cross a cultural barrier from her time studying abroad in Berlin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wished I had a program like this when I was abroad. I often felt confused or lost when I was abroad and had a hard time breaking out of my ‘American bubble,’” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Rifkin, the program not only benefits international students but also the ambassadors who learn to view the world through a “different cultural lens,” particularly those interested in working in an international field or studying abroad.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As international educators we recognize that global exchange is a two-way street,” Rifkin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB’s domestic students and staff stand to learn just as much as from our international students and scholars as they do from joining our campus community.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90627\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-26/global-ambassador-program-helps-international-students-adjust-to-life-at-university/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90627\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-26/global-ambassador-program-helps-international-students-adjust-to-life-at-university/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-26/global-ambassador-program-helps-international-students-adjust-to-life-at-university/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-26/global-ambassador-program-helps-international-students-adjust-to-life-at-university/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-26/global-ambassador-program-helps-international-students-adjust-to-life-at-university/","id":1955,"author":{"id":20,"name":"Chloe Kimmel"},"related":[1954,1953,1952],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
