police officers opened fire on activists after a bomb exploded during the protest.</p>\n<p>May Day protests are sometimes marked by violence, as seen in Seattle on Sunday when protestors threw Molotov cocktails and rocks at police, causing injuries and arrests.</p>\n<p>At UCSB, the small rally remained peaceful and served as a platform for students and unionizers to highlight their work.</p>\n<p>Since the 1880s, May Day is shared with International Workers’ Day because of worldwide labor movements that arose amid the call for fair working conditions.</p>\n<p>Aviva Milner-Brage, organizer for the Union for Postdoctoral Research at the UC, became a labor activist after seeing the unbalanced expectations placed on teaching assistants while serving as one at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“My labor organizing began as a result of working as a teaching assistant and having many students and realizing that my labor was really important to the functioning of the UC,” Milner-Brage said. “The UC works because we do.”</p>\n<p>Erika Ito, USAS member and UCSB alumnus, linked the international movements of solidarity to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2001-01-29/ucsb-removes-sweatshop-products-found-in-bookstores/\">work</a> of UCSB’s USAS organization.</p>\n<p>“Many workers abroad do not have the ability to unionize without facing violence and the possibility of being fired,” Ito said. “At UCSB, USAS is able to speak with Chancellor Yang to phase out of apparel from the UCSB Bookstore that is not complicit with fair labor standards.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70602\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70602\" data-attachment-id=\"70602\"

place to ensure workers’ safety, recounting the collapse of an eight-story building in Dhaka, Bangladesh.</p>\n<p>“Workers complained about the conditions, but nothing was done,” Ito said. “Then, just one day, there was a huge crack in the building that led to a huge catastrophe.”</p>\n<p>Andrew Gabriel Pragin used the rally as a call to action to get more UCSB students to register to vote and voice their concerns.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista is a beautiful place that a lot of people take for granted,” Pragin said. “I encourage you all to get more involved.”</p>\n<p>Milner-Brage saw that her work with the union was the most effective way to help students succeed in their programs and to assess whether they are being fairly compensated.</p>\n<p>“International Workers’ Day in the U.S. gets really downplayed and isn’t really well understood by the general public, so the hope with this event is to draw attention to workers’ rights on our own campus,” Milner-Brage said. “Students are workers, too.”</p>\n<p>Field Representative for the University Council-American Federation of Teachers (AFT) Marcelino Sepulveda closed the event by calling the rally a reclaiming of the labor movement.</p>\n<p>“Just know that you stand in solidarity with movements across this country — movements that are rising up to change the system … to take the power back into the people’s hands,” Sepulveda said. “The future is yours. Thank you for being awake and aware … this is the most important work that we have to do: Fight for democracy.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70613\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/ucsb-students-celebrate-may-day-with-rally-and-teach-in/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70613\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/ucsb-students-celebrate-may-day-with-rally-and-teach-in/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/ucsb-students-celebrate-may-day-with-rally-and-teach-in/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/ucsb-students-celebrate-may-day-with-rally-and-teach-in/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/ucsb-students-celebrate-may-day-with-rally-and-teach-in/","id":2492,"author":{"id":117,"name":"Effie Sklavenitis"},"related":[2491,2490,2489],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":117,"name":"Effie Sklavenitis","biography":"Not available","articles":[2492,2523,2531,2558,2574,2597,2599,2622,2638,2657,3608,3616,3636,3855,3869,4600,4657],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Career Fair To Bring SB Startups to UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Career-Startup-Symposium-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Career-Startup-Symposium-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Entrepreneurs Association (EA) is hosting the first ever Startup Symposium Career Fair on May 4 from 1-4 p.m. in Corwin Pavilion.

Santa Barbara startups will be hiring for job positions and internships within sales, marketing, business development, engineering, human resources and more.</p>\n<p>The UCSB EA President Navjot Brar, fourth-year mechanical engineering major, said the organization expects 500 people to attend throughout the day. After speaking with a previous president of the Cal Poly Entrepreneurs Club, Brar thought a career fair could help UCSB students as well.</p>\n<p>“The Startup Career Fair was just a perfect way to help students … After talking to multiple startups in town, they all voiced their concern that they needed to hire UCSB students. That got me thinking, ‘Well that’s weird, I know a ton of students looking for jobs at UCSB,’” Brar said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Brar, EA “created some hurdles” to ensure that companies will engage with students for immediate hiring rather than simply increase the reach of their company.</p>\n<p>“I always hated going to other career fairs and hearing the big companies tell me to just apply online. These guys want to hire UCSB students immediately and for the summer,” Brar said.</p>\n<p>Currently there are 15 Santa Barbara companies attending: Procore, Appfolio, Invoca, LogicMonitor, Graphiq, BioIQ, cielo24, Aurrion, Impact Radius, Brazyn Life, TrackR, Oniracom, FluidStance, PayJunction and Bitwage.</p>\n<p>Jiana Vargem, EA outreach officer and third-year psychology major, is in the process of completing the Technology Management Program certificate. Vargem will be volunteering as an EA member at the fair but said she will also use the event as an opportunity to network.</p>\n<p>“In January EA put on a Startup competition that is going to become an annual event so I cannot see why this wouldn’t,” Vargem said in an email. “We all are stressing out about graduating and employment, so why not maximize our opportunities for future hire?”</p>\n<p>Josh Barney, Chief Operating Officer for the UCSB EA and third-year statistical science major, will also be attending the event.</p>\n<p>“I have been contacting startup companies local to the Central Coast in order to bring them to the event. I think this will become an annual fair since everyone on our leadership team wants to continue the event for future years. Also the involvement of students in entrepreneurship has never been better,” Barney said in an email.</p>\n<p>Attendees are encouraged to bring a student I.D. or perm number and resume copies.

However, this will not lead to abandoning meat altogether anytime soon. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Veganism is trending in both the food industry and in student requests for more vegan options on the menu, and the dining commons have heeded the call.</p>\n<p>Dining Services Dietitian Danielle Kemp said the increased popularity of plant-based foods has been relatively recent.</p>\n<p>“It’s been in the last few years, but it becomes more and more apparent,” she said in an interview on Tuesday. “I keep getting more stuff in magazines and from manufacturers about products that they’re making.”</p>\n<p>Vegan and vegetarian options have greatly increased within the past seven years, starting with the student-led push for Green Monday in 2009, a couple of years before Kemp started working with UCSB.</p>\n<p>“There was a need from the students for vegan and vegetarian options that probably happened before my time,” she said, adding that this was followed by another push from within the administration itself.</p>\n<p>A few years after the launching of Green Monday, the executive chef of the dining commons headed the development of more vegan and vegetarian entrée options. In one summer, he developed a menu and started tastings for the management staff, creating much of what the dining commons offer today.</p>\n<p>“We offer a vegan and a vegetarian entrée at each dining commons,” Kemp said. “So there are available options, usually all the time.”</p>\n<p>However, the options are never provided at all the commons for any given meal.</p>\n<p>“A student may have to go to a different dining common to find a vegan option,” she said. “So they have to kind of figure out where they need to go depending on who’s serving what.”</p>\n<p>Kemp said although there are not always entrée options available, the design of the menu allows for more flexibility.</p>\n<p>“There are other staples like baked potatoes, sweet potatoes, rice and beans that are offered all the time,” she said. “So you can be pretty creative.”</p>\n<p>Several other sources of inspiration for the food at the dining commons include conferences, magazines and food conventions. These sources serve as tools to keep the staff up to date on health discoveries, new recipes and new products.</p>\n<p>“I do think the plant-based [trend] has been growing,” she said of the current patterns within the food industry.</p>\n<p>Kemp said she is pleased about the trend and about its influence in the dining commons.</p>\n<p>“As a dietitian, you want to incorporate more plant-based foods into your diet,” Kemp said.</p>\n<p>She is sure to add that it is all about balance, and while they are providing more options for vegans, the dining commons will not be abandoning meat anytime soon.</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t say we’re trying to move away from meat,” Kemp said. “We’re trying to give education on why incorporating more plant-based foods into your diet is good.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, April 28, 2016 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The team began to form in November 2015, after which it took almost a year to secure the grant. Because it was his first time applying for such a grant, he said the success of the application was due to the expertise and specialization of the team, many of whom spent years researching before coming together to work on the proposal.</p>\n<p>Padilla estimates that the majority of the money will be used to support the participation of visiting researchers, bringing together a group of experts both nationally and internationally.</p>\n<p>He believes that it is crucial to have a “diverse representation of voices,” since the project is interdisciplinary.</p>\n<p>The money will be allocated toward travel and lodging costs, as well as other expenses necessary to facilitate the meetings.</p>\n<p>The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) awards the National Leadership Grants to support projects that benefit libraries through advances in research and new tools, models and services.</p>\n<p>A press release from IMLS states that out of the 85 preliminary applications that were received, 19 full proposals were invited for further review and only 15 libraries were given grants. IMLS Director Dr. Kathryn K. Matthew said that the “recipients represent the best of the best,” and all the recipients went through a rigorous peer-reviewed process.</p>\n<p>Padilla was inspired to start the project after extensive work with humanities researchers, many of whom were interested in computational analysis. The project supports those who wish to analyze or download hundreds or thousands of documents at a time, as opposed to the traditional online viewing of one document at a time.</p>\n<p>The grant will help fund an initial two-and-a-half-day conference in March or April at UCSB with approximately 30 experts including librarians, researchers, technologists, archivists and museum professionals from various universities.</p>\n<p>Their goal is to identify challenges and suggest possible ways to “prepare access to digital library collections in a way that makes them easier to use” for computational analysis, Padilla said. Questions that need to be addressed include the form the collection should be in and the type of documentation needed to create such a collection.</p>\n<p>This conference will be followed by six conventions, including one with the Digital Library Federation in the next year and a half to refine ideas proposed during the initial meeting and to push forward in the development of the frameworks.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, October 6, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.
