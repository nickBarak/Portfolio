Over the three-day NCCS national tournament the No. 1 seed Gauchos won six games, with 19 goals against the most talented teams in the nation. Five women came home with all-tournament honors, including most valuable player Laura Capparilli and most outstanding keeper Carolyn Upton, who allowed only two goals during the weekend.</p>\n<p>“I knew our road to the championship game was going to be difficult,” Heil said. “The girls faced a gauntlet just to have a chance at a fifth National Championship. But they weren’t just up to the task, they excelled.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos beat an impressive series of teams, including Region I and II season champions University of North Carolina (2-0) and University of Pittsburgh (2-1), as well as Region IV champions University of Texas (3-0), who the Gauchos defeated in the 2010 finals.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In its first game against Texas Christian University (2-0), the team battled nerves and struggled to find a rhythm but second half goals from forward Hayley Raguse and defender Annie Curry, assisted by forward Kara Lai, calmed the women into a more controlled pace.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of us get the pre-game jitters just because it’s nationals and it’s such a big tournament, so it takes a little while to get adjusted,” Curry said.</p>\n<p>The closest challenge to the Gaucho five-peat was Pittsburgh’s 78th minute goal, which forced a 1-1 quarter-final overtime.

The Gauchos beat Colorado State (2-0) and Missouri (2-1) in pool play, and won their first championship flight against Texas State (5-4) in penalty kicks after a scoreless 15 minute overtime period.

Just six minutes into the match, a through ball by Madueno was met with a powerful kick by Silva, giving UCSB the early 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>“It was ripped,” Vom Steeg said about Silva’s goal. “Silva was not only great but was on a different level on the field tonight.”</p>\n<p>Silva’s shot from 12 yards out added to his total of 17 goals on the year.

The goal came on a corner kick set and was Adler’s first of the year.</p>\n<p>“I made a curving run toward the back post and made a header,” Adler said. “One of their players tried to clear it off the line but thankfully it went over.”</p>\n<p>Less than five minutes later, Sarle was able to score on a through ball from Silva, who tallied his team-leading 10th assist of the year.</p>\n<p>“I beat [the defender] around the corner quick,” Sarle said. “He cheated near post and I slipped it by him.”</p>\n<p>Providence was able to draw a foul call within the box during the 83rd minute, allowing Anthony Baumann to deliver a penalty kick to the lower left side of the goal. The strike brought the Gaucho lead down to 3-2, where it would remain for the rest of the match.</p>\n<p>“We lost to a good team,” Providence Head Coach Chaka Daley said. “The way we played in the second half … we should have played that way in the first half.”</p>\n<p>UCSB out-shot the Friars 8-1 in the first half and 16-6 throughout the game. Providence goalkeeper Jhojan Obando recorded seven total saves during the match, and UCSB junior goalie Andre Grandt tallied two stops.</p>\n<p>UCSB advances to the third round of the tournament against Creighton next Sunday, Nov. 27.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43159\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43159\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/","id":1649,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1648,1647,1646],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops Championship vs. UCI","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A muddy night in Irvine seemed even colder for the UCSB men’s soccer team when it was defeated 3-2 in double overtime during the Big West Championship match on Saturday night.

Irvine was able to attack the Gaucho defense and convert on a rebounded ball that bounced off the goalpost before being tapped in by forward Miguel Ibarra.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With the win, Irvine will likely be seeded among the top 16 teams before beginning the NCAA tournament, guaranteeing the Anteaters a first-round bye and home field advantage. UCSB is also likely to gain a high seeding in the NCAA tournament brackets, in large part due to a preseason schedule that yielded victories against Duke (Sept. 2) and Akron (Oct. 5).</p>\n<p>The poor field conditions only worsened as the minutes progressed throughout the game, transforming the once-green pitch into a muddy landscape of potholes and divots.</p>\n<p>“The quality of the surface on the field was not great,” Vom Steeg said. “We played Garza and on his first touch [the ball] bounced up and took away a scoring opportunity for us.”</p>\n<p>UCI was able to get off eight shots during the first half, compared to just four for UCSB, and took a 1-0 lead going into the break. UCSB responded in the 64th minute when physical play inside the goal box led to a penalty kick by Silva, who has scored on two of his three attempts this year.</p>\n<p>“Silva is the best player in the conference,” Vom Steeg said. “He played that way in the biggest game of the year. In my opinion, he’s the offensive MVP of the conference.”</p>\n<p>Silva added to his offensive attack less than five minutes later on a free kick from 23 yards outside of the box. A streaking sophomore forward Dom Sarle was able to corral the ball and touch it into the goal, giving UCSB a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Irvine had multiple opportunities in the second half to tie the score that were interrupted by the play of junior goalkeeper André Grandt. A breakaway by the UC Irvine offense forced Grandt into a one-on-one situation, where he was able to make the save.</p>\n<p>With less than 10 minutes remaining in the game, Grandt again made an influential play for the UCSB defense during a UCI free kick.</p>\n<p>“The shot was right on me and I got both hands on the ball,” Grandt said. “Next thing I know, 3-4 [Irvine] players were all sliding into me. I had both my hands on the ball so it was called a foul.”</p>\n<p>An Irvine throw-in with just two minutes remaining in regulation made its way to the front of the UCSB goal box, where it was successfully headed in by the Anteater offense. The 2-2 tie pushed the game into double overtime where UCI was able to score off of a rebounded shot and win the tournament championship.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42862\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-14/ucsb-drops-championship-uci/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42862\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-14/ucsb-drops-championship-uci/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-14/ucsb-drops-championship-uci/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-14/ucsb-drops-championship-uci/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-14/ucsb-drops-championship-uci/","id":1648,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1647,1646,1645],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Second Seeded Gauchos Set to Kick Off 2010 Postseason","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The No. 10 UCSB men’s soccer team, currently ranked No. 2 in the league, will find itself in a familiar postseason position tonight when it hosts UC Davis in a Big West tournament semifinal match.

This year is the fourth consecutive year the Gauchos have advanced to the Big West playoffs, and now must face a desperate Aggie squad whose hopes for an NCAA tournament berth rely entirely on its performance in the conference tournament.</p>\n<p>“Davis is a team that if they lose, they fall below .500,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “And they wouldn’t be eligible for the postseason [NCAA tournament]. Whenever you play a team [like that] you will always get a different type of game.”</p>\n<p>UC Davis enters the match 9-7-4 overall and with a 5-3-2 mark in league play. UCSB begins the tournament with a 13-5-1 overall record and a 6-4 record in conference, including four straight wins to close out league play.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The first of two matches this season between UCSB and UC Davis was played on UCD’s home field on Oct. 8 and resulted in a 2-1 overtime victory for the Gauchos. During that game, UCSB out-shot the Aggies 21-12, including a 6-4 advantage in shots on goal.</p>\n<p>“We have a high-powered offense,” junior forward Michael Nonni said. “We generate so many chances, it’s ridiculous. If we can put some away in the first half we can play more defensive [in the second half].”</p>\n<p>Davis countered with a goal during the second half, forcing the game to enter extra minutes. Junior forward Sam Garza was able to connect on the game-winning goal in overtime.</p>\n<p>“In overtime what we’ve done all season long is have certain players on our team that are playmakers do something special to win the game,” Vom Steeg said. “We made sure one of those players had the ball.”</p>\n<p>Eleven of UCD’s 18 games this season have gone into extra time. UCSB holds an undefeated 4-0-1 record in overtime this year, while UC Davis has compiled a 4-3-4 mark during extra minutes, including the loss to UCSB.</p>\n<p>Three weeks after the OT win, UCD traveled to Harder Stadium to play the second league match against UCSB. The game ended with a 3-1 Gaucho victory in which Vom Steeg’s offense again held the advantage in shots taken (12-6) and shots on goal (4-2). Two of UCSB’s three goals were scored by senior defender Tim Pontius, including a 61-yard shot from behind the midfield line.</p>\n<p>“We moved the ball well,” Nonni said. “Most of our goals are gonna come off passing, moving and getting behind the defense.”</p>\n<p>UC Davis ended its final two games of the regular season in double overtime 1-1 ties against Cal State Fullerton and UC Riverside. The Aggies have had a strong showing on the road during conference play, with wins coming against Cal Poly, Cal State Northridge and UC Irvine during the regular season.</p>\n<p>“They are dangerous on set pieces and counter-attacks,” Vom Steeg said. “If we can transition well and make sure we win the battle of the 18-yard box, I think we can keep them from scoring.”</p>\n<p>UCSB is currently 8-2-1 at home this season, and has compiled a 16-4-4 overall record against UC Davis. UCD last beat the Gauchos during a regular season game in 2008.</p>\n<p>The winner of tonight’s game will move on to the Big West championship. A match between league-ranked No. 1 UC Irvine and league-ranked No. 4 UC Riverside will determine the opponent for tonight’s victor.</p>\n<p>A two-day break over the weekend was a much needed period of rest for a team that has been subject to injury throughout the season and has played four games through the past 10 days.</p>\n<p>“We were able to gives guys Saturday and Sunday off,” Vom Steeg said. “We got some of our legs back. We should be a fresh team come Wednesday night.”</p>\n<p>Senior midfielder Luis Silva will start tonight’s game as the league leader in goals scored with 15 total on the season. Silva and junior forward Dom Sarle are each tied for first in the Big West in assists with eight apiece.</p>\n<p>Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium. Unlike regular season games, students will be charged a $5 admission at the entrance gates.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42722\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-09/seeded-gauchos-set-kick-2010-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42722\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-09/seeded-gauchos-set-kick-2010-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-09/seeded-gauchos-set-kick-2010-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-09/seeded-gauchos-set-kick-2010-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-09/seeded-gauchos-set-kick-2010-postseason/","id":1647,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1646,1645,1644],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
