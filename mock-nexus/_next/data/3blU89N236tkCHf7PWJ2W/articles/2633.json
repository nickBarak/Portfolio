Bearman also held a Q&amp;A session and signed copies of his most recent book, Drugs Are NOT the Devil’s Tools.  Bearman was a key founder of the Isla Vista Neighborhood Clinic in 1970 and Director of Medical Services for the Santa Barbara Regional Health Authority (SBRHA) for 17 years.</p>\n<p>Bearman began with a 45-minute lecture on the history of  drug consumption,  beginning with Zoroastrian rituals and ending with GW Pharmaceuticals’ 2014 medical trials of Epidiolex, a liquid form of Cannabidiol used to treat epilepsy.</p>\n<p>Bearman said the history of cannabis use can help people understand modern policy and culture surrounding the drug.</p>\n<p>“The reason that history is important is it helps explain why we have this peculiar attitude towards this substance that has a tremendous amount of healing potential,” Bearman said.</p>\n<p>According to Bearman, drug policy in the past has discriminated against African-American, Latino, Chinese, Native American and Irish minority groups, as well as many others.</p>\n<p>Bearman said the word “witch-hunt” stems from Pope Innocent VIII’s Summis desiderantes affectibus in 1484. According to Bearman, the issuance sought to punish midwives (witches) for their use of cannabis to dull childbirth pains, since Church doctrine viewed this practice as heretical.</p>\n<p>“One of the first groups that was discriminated against was where we get the word ‘witch-hunt’ from,” Bearman said. “Witches were midwives and used cannabis to ease the pain of childbirth.”</p>\n<p>Bearman later said hemp was the “oil of the 16th century” due to its use in trans-Atlantic ships’ “sails and rigging,” including those used in the slave trade.<br>\n“Those boats were used for the triangular trade, both sugar, rum and slavery,” said Bearman.</p>\n<p>Bearman said the Founding Fathers, including George Washington, were especially fond of hemp and grew the plant.</p>\n<p>“Washington wrote in his diary that he so hoped he’d get home in time for the hemp harvest since he so particularly enjoyed being there for the burning of the slag,” Bearman said.</p>\n<p>After providing a broad history of drug use, Bearman shifted his focus to the history of cannabis in Western medicine, crediting Dr. Brooke O’Shaughnessy with first reintroducing cannabis to the Western world.</p>\n<p>“Dr. Brooke O’Shaughnessy had been in India, where they’d been using cannabis for at least 3,000 years,” Bearman said. “They’re still using cannabis in India, at least by the poor, as a medicine.”</p>\n<p>After O’Shaughnessy reintroduced cannabis to western medicine, it quickly gained broad popularity with almost 2.5 million doctor’s prescriptions filled in 1928.</p>\n<p>Bearman said the wide use of cannabis as a legal medicine quickly changed due to policies enacted in 1930 by commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics Harry J. Anslinger, serving cotton and nylon corporations’ interests.</p>\n<p>“He was the greatest bureaucrat of all time because he created a problem where it didn’t exist and thus increased his bureaucracy,” Bearman said. “The effort had really nothing to do with marginalizing marijuana — they were aimed at marginalizing hemp.”</p>\n<p>Bearman ended by discussing contemporary medical studies on cannabis and the endocannabinoid system as well as discussing what he calls the “New Paradigm” — the viewpoint that substance abuse should be treated as a medical condition instead of through the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p>“The first modern research on cannabis was having to do with seizures in 1949,” Bearman said. “Cannabis is immensely helpful for cancer patients and in fact it may kill cancer cells.”</p>\n<p>Bearman answered a range of questions, including how cannabis affects driving, “big tobacco’s” possible future role in cannabis production and how a change in drug scheduling would affect cannabis research.</p>\n<p>“What the Department of Transportation says is there’s no relationship between impairment and the level of THC,” Bearman said.</p>\n<p>Bearman said the role of “big tobacco” in marijuana legalization would have a negative effect.</p>\n<p>“I think the odds are 100 percent and it’s bad,” Bearman said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara resident Jarryd Wafer said he enjoyed the talk and was very interested in cannabis’s potential to treat his type I diabetes.</p>\n<p>“I thought it was great learning about the histories associated, where we’re at today and where we’re going with cannabis,” Wafer said.</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Tara Cseresynyac, who works as Dr. Bearman’s personal assistant, said she was happy about the turnout and is looking forward to future lectures.</p>\n<p>“I was impressed by the turn out; I thought there was a great variety of people,” Cseresynyac said. “There were students, professionals — a huge variety of people.”</p>\n<p>In an interview following the lecture, Bearman said he would be open to giving another talk on campus and said he would like to see broader teaching of the endocannabinoid system at universities.</p>\n<p>“I was very pleased with the turnout. I think people were interested — people stuck around, asked good questions and were interested in the information,” Bearman said. “I’d like to see UCSB have a course on the endocannabinoid system.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of the Thursday, November 5, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66163\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/dr-david-bearman-talks-history-uses-of-cannabis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66163\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/dr-david-bearman-talks-history-uses-of-cannabis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/dr-david-bearman-talks-history-uses-of-cannabis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/dr-david-bearman-talks-history-uses-of-cannabis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/dr-david-bearman-talks-history-uses-of-cannabis/","id":2633,"author":{"id":133,"name":"Duncan Calvert"},"related":[2632,2631,2630],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":133,"name":"Duncan Calvert","biography":"Not available","articles":[2575,2633,4595],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"CeCe McDonald Answers Student Questions for Trans Revolution Series","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB Resource Center for Sexual & Gender Diversity hosted a discussion with LGBTQ activist CeCe McDonald on Thursday, Oct. 22 in The Hub as part of its Trans Revolution Series.

McDonald stabbed and killed the man in self-defense, but was sent to a male prison for 19 months, leading to the “Free CeCe” movement. After she was released from prison, McDonald began advocating for LGBTQ rights on a national scale. A documentary film about her prison experience and activist work is scheduled to be released in 2016 and will star Laverne Cox from Orange is the New Black.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year black studies major Sue Aldaram interviewed McDonald, addressing the moment McDonald was forced to defend herself as well as the overall issues of transphobia and racism. McDonald said her attackers were “Neo-Nazi drunk assholes” who yelled slurs at her and accused her of trying to mislead men about her gender.</p>\n<p>“We have the right to be ‘mad black women’ if we choose to be because look at the trauma, look at the oppression, look at the violence that we face on a day to day basis,” McDonald said.</p>\n<p>McDonald said the prosecution argued her attackers’ previous violent history, swastika tattoo and toxicology report did not pertain to the case.</p>\n<p>“[The attacker was] known for beating his partner, who was one of the people there that night who attacked me,” McDonald said.</p>\n<p>McDonald said she did a lot of “meditating and self-reflection” in and out of prison and listens to Beyoncé because it gives her “solitude.” McDonald said she also finds peace in being able to share her story and promote justice for transgender people.</p>\n<p>“Having a voice keeps me grounded,” McDonald said.</p>\n<p>McDonald said reading the books sent to her by supporters while she was in prison, like <em>The New Jim Crow,</em> changed her experience dramatically and made her “question so much.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65719\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1137920179\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66067\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65719\" data-attachment-id=\"65719\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/cece-mcdonald-answers-student-questions-for-trans-revolution-series/mcdonald_riley-esguerra-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1332&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1332\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Riley Esguerra\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1445503321\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"100\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"McDonald_Riley Esguerra-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65719\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Riley Esguerra/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65719\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riley Esguerra/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“The things that we were taught, we internalize and think it’s true,” McDonald said. “When will we be able to give our youth <em>The New Jim Crow</em>?”</p>\n<p>First-year music major Jordan Mitchell said he asked McDonald during a question and answer portion of the talk what intersectional oppression she faced within the black community for being a transgender woman.</p>\n<p>“CeCe McDonald critiques with brutal honesty the intersectionality of trans people of color, the prison industrial complex, religious indoctrination in America,” Mitchell said. “She brings her experiences as a light to influence the minds of young individuals at UCSB. She is a voice that enlightens minds of the revolutionary youth.”</p>\n<p>When asked about her feelings on prison reconstruction, McDonald said “there is no reconstruction.” According to McDonald, America takes ideology and turns it into a law then “deems it criminal.”</p>\n<p>“I’d just destroy the shit,” McDonald said. “I’m definitely an abolitionist.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Ph.D. student in feminist studies Chelsea Jones said McDonald’s lecture thoroughly addressed the topic of the prison industrial complex.</p>\n<p>“She covered all the bases beautifully, connecting the prison industrial complex to capitalism, racism, to transphobia, to basically all of us,” Jones said. “She’s a prison abolitionist and not a reformist, and that distinction is super important because you can’t fix something that is inherently fucked up.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article said the discussion took place on Thursday, October 29 instead of Thursday October 22.

Gutierrez called the abuse of detained LGBTQ undocumented immigrants to Obama’s attention, demanding an end to their deportation. On Thursday, Gutierrez will speak on her continued work campaigning for LGBTQ rights and her role as a founding member of Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ and Latin@ communities.</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Ricardo Uribe said students should attend Gutierrez’s talk because the LGBTQ community is often poorly represented by the media.</p>\n<p>“I figured that it is kind of important to hear the stories and learn the other side about people who are not being spoken about or not being represented in the media in order to learn more about their struggles,” Uribe said.</p>\n<p>First-year computer engineering major Melanie Flandes said Gutierrez is an empowering leader who, by sharing her story and experiences, can motivate others to voice their concerns.</p>\n<p>“There are not a lot of people I feel would stand up to the president like that, and for her to have the courage and the ability to do that really does make a difference because now people are going to feel like their voices are being heard,” Flandes said.</p>\n<p>Flandes said Gutierrez coming to UCSB will empower underrepresented communities on campus.</p>\n<p>“Just seeing and learning about her story and how these issues [have] impacted her life gives hope that a difference can be made,” Flandes said.</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Eriko Spurlock said she will attend Gutierrez’s talk in part because she of how much she learned from hearing LGBTQ activist CeCe McDonald speak in October as part of the Trans Revolution Series.</p>\n<p>“I found that these events were helpful in increasing my understanding for the experiences other marginalized women go through, especially since we all have different struggles that we each face based on different factors,” Spurlock said in an email.</p>\n<p>Spurlock said she thinks students should attend Gutierrez’s lecture to learn more about the issues the LGBTQ community face.</p>\n<p>“I feel this event is important for students to come out to in order to open their eyes and gain more understanding for the society, the constructs we live in, and how the current power dynamics are made to marginalize so many people in collectively various ways,” Spurlock said in an email.</p>\n<p>Spurlock said although the topics of immigration and LGBTQ rights are often discussed separately, it is important to see the connection between the two.</p>\n<p>“Immigration and LGBTQAP+ issues on their own are very important to learn more about and understand, but a lot of people think that these two topics are mutually exclusive when the reality is that everything is connected a lot more than we think they are,” Spurlock said in an email.</p>\n<p>First-year sociology major Gabriela Flores said she is looking forward to hearing Gutierrez speak, especially after seeing Shane Ortega, the first openly transgender soldier in the United States military, speak in October, also a part of the Trans Revolution series.</p>\n<p>“I recently attended the one where Shane Ortega came out to speak about his experience as the first openly trans man in the U.S. military, and since I learned a lot from that event, I decided to attend the next one,” Flores said.</p>\n<p>Flores said students should learn more about marginalized communities and support their fight for equality.</p>\n<p>“People need to start paying attention to things like this because these discrimination crimes are only increasing,” Flores said. “We are hurting people in our community by not fighting by their side or hearing them out.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Tobar was the only journalist the miners granted permission to record the story.</p>\n<p>In an interview preceding the lecture, Tobar said coming from an immigrant, Latino family, he felt like an “outsider” in higher education, which he believes ultimately “served him well” as a journalist and author.</p>\n<p>“I always felt like I didn’t get a great education and I was with all these people who had been really well educated,” Tobar said. “It turned out that those qualities that you have as someone who is an outsider and someone who is maybe more humble, those are great qualities to have when you’re a journalist, because it breaks down the barrier between you and the person you’re interviewing.”</p>\n<p>Tobar said one miner he interviewed said he reflected back on pivotal moments of his life in the moments leading up to his ultimate rescue.</p>\n<p>“One of the men told me ‘As I was going up [the capsule], I saw my life flash before my eyes. I remembered things that happened since I was young; I remembered when I met my wife; I remembered when our kids were born; I remembered when I got married,’” Tobar said.</p>\n<p>According to Tobar, the experience of longing to return home and ultimately escaping the mine was like “rebirth” for the 33 miners.</p>\n<p>“What it became for me was a story about men who want to return home,” Tobar said. “They want to be reborn into the lives they had before, they want to go back home to the routines of family.”</p>\n<p>Tobar said interviewing the miners and understanding what they valued amid the mine cave-in caused him to reflect on his own life.</p>\n<p>“In being trapped, in seeing their own deaths, in that time they have to think, they realize that the best thing about them was all the love they brought into the world and all the love that surrounded them,” Tobar said. “That’s what I’ve learned, and as a result of this project I think I value even more my own life.”</p>\n<p>Tobar said despite his accomplishments as a journalist and author, his greatest pride comes from his family.</p>\n<p>“I have many great things that have happened in my life, but the thing that I am most proud of, the best thing about me is that I’ve been married for 22 years and am a father of three kids.”</p>\n<p>Tobar said family is an “extremely powerful force” during challenges times such as the months the 33 miners spent trapped below ground.</p>\n<p>“The miners are back at home and they are fathers, husbands and providers once again,” Tobar said. “They now have the experience of living through an adventure that has taught them the value of the simple things.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Maria Garcia said she found Tobar’s lecture interesting because she did not previously understand the intensity of what the miners underwent.</p>\n<p>“I felt like I got a personal perspective on what they went through, how they suffered and what they had to go through after they came out. It was a really good lecture and I’m really glad I got to see it,” Garcia said. “And now I’m looking forward to buying the book because of everything he said, it was really interesting.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Itzel Cruz said Tobar’s lecture gave her an “inside perspective” on the miners’ story.</p>\n<p>“Seeing it on television is a completely different version than it being told by the writer itself, who personally interviewed these people, stayed with them and got to know each one of them on a personal level,” Cruz said. “You can identify yourself with the Chilean miners and the writer.”</p>\n<p>First-year journalism major at Santa Barbara City College Logan Keaton said Tobar is a “great speaker,” and the lecture made him consider the miners’ experiences in a more personal way.</p>\n<p>“I was amazed at how he got so close with all the miners,” Keaton said. “The different testimonies and experiences that all the miners had, those were inspiring and sad at times. It puts you into perspective looking at the world and everything. You can’t take anything for granted.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66071\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/award-winning-writer-graces-campbell-hall-to-speak-on-chilean-mining-accident/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66071\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/award-winning-writer-graces-campbell-hall-to-speak-on-chilean-mining-accident/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/award-winning-writer-graces-campbell-hall-to-speak-on-chilean-mining-accident/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/award-winning-writer-graces-campbell-hall-to-speak-on-chilean-mining-accident/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-04/award-winning-writer-graces-campbell-hall-to-speak-on-chilean-mining-accident/","id":2632,"author":{"id":136,"name":"Jessica Aguilar"},"related":[2631,2630,2629],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
