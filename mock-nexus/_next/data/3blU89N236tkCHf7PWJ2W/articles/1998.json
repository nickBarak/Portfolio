Because most universities don’t offer accredited classes taught by professors, students often resort to teaching each other — such as at UC Santa Barbara, where over 650 students are actively learning and teaching each other about blockchain through a club known as Blockchain at UCSB.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89848\" style=\"width: 820px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89848\" data-attachment-id=\"89848\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-21/a-look-inside-ucsbs-blockchain-community/blockchain-new-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/blockchain-new-2.jpg?fit=810%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"810,450\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"blockchain\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/blockchain-new-2.jpg?fit=250%2C139&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/blockchain-new-2.jpg?fit=810%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-89848\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/blockchain-new-2.jpg?resize=810%2C450\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/blockchain-new-2.jpg?w=810&amp;ssl=1 810w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/blockchain-new-2.jpg?resize=250%2C139&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/blockchain-new-2.jpg?resize=768%2C427&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-89848\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The club is focused mainly on “legitimizing” blockchain’s  uses — supply chains, data sharing and property ownership. </span><em>Courtesy of Piergiacomo Palmisani</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the largest organizations on campus, the dynamic of Blockchain at UCSB is similar to most other clubs. Students gather to read papers published in the blockchain field, host invited speakers, attend student-produced lectures and travel to blockchain-related conferences, according to Piergiacomo Palmisani, the club’s incoming president and a graduate student in the Technology Management Program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a lot of people that are interested in learning but are not willing to learn [everything] by themselves. That’s why Blockchain at UCSB exists. We can provide a quality education by teaching [students] all the essentials of this technology,” Palmisani said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a passion for technology is common among all members, reasons for joining the club vary. Some see it as a place where students “can potentially meet their new employers” while others have project ideas and aspirations that could be funded through connections made in the club, Palmisani said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one instance, Palmisani said Blockchain at UCSB connected a project called Reward Stream, designed by third-year computer science major Max Colbert, to investors. Colbert went on to receive $50,000 for the startup after Blockchain at UCSB helped put his project on the map. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The one aspect of blockchain that the club will not support, Palmisani said, is cryptocurrency trading itself. The instant gratification and “quick return” of digital currency is alluring to many, he said, but students in search of investment advice will not find it here.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, the club is focused mainly on “legitimizing” blockchain’s other uses — supply chains, data sharing and property ownership — by drawing more recognition to the industry in hopes of spurring accredited classes down the line, according to Cameron Dennis ‘18, co-founder of Blockchain at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By establishing accredited classes in universities, blockchain may reach those who never knew they had an interest in the technology, Dennis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In doing so, the “talent pipeline” for blockchain professions would have more room to grow, providing employment opportunities at Fortune 500 companies such as Microsoft, IBM and Oracle, which are already investing in the technology, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dennis and Palmisani see the blockchain community as a halfway mark between a club and a classroom, thus bridging the gap between the two.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paramount to Blockchain at UCSB’s achievements is its success in establishing an accredited class dedicated to the technology, Dennis said. This coming fall, the College of Creative Studies will be offering a class about “blockchain development” which students can take for credit — a first at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This class is fulfilling the original mission of what we’re trying to do,” Dennis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will also be receiving support for blockchain-related endeavors through a new initiative launched by a venture capital-backed investment firm called MouseBelt. In August, MouseBelt University, a branch of the firm dedicated to investing in higher education, announced its plans to support UCSB, UC Los Angeles and UC Davis through an “accelerator program,” which entails two planned $500,000 investments for student projects and research funding to be </span><a href=\"https://www.mousebelt.com/blog/mousebelt-university-launches-education-initiative-across-three-uc-campuses/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">split among the three schools</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Ashlie Meredith, university program developer at MouseBelt, UCSB will additionally be receiving a donation to the engineering department and the potential for student project funding in exchange for equity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meredith said UCSB was one of 13 universities that MouseBelt initially worked with on student projects in the past, which made finding a home for the accelerator program easier because the club’s success was already on MouseBelt’s radar. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I engaged in an exploratory effort to talk to as many student organizations as I could in the U.S. and Canada to get the temperature of blockchain at universities, what was going on, who had classes and how established these clubs were,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Blockchain at UCSB] had a lot of partnerships with other organizations, even in Mexico with Blockchain UNAM. They’ve had multiple companies incubate and bring their ideas for potential funding. Even one of our portfolio companies came from one of those investments.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Dennis and Palmisani are both encouraged by MouseBelt’s interest in supporting blockchain-related endeavors at UCSB, and specifically the prospect of student entrepreneurs earning funding, they said there is still work to be done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Palmisani finds that more universities nationwide need to be supportive of an atmosphere where the prospect of educating students about blockchain can become a reality. While investments from venture capital companies are a good sign for UCSB, those opportunities aren’t extended to every school, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What does work, Dennis said, is teaching students in a “grassroots” style. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I go to conferences and I understand what’s happening because I listen to these lectures or presentations. When I’m at a conference, I’ll summarize all the points that seem most important and give a presentation on those points,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By taking home what he learned from conferences, Dennis said he enabled students to keep up with current developments in the professional sphere by teaching them what he learned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, Palmisani said he is looking forward to the upcoming year working with Blockchain at UCSB. Already included on the list of speakers the club will be bringing to campus is Julian Wheatland, former Chief Operating Officer of Cambridge Analytica, which was </span><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/amp-stories/cambridge-analytica-explainer/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">embroiled</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in scandal in early 2018 after millions of users’ information was harvested without consent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With invited speakers, conventions, hackathons and lectures, Palmisani said he embraces the work that needs to be done, despite the heavy load. But it wouldn’t be possible without an affinity for blockchain, his driving force for running the club.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You’ve got to have a lot of passion, otherwise I wouldn’t be doing this. I would just play soccer — my other passion — but I’m not as good as a professional player,” he said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

As all the teams wore gray warm-up shirts saying “MLK,” this day really hit home for one specific team, the Memphis Grizzlies.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A city that first handedly experienced the works of this peace promoter, the Bluff State hosted their 13<sup>th</sup> annual MLK Day matchup. In a packed FedEx Forum Arena with roughly over 18,000 in attendance, Grizzlies fans paid homage to a figure whose leadership permeated the streets of Tennessee.</p>\n<p>In April of 1968, King traveled to Memphis supporting a coalition of African-American workers and their fight for equal working conditions. King was a steady activist for the Memphis Sanitation Strike addressing this poor treatment and racial discrimination clearly to then-city mayor Henry Loeb.</p>\n<p>Following his infamous “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop” speech, King checked into the local Lorraine Hotel, now the National Civil Rights Museum. This was where the abolitionist lived his final days as he was assassinated on April 4, 1968. While King’s death marked the end of the 39-year olds civil activism, to this day his presence lives on for the people of Memphis as well as within the Grizzlies organization.</p>\n<p>Starting guard Tony Allen acknowledged how Dr. King stood for more than just social equality, but also for athletes like himself to continue their passion of sports. “Martin Luther King paved the way for guys like myself to have the opportunity to be around now, Allen told NBA reporter Mark Jones. “It felt good to be honoring [this man] and playing on this day.”</p>\n<p>Grizzly big man Zach Randolph also touched on MLK’s special day stating, “What [King] did for us was to give us freedom, someway or somehow. Racism still exists in this world today, but he was a leader and he showed other African-Americans that they could be anything they wanted to be and they could speak from their heart and live the dream and do the right thing,” Randolph told USA Today. “Nobody can tell you what to do and you believe in yourself.”</p>\n<p>What stood as a regulatory match between two NBA teams spoke volumes to the city of Memphis, a region who shared the memories of Dr. King and his civil quest for freedom. His dream and passions still live on through MLK day.</p>\n<p>His vision has given basketball an essence of peace, the ability to experience the passions and competitive spirit of a sport with others regardless of their ethnicity or skin tone. Dr. King will continue to hold a thriving legacy through the Grizzlies’ classic MLK Day match, giving others, both athletes and NBA fans, the encouragement to “Dream BIG”.</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_67531\" style=\"width: 618px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67531\" data-attachment-id=\"67531\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/mlk-day-prolongs-the-legacy-of-dr-king-and-is-central-to-the-memphis-grizzlies-franchise/dream-big/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/dream-big.png?fit=590%2C358&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"590,358\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"dream big\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/dream-big.png?fit=250%2C152&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/dream-big.png?fit=590%2C358&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-67531\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/dream-big.png?resize=608%2C369\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of fansided.com\" width=\"608\" height=\"369\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/dream-big.png?w=590&amp;ssl=1 590w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/dream-big.png?resize=250%2C152&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67531\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of fansided.com</p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Or will he show up as the 39 year-old whom we’ve seen regress heavily in the past year. Manning will more than likely walk off the gridiron for the last time this Sunday and, win or lose, he will go down as one of the greatest to do it.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, whether he wins or not, his last few seasons in this league were not at all an accurate portrayal of the Manning we have grown to know. He has been stricken with injuries, thrown for all-time lows and was even benched in the same game in which he broke the NFL’s all-time passing record.</p>\n<p>He’s thrown a career low nine TD’s this year, along with his fewest completions, his most picks since 2010, and, for the first time in his career, he didn’t play and start in every game. This is surely not the same Peyton Manning that won five MVPs.</p>\n<p>To make matters worse, Peyton is widely known as being very unsuccessful in the Postseason, with a record of just 13-13 in his 18 seasons and only one Super Bowl win out of three tries.</p>\n<p>Now, with sports being the beautiful and unpredictable animal that it is, we can by no means count this man out. With the incredible receiving options he has around him, Manning could very well come out and have an above average day if he can just tap into what ever talent and youth he has left in the tank. What makes this a tall task are those men in blue on the other side of the ball.</p>\n<p>Carolina is known to have a great defense, especially in their front seven with a player like Luke Kuechly handling the run game very well, but what about those who stop the pass? The Panthers have been blessed to feature what may be the most improved corner in the league this season in Josh Norman, who picked up career bests in every defensive stat this year, excluding tackling. Norman had four picks, three forced fumbles and two defensive TD’s this year, but more importantly he became a truly lock-down corner.</p>\n<p>Robert McClain, Kurt Coleman, Roman Harper, Cortland Finnegan and Teddy Williams join him to make up this very talented secondary that reeled in the most interceptions during the regular season and has allowed the least passes in the playoffs so far.</p>\n<p>When looking at this matchup I truly see the thick of the game coming down to how well Peyton can play against this very talented passing defense. The Broncos have great receiving options in Emmanuel Sanders, Demaryius Thomas, Owen Daniels and Vernon Davis whom will be covered well by a talented Panthers defense that will result in a stalemate.</p>\n<p>The Carolina Panthers will be Super Bowl champions unless Peyton shows up as the great player we have grown up with and makes the super star plays he has been known to make, albeit in the regular season as opposed to on the biggest stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Cam Newton vs. Broncos Defense by Jorge Mercado</strong></p>\n<p>While Peyton Manning and Cam Newton exchanged praises for each other at the Super Bowl 50 media day, one of the many attractions entering Sunday’s game is how well Newton will fair against the Denver Broncos’ defense.</p>\n<p>Entitled is a matchup between one of this season’s best quarterbacks going head-to-head with the NFL’s No.1 defense. Yet, it is no shock that Newton has garnered most of the spotlight thanks to his MVP caliber play this season.</p>\n<p>This season, the Panthers star quarterback set a new career high in passing touchdowns with 35 in the regular season, which tied for second best in the league. He also tied for fifth in the NFL in rushing touchdowns with 10 — the next closest quarterback on the list was Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ rookie QB Jameis Winston with six.</p>\n<p>Last week in the NFC championship game against Arizona, Newton threw for 335 yards and two touchdowns, an encouraging sign that he is still hot heading into the Golden Super Bowl. However, Newton has had his fair share of struggles when facing good defenses this season.</p>\n<p>Although the Panthers dominated the Seahawks for the most part in their divisional matchup, Newton was average, throwing for only 161 yards and rushing for three yards on 11 carries. In Carolina’s only loss of the season in week 16, Newton was pressured immensely by Atlanta, being held to 142 passing yards and 46 rushing yards.</p>\n<p>Point being, when Newton is pressured he starts to play a bit more poorly than usual — as do most quarterbacks. Unfortunately for Newton, this Sunday the former No. 1 overall pick will face off against possibly the best pass rushing defense he has seen in his five-year career.</p>\n<p>The Broncos’ defense has dominated all year long as the No. 1 total defense, No. 1 against the pass and No. 3 against the rush. Most notably, it has been Denver’s pass rush which has been most valuable. In the regular season, the Broncos led the league in sacks with 52.</p>\n<p>Last week, Denver hit the Patriots’ star quarterback Tom Brady 17 times. It was the most the quarterback had been hit in a game this season, including the postseason. Newton has yet to be hit more than six times in any game this season.</p>\n<p>However, just as Newton has never faced a pass rush like the Broncos, subsequently Denver has never faced a quarterback like Cam Newton, which is what makes this matchup so great.</p>\n<p>The most rushing yards by a quarterback against the Broncos was Alex Smith, who ran for 33 yards, but Newton and Smith are two completely different quarterbacks. The unpredictability of Newton’s talents is what might be the determining factor come Sunday afternoon.</p>\n<p>At this point, it seems clear that the Broncos defense holds the advantage. One player cannot possibly beat an entire defense. Then again, not many players, let alone QB’s, can match Cam Newton’s skillset. Part of the intrigue will be to see if he can overcome the best defense in the NFL.</p>\n<p><strong>Broncos Rushing Offense vs. Panthers Front 7 by Elliot Thornton </strong></p>\n<p>They say numbers never lie and as cliché this statement may be, it could well be a recipe for success for Head Coach Gary Kubiak and the Denver Broncos.</p>\n<p>Denver is 8-0 this season when its ground and pound game rushes for 130-plus yards. With the combination of a downhill rusher like C.J. Anderson and the finesse of Ronnie Hillman in the backfield, Kubiak will likely take this stat into account as he helps to prepare the Broncos’ offensive scheme for Super Bowl 50. While the Panthers’ defense, especially their front seven, has been impressive this season, the Broncos know running the ball effectively will play a key part in their ability to move the chains.</p>\n<p>It’s no secret that Peyton Manning’s throwing arm doesn’t possess the same amount of strength and precision it once did. Although he still retains the knowledge and ability to manage a game, the Broncos’ ability to establish their rushing attack will be pivotal in aiding their aging quarterback.</p>\n<p>Despite a lethargic start to begin the season, Denver’s run game gradually improved as the year progressed. Both Hillman and Anderson have proven to be clutch in the post season, coming up huge during the team’s game-winning drive against the Steelers. While Anderson wasn’t as dominant against the Patriots in their second matchup, the former Cal Bear led all rushers with 72 yards, including a rumbling 30-yard pickup in the fourth quarter that set up the game deciding field goal. His hardnosed running style will be a vital factor in the Broncos’ chances of earning a victory in the matchup against the physical front of the Panthers.</p>\n<p>The Panthers’ front seven on defense, led by the All-Pro linebacker duo of Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis, could very well prove to be the deciding factor in this year’s Super Bowl. Kuechly leads the team this postseason with 19 tackles, while Thomas has 11 after leaving the NFC championship game with a broken forearm. While he is planning to play with a brace in the Super Bowl, it remains to be seen how effective he can be with only one fully functioning arm.</p>\n<p>These two linebackers, as well as Kurt Coleman, who leads the team with two interceptions this postseason, headline an aggressive front seven that gave Carson Palmer nightmares during the NFC championship. Fast and intelligent, they will need to be on their toes against Manning and all of his deceptive play calling at the line of scrimmage.</p>\n<p>The Panthers’ defense altered what should have been two hard fought battles this postseason against the Seahawks and Cardinals into near blowout victories with their smart, opportunistic play complementing their explosive offense led by likely MVP Cam Newton.</p>\n<p>Yet enhancing the narrative of Sunday’s game is the curiosity of if the “Sheriff” can dig deep and orchestrate one more victory to top off one of the greatest quarterbacking careers of all time. If Manning can manage to prevent from turning the ball over, the Broncos’ defense might have what it takes to keep Denver within reach for earning its third Super Bowl victory in franchise history.</p>\n<p>However, the edge overall must go to Carolina and its dynamic leader in Newton alongside the Panthers’ ferocious defense, which has taken the league by storm this year with aspirations of becoming the NFL’s next dynasty.</p>\n<p><strong>Broncos Defense/Special Teams vs. Panthers Defense/Special Teams by Ryan Burns</strong></p>\n<p>It’s fairly common that a defensive or special team’s play can end up having a huge impact on the outcome of the Super Bowl. Just ask the Denver Broncos.</p>\n<p>Two years ago in Super Bowl 48, Denver lost 43-8 to Seattle, and a long interception return TD for Seahawks’ Malcolm Smith sucked the hope out of the Broncos in the second quarter. Seahawks wide receiver Percy Harvin delivered the final blow on the kickoff of the second half, returning it 87 yards for a touchdown.</p>\n<p>In this season’s edition of the February classic, two of the premier defenses in the NFL will battle for the crown. Denver definitely comes into the games with the edge, though, as they led the league in the regular season with a stingy 283.1 yards allowed per game and a fourth-best 18.5 points allowed per game.</p>\n<p>Denver’s all-around solid team defense will have to outperform Carolina’s explosive, hard-hitting D led by lockdown cornerback Kurt Coleman and all-pro linebacker Luke Kuechly. The Panthers had a league-high 23 interceptions in the regular season and like their offense, plays with an edge that often gets on the nerves of their opponents. Cornerback Josh Norman has had on-field scraps with several top wide-outs, such as Dez Bryant and Julio Jones, and the frustration has to stem from how tough and gritty the Carolina defense really is.</p>\n<p>As for special teams, neither team has had any explosive players this season, with the Broncos’ Omar Bolden the only player in the Super Bowl with a return touchdown this season. Broncos’ kicker Brandon McManus has hit 85.7 percent of his field goals with a season high 57-yarder, while Panthers’ kicker Graham Gano is similarly successful, converting 83.3 percent of his FGs with a long of 52-yards.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on pages 10 &amp; 11 of February 4, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67895\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/super-bowl-50-key-matchups-defense-wins-championships/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67895\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/super-bowl-50-key-matchups-defense-wins-championships/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/super-bowl-50-key-matchups-defense-wins-championships/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/super-bowl-50-key-matchups-defense-wins-championships/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/super-bowl-50-key-matchups-defense-wins-championships/","id":1997,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[1996,1995,1994],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UC To Divest From Fossil Fuels, But Climate Activists Say This Is Only The First Step","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-09-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Fossil-Fuel-Sit-In-5-10-17-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Fossil-Fuel-Sit-In-5-10-17-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&ssl=1","description":"For climate activists across the UC system, but particularly at UC Santa Barbara, the victory was lauded. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California system will soon divest its money entirely from fossil fuels, two of the UC’s top financial officers announced in an </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-09-16/divestment-fossil-fuel-university-of-california-climate-change\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">op-ed in the Los Angeles Times</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Tuesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For climate activists across the UC system, but particularly at UC Santa Barbara — where Chancellor Henry T.

However, the two acknowledged that some may “see our action as born of political pressure, or as green movement idealism or perhaps political correctness run amok.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So be it,” the two said in the op-ed. “We are part of a university system where diversity of opinion thrives.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have chosen to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invest</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a better planet, and reap the financial rewards for UC, rather than simply </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">divest</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a headline.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But several activists at UCSB, including some of those who were present at the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/chancellor-yang-agrees-to-endorse-3-billion-uc-divestment-from-fossil-fuels-after-72-hour-sit-in/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">72-hour protest</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> held in Cheadle Hall in 2017 by Fossil Free UCSB, said the UC’s decision to divest stemmed from years of student and faculty activism across the campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In particular, they believed a recent vote held by the UC Academic Senates, which found 77% of senate members wished to divest from fossil fuels, was a leading factor as opposed to financial reasons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Ph.D. student Emily Williams, one of the founders of Fossil Free UC and a part of the Cheadle Hall protest, said she was “speechless and overwhelmed” at the news but denounced the claim that the decision was done for “purely for financial reasons.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They have to say that,” Williams said bluntly, explaining that she believes if the UC said they had divested from fossil fuels for moral reasons rather than financial reasons, there would be “mounting pressure” to divest from other movements like the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/four-years-later-still-a-no-for-israel-divestment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Williams noted that Bachher and Sherman’s argument that fossil fuel investments are risky is something that the Fossil Free UC movement has been arguing since its inception. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Them making that decision was really the result of years of students and faculty and alums, finally chancellors getting on board, really advocating for this,” she said. “They wouldn’t necessarily have even given this a look had the campaign not have advocated for it so strongly.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several other UCSB climate activists — Ph.D. global studies student Theo LeQuesne, fourth-year political science major Cassie Macy and sociology professor John Foran — echoed Williams’ opinions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m just happy to come to some closure on this, it’s been a fantastic movement,” Foran said. “It should not have taken, of course, six years. We’re not delighted by the reasoning given by the Regents, that it’s [a] purely economic decision, we think that’s kind of not true.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It doesn’t acknowledge the fact that there was a movement demanding it, without which we wouldn’t be here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fossil Free UC was founded by students across the UC system in 2012. For the past several years, the group has held demonstrations at campuses including </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2016/05/06/uc-berkeley-students-and-alumni-stage-sit-in-at-uc-office-of-the-president/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and UCSB, all to encourage the Regents to divest from fossil fuels – but LeQuesne emphasized that it has been a long path to victory. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We started off kind of really taking the UC Regents as equals and [we were] really interested in trying to work with them,” LeQuesne said. “But about a year or two into that process, it because pretty clear that the UC Regents were not particularly interested in actually making this going forward.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He explained that around 2015, the group changed its strategy, moving toward “mobilizing the community approach.” They decided to get “more disruptive,” he said – “a more disruptive kind of movement, build approach necessary to really get the Regents to pay attention to us.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group organized across UC campuses, campaigning to get all student governments to endorse the divestment and organizing sit-ins. LeQuesne emphasized that one of the movement’s biggest successes was the 2017 Cheadle Hall sit-in, during which over 100 students sat in Cheadle Hall for over 72 hours until Chancellor Yang agreed to endorse students’ demands for fossil fuel divestment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Williams, who was present at the sit-in, said it was “powerful” to be there in that moment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a bit of nervousness because what you’re ultimately doing is civil disobedience,” she emphasized. “You’re doing something that is against the rules, but you’re doing it because you have so much respect for the institution and for the cause that you’re working on that you really feel like you need to take a step and do something, draw attention to it and make a change.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While climate activists at UCSB were happy to finally see the Regents take tangible action for climate justice, Foran said divesting from fossil fuels is only the first step for the UC in the “overarching global climate justice movement.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a small step in a long journey,” Foran said. “We’re up against the most powerful corporations in the history of the world and the governments they control. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But today is a good day in that struggle.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Macy, who was a first-year student during the 2017 sit-in and is now entering her last year at UCSB, her next steps are to ensure the UC “follow[s] their promises and fully divest,” but she’s also working on refilling the ranks now that many climate activists have graduated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The next steps are finding some people who can take the place of them and take the place of me in the future and just keep fighting for this environmental change,” Macy said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foran and Williams also pointed to the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-15/in-photos-11-minutes-for-11-years-youth-climate-strike-takes-over-arbor/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunrise Movement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as the next generation of climate activism at UCSB, and Williams referenced the </span><a href=\"https://globalclimatestrike.net/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">global climate strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> scheduled for Sept. 20-27. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[This is] for the fate of the planet.
