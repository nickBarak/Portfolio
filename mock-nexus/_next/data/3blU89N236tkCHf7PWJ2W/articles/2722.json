Party candidates — Steven Ho, Jorge Santos, Dylan Goldman and Vanessa Maldonado — and four Campus United candidates — Charles Neumann, Alexa Hernandez, Derek Yang, and Kia Sadeghi. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus United’s Juan Perez Tejada also participated as a candidate for university-owned housing senator.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salvador Hernandez-Arellano, a first-year political science major running for on-campus senator, and Andrea Reyes, a third-year communication major running for university-owned housing senator, did not attend the forum.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each candidate had one minute to make an opening statement about their platform. Andrew Doerr, the forum moderator, then asked each candidate two questions and each candidate had thirty seconds to make a concluding statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doerr first asked the candidates to identify the most important issue affecting on-campus residents. The second question, posed by the audience, addressed resident assistant (R.A.) welfare.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each prospective senator identified a set of issues that they wanted to address. Listed below are some of their goals.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho, a first-year biology and Asian-American studies double major, said he wants to help underrepresented students feel more comfortable on campus. He said he wants to focus his efforts as a senator on food insecurity, allocating student fees for R.A. programs and increasing transparency in the senate. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neumann, a first-year global studies major, said if elected, he hopes to increase the representation of the international student community. He said he plans to work on making college more affordable and hopes to create a liaison position to strengthen the relationship between A.S. and R.A.s.  </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez, a first-year economics and accounting major, said he is “passionate about making college more affordable for everyone.” If elected, she hopes to designate a C.A.P.S. counselor for R.A.s and personally reach out to them herself. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tejada Mir, a second-year economics and accounting major, said he wants to address tuition hikes with the state. When asked about R.A. welfare, he said “being there for them is a huge deal,” and wants residents to reach out to R.A.s to “lend them a hand … and acknowledge their presence.”</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang, a first-year political science and chemistry double major, said he wants to implement rollover and guest meal swipes for the dining commons, as well as increase the number of study spaces on campus. If elected, Yang said he wants to be a liaison for R.A.s and provide a specific C.A.P.S. counselor to address their needs.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santos, a first-year political science major, said he plans to improve the mental health resources on campus. When asked about R.A. welfare, Santos said he wants to create an A.S.-funded “mental-health social” for the R.A.s.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadeghi, a first-year political science major, stated he wants to limit the amount of stress for students and increase convenience on campus through providing more water stations in the resident halls and bike lanes at the Arbor. Sadeghi said he wants to partner with C.A.P.S. to provide a program for R.A.s as well as improve the relationship between R.A.s and residents.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goldman, a first-year physics major, said he wants to increase the amount of diversity in S.T.E.M. classes. He also said the rising cost of tuition is the most important issue affecting UCSB students. If elected, he said wants to create a catered mental health group and change the drug and alcohol policy to help R.A.s become healthier leaders.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado, a first-year undeclared student, said she wants to revise UCSB’s alcohol and drug program, which puts “unnecessary stress on student’s mental health.” When asked about R.A. welfare, she said she wants to increase R.A. approachability for students by changing the alcohol and drug policy for residents.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campaigning for A.S.

the closure, enforces environmental restoration regulations. The facility has submitted a plan to the CCC that aims to relocate the stables. <em>Min Xie / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Located near West Campus and the Devereux Slough, the property is home to an historic barn originally built in the 1920s as part of the Campbell Estate. It is now part of the UCSB Horse Boarders Association (HBA).</p>\n<p>According to the updated LRDP, the area that houses the facility will be restored to natural wetlands, although the HBA says the area has not functioned as a wetland in hundreds of years.</p>\n<p>Members are concerned the property is being used as “leverage” for the university to gain approval on future development projects from the California Coastal Commission (CCC).</p>\n<p>UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada, said, however, that the stable is located on environmentally sensitive area of campus.</p>\n<p>“Due to the sensitive nature of the area, the California Coastal Commission has required the campus to plan for the removal of the stable facilities,” she said. “They have given us 10 years to remove the facility.”</p>\n<p>Estrada said the university also submitted a Manure Management Plan to the CCC on March 25, 2015, to allow possible relocation of the horse stables. The report outlines the monthly removal of manure from community horse arenas, efforts to minimize runoff to the wetlands and that horse stalls be cleaned weekly and communal areas (such as turnouts) be cleaned four times a week.</p>\n<p>Jenny Dugan, UCSB associate research biologist and HBA faculty advisor, works very closely with the CCC and submitted the Manure Management Plan to the CCC on March 25, 2015.</p>\n<p>Holly Nuovo, senior environmental studies major and treasurer of HBA, considers the plan pivotal to UCSB’s sustainability plan. “I know they include our manure tonnage in their sustainability reports, so whenever they’re talking about waste management, part of that is about us,” she said.</p>\n<p>The all natural and organic manure is donated to the Indigenous Gardening Club and other gardening communities in the area, making the reuse of the manure beneficial to UCSB’s sustainability plan.</p>\n<p>The CCC is a state organization that regulates the university’s developments. They aim to protect environmentally sensitive habitats, requiring the university to restore one area in tandem with any new development in the coastal area, like the Sierra Madre housing. The CCC could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>The HBA has been active since the 1970s and has been fighting forced closures by the university since the 1990s. They have halted definitive closures by pressuring the chancellor’s office with an influx of letters intended to emphasize their value to the community.</p>\n<p>“They think that what we offer doesn’t have enough value, and so they can promise the Coastal Commission that they’ll remove our activity and restore the natural habitat in order to get approval for their other development projects,” said Nuovo.</p>\n<p>LRDP regulations prevent the HBA from changing the aerial view of the barn by creating any new permanent structures, repairs or effectively altering the “footprint” of the barn.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75779\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75779\" data-attachment-id=\"75779\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/horse-1-by-min-xie/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Horse 1 by Min Xie\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-75779\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-75779\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The stables, located near West Campus and Devereaux Slough, sit atop environmentally sensitive areas.<br>Because of this, the campus has been tasked with closing the facilities down within the next 10 years. <em>Min Xie / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The LRDP restrictions maintain that repairs cannot result in the demolition or reconstruction of 50 percent or more of any structure. The facility also abides by the CCC’s environmental sustainability regulations.</p>\n<p>Lauren Rudnick, a second-year mechanical engineering major and member of the HBA, is currently making repairs to her horse’s stable and is mainly concerned with the longevity and safety of the stall.</p>\n<p>“These restrictions make it difficult to fully repair anything,” Rudnick said, adding that from a legal standpoint, the restrictions could be at fault if the animals or caretakers are harmed.</p>\n<p>Sitting about 300 to 400 yards away from the edge of the horse facility is a wetland buffer zone that the Coastal Commission closely maintains.</p>\n<p>The HBA has planted blackberries, Bermuda grass and other native bushes around the stalls and the buffer zone. The plants absorb nitrogen and other plant-growing material to filter the runoff from the horse’s manure so no harm comes to the wetlands.</p>\n<p>“It is possible to co-exist with the slough. We are doing it now,” Nuovo said.</p>\n<p>Existing restrictions to build in the area because of native burial sites and environmental concerns make the area convenient to use as “leverage,” Nuovo said. Pressure from UC Regents to make campuses larger put the university in a position to follow through with the closure.</p>\n<p>It would take roughly 20 years or more for the area to be restored as a wetland. The slough does not naturally reach the facility, so major excavations would occur for water to reach the area.</p>\n<p>“They use this land as a tool to return to the environment, but I honestly feel that what we do here helps the students integrate into the environment and the community at whole so much better than just returning it straight to wetland,” Nouvo said, adding that the facility offers affordable horse boarding opportunities to students that could not otherwise afford it.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, February 16, 2017 print edition of

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressman Salud Carbajal spoke at UCSB on Monday about the difficulty of passing Democratic legislation in a Republican-majority Congress. <em>Anthony Lai/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Carbajal expressed hesitant hope for progressive legislation under the Trump administration but attempted to ensure the town hall attendees that he would do what he could despite being a Democrat in a Republican-majority congress.</p>\n<p>The congressman has sponsored or co-sponsored over 60 bills since being elected to Congress in November and said 25 of the bills have been bipartisan.</p>\n<p>“I still believe there’s always room for collaboration,” he said, despite the currently divided political climate.</p>\n<p>The town hall, hosted by the Associated Students Environmental Affairs Board, was divided into three sections of discussion: the environment, education and immigration. Many of the attendees’ concerns focused on how the Trump administration’s new and proposed policies would impact these issues.</p>\n<p>Carbajal addressed a student’s question regarding how he would combat the president’s budget cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency’s office of research and development. He said he would continue to “speak out” against harmful legislation.</p>\n<p>“The reality is that I am in the minority party right now, and one party controls both chambers of Congress and the White House,” Carbajal said. “So what we can do is put forth legislation, which oftentimes cannot move forward, and develop bipartisan support to bring it forward for a hearing to bring it to the floor.”</p>\n<p>Many students asked questions about issues affecting students, including food insecurity, tuition and loans.</p>\n<p>Carbajal said since Trump’s proposed budget cuts funding to programs that help combat students’ food insecurity, he has sponsored an appropriations bill request for more funding for food banks.</p>\n<p>Carbajal went on to address college tuition hikes and the advent of paying off student loans after graduation. The congressman, a UCSB alumnus, said he still has not paid off all his student loans.</p>\n<p>Carbajal said he has supported an appropriations bill to increase the Pell Grant and make access to the grant year round. He also said he wants to work on lowering the interest rates attached to student loans.</p>\n<p>“The interest rates … are really high, and I think we need to stop the profiteering by certain financial institutions on the backs of students trying to get a college education,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>Carbajal addressed the issue of immigration last, sharing that his father immigrated to the United States from Mexico back “when immigration worked.”</p>\n<p>He said the immigration system no longer works and needs comprehensive reform and the creation of a clear path to citizenship.</p>\n<p>Carbajal said it is challenging to introduce Democratic legislation in the current Congress because oftentimes Republicans block the legislation from moving forward to the floor.</p>\n<p>He said, however, that constituents still can influence policies when they vocalize their concerns, noting the way the Republicans failed to pass their alternative to the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>“I remind you that when you believe in these issues and sometimes feel a little powerless and you question whether your advocacy … works, look what happened with the Affordable Care Act,” he said. “That happened because people spoke up.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

The first question pertained to the use of hate speech on campus, while the second one asked the candidates how they plan to work with the administration to achieve their goals as senators.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates were given 30 seconds for opening and closing remarks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates explained to audience members their plans for improving the lives of UCSB students. Here are some of the highlights:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Al-Anbar, a third-year anthropology major, said she wants to “pioneer” a transfer commission and help marginalized students feel more represented on campus. She said she believes that while there is a constitutional right to free speech, the university should “not entertain” hate speech and help maintain an environment free from violence.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maalizadeh, a third-year biology major, said he wants to improve CLAS access for transfer students and expand transfer orientation, two issues he wants to work on with the university administrators. He said it is an “amazing time” to be a transfer student, and he wants to focus his efforts on increasing support for them. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carey, a second-year global studies and geography double major, said he wants to use his “passion for academics” and “ability to strive as a leader” to serve his community. According to Carey, hate speech should not be tolerated on campus, and he hopes he can “use existing channels” of communication with campus administrators to achieve his goals as a senator.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez, a third-year political science major, said she wants students to know how A.S. can affect change on campus. She also said she wants to “streamline” the dialogue between A.S. and university administrators and work to decrease tuition and increase class enrollment availability. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel, a second-year political science major, said she wants to ensure that student fees are seen through student resources. Kopel said she believes hate speech can make some students “feel alienated” on campus and wants to help facilitate productive dialogue between differing groups. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banicki, a first-year biology major, said he wants to create more outdoor study spaces and hammocks on campus. He also said he wants to emphasize mental health and extend resources to students who may feel overwhelmed. As the president of the Santa Catalina South Residence Hall, he said he already “has a foot in the door” to work with university administrators. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez, a second-year sociology and economics double major, said she wants to increase representation of minority groups on campus. If elected, she said, she hopes to make college life more affordable and accessible to students.      </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uemura, a first-year chemistry major, said she wants to implement a mental health counselor for CCS and ensure an open dialogue with campus administrators. She said she believes there is a “fine line” between hate speech and free speech and said she hopes to maintain CCS as a “very safe space” that is welcome to everyone.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almas, a second-year chemical engineering major, said he wants to work on making college more affordable for students, citing the high costs of tutoring and textbooks. He said he wants to create an open dialogue with administrators to ensure that the College of Engineering can be a safe and affordable environment.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diamond, a second-year electrical engineering major, said he is excited about the future of A.S. and wants to increase students’ awareness about the university’s “incredible” resources including UCIV and the Community Housing Office. He said he believes engineers are underrepresented and wants to increase mental health resources for them. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campaigning for A.S.
