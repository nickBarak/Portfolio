Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>In the biggest rivalry in college soccer, the Big West-leading Gaucho men’s soccer team hosted northern neighbor Cal Poly with the chance to clinch the Big West North by sending the visitors home with their second Blue-Green loss in as many weeks. The home fans were rocking, but Santa Barbara couldn’t find a winning goal as the game played out to a 0-0 stalemate following overtime.</p>\n<p>UCSB remains atop the North division with the result at 5-0-3 in Big West play, 9-5-3 overall, five points clear of second-place Sac State, and although the home side failed to clinch the North with a win over the Mustangs, a tie in either of SB’s last two regular season games would essentially clinch the title. As for the Mustangs, the tie leaves the squad at the bottom of the division at 1-5-2 in conference play while standing them at 3-9-3 overall.</p>\n<p>The 11,424 in attendance at Harder made up the largest crowd in the country this season for a men’s soccer game, and the rivalry is now responsible for drawing 15 of the 20 largest regular season crowds in NCAA soccer. Early on, the atmosphere was deafening, students packing the main grandstand to the brim, but as the game played out, both teams settled into what would become a dirty, defensive battle.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The visitors seemed to have opened the scoring in the 15th minute when Cal Poly senior defender Kody Wakasa directed the ball past freshman keeper Titouan Le Roux with his right hand and was shown the match’s first yellow for the blatant hand ball.</p>\n<p>After that, the Gauchos were able to create several chances through crosses from the wingers and fullbacks, coming closest in the 22nd minute as senior striker Nick DePuy smashed his towering header off the crossbar and back into play, but no teammates were around before the Mustang defense was able to clear their line.</p>\n<p>The All-American striker was hugely involved in his team’s best chances, including a team-high five shots. Despite his recent scoring troubles, DePuy has been doing everything to get on the scoresheet and is tied for second on the team with six goals this year. His recent dry spell — one goal in last seven matches — even left his teammates and coaches wishing a bit of luck on the frontman.</p>\n<p>“The streak is at eight now. Nick’s hit the post on a header in eight straight games and he did it again tonight,” said Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg half-jokingly. “He’s still getting up and battling for that ball, but it’s just one of those unlucky streaks where he keeps finding the post, and tonight that’s the goal that opens up the whole game. Unfortunate, but Nick played very, very well tonight.”</p>\n<p>UCSB dominated the match, holding Cal Poly to just one shot in each half, but the Gaucho attack failed to find a goal as it pressed on in the second half and overtime. The Mustangs stacked all but one man behind the ball for the last forty minutes, including OT. Santa Barbara outshot the visitors 10-2, but were ultimately held scoreless for the first time in eleven games.</p>\n<p>The meeting was highly contested with 35 total fouls, and each team had at least two valid penalty claims that were waived on by the referee. In the postgame press conference, Vom Steeg said the allowance of overly physical play made it too difficult for either team to score, and ultimately Poly stayed resolute in the back, earning a tie at Harder for the second straight year.</p>\n<p>“It’s really hard to generate an attack when they can physically hold you back,” said Vom Steeg. “Nick played great tonight considering its two arms around his waist wrapped up so you can’t get free. You can’t get open in that box because at some point you realize there won’t be a call.”</p>\n<p>Having just beaten Cal Poly on the road last weekend, SB planned on wearing out the Mustangs and taking the game late, and while the coaching staff must have been pleased with how their game plan played out, the offense couldn’t find the moment it needed to break the deadlock. A win would’ve clinched the Big West North for the reigning division champs, but the Gauchos were unable to find the winner and are now forced to grab a positive result this week in order to lock up at least one home game for conference playoffs.</p>\n<p>“It would’ve been nice to get the title in front of the crowd, but the team played really well,” said junior midfielder Kevin Feucht, who leads UCSB with 10 goals. “If you play five more minutes we find the goal. At the end they were split up and sliding all over the field, so if we had one final shot, one final pass, we could’ve got the win.”</p>\n<p>The biggest crowd of the year brought an electric energy to the rivalry match, but the game never opened up enough to do the nationally-televised meeting justice, as both teams locked up the opposing attackers and played out the Blue-Green rivalry’s first scoreless draw since 2009.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">SCENES IN THE 15th MINUTE 0-0 STILL IN THE BLUE/GREEN RIVALRY <a href=\"https://t.co/EU178e6k3G\">pic.twitter.com/EU178e6k3G</a></p>\n<p>— Daily Nexus Sports (@thenexus_sports) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thenexus_sports/status/790030498114392064\">October 23, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>UCSB’s next match is at Sac St. on Wednesday, October 26 at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73397\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-23/gauchos-and-mustangs-duel-ends-in-draw/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73397\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-23/gauchos-and-mustangs-duel-ends-in-draw/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-23/gauchos-and-mustangs-duel-ends-in-draw/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-23/gauchos-and-mustangs-duel-ends-in-draw/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-23/gauchos-and-mustangs-duel-ends-in-draw/","id":1401,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1400,1399,1398],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns","biography":"Not available","articles":[1401,1404,1408,1409,1412,1413,1414,1416,1417,1418,1420,1422,1424,1427,1429,1432,1433,1435,1438,1439,1440,1446,1453,1454,1456,1458,1491,1492,1493,1904,1916,1929,1972,3308,3321,3335,4837,5028,5029,5031,5033,5034,5035,5036,5037,5038,5039,5040,5043,5045,5050,5052,5053,5054,5056,5057,5058,5059,5060,5061,5062,5350,5366,5694,5703,5705,5706],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Men’s Soccer Continues Strong Offensive Showing Against Winless Highlanders","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer_UCSBCalPoly_KennethSong-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer_UCSBCalPoly_KennethSong-10-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB improves to 2-0 in conference play after defeating winless UC Riverside 3-1 at home.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Gauchos kicked off their Big West matchup against UC Riverside late Saturday night with the offensive-minded approach they showcased in their first conference game of the year against Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>With that mindset, Santa Barbara was able to outlast the Highlanders 3-1 to improve to 4-4-2 overall, and now 2-0 in conference play sitting atop the standings with six points.

The capitalized opportunity for UCR gave the team an early lead, 1-0.</p>\n<p>UCSB wasted no time in trying to get an equalizer, multiple plays by freshman No. 9 Rodney Michael and sophomore No. 13 Ignacio Tellechea lead to the Gauchos being able to take good shots on goal, forcing the UC Riverside keeper Vincent Morales to make plays in front of the net.</p>\n<p>The unsuccessful scoring opportunities lead to UCSB Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg making changes in the 33rd minute, substituting No. 13 Ignacio Tellechea and No. 10 Noah Billingsley for No. 17 Derek Kryzda and No. 21 Alex Liua.</p>\n<p>The newly brought in duo of Kryzda and Liua were quickly able to maneuver the offense and create some close chances for the Gauchos. It was in the 37th minute where Liua found himself in the right place to receive a bounce off a UCR defender that went left of the box. Liua was able to perfectly send the ball over the keeper’s head and into the corner of the net to leave the game all tied up at halftime.</p>\n<p>It was in the 37th minute where Liua found himself in the right place to receive a bounce off a UCR defender that went left of the box. Liua was able to perfectly send the ball over the keeper’s head and into the corner of the net to leave the game all tied up at halftime.</p>\n<p>The beginning of the second half did not bring an end to UCSB being able to find ways through the Highlander’s defense and it was Gaucho sophomore Noah Billingsley who put UCSB out in front. The forward took a shot from the left side of the box and floated the ball over the keeper’s head and into the right corner of the net.</p>\n<p>UCR stayed in the game and would occasionally get through the UCSB defense, but the Highlanders were unable to find a way into the net throughout the second half and any shot on goal was either saved or cleared away. The Highlanders were more often finding themselves in their own end trying to prevent the game from getting too ahead of them.</p>\n<p>The defense for the Highlanders finally lapsed in the final five minutes of the game, allowing Gaucho forward Rodney Michael to run past two defenders into the right side of the box and sending a shot past the goalkeeper that was buried into the left corner of the net, allowing the game to end in a 3-1 UCSB victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB players Rodney Michael, Ignacio Tellechea, and Alex Liua continue to work well in the offense through making the correct passes and being able to finish the opportunities presented in front of the net, a great sign for a team looking to establish itself early on in the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is Thursday, October 5 at the Cal State Northridge where the Matadors will be playing the Gauchos at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Steeg didn’t want to use the word “revenge” coming into the UCSB men’s soccer team’s first game of the season against No. 8 Stanford, but that’s what the Gauchos got. An aggressive first half header by junior forward Nick DePuy was all Santa Barbara needed to come away with a 1-0 win and start its season off on a great note.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“We take a lot of pride in the way we played tonight,” Vom Steeg said. “I thought we battled all the way through, we got great bench contribution. I thought that we found out a lot about ourselves tonight.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">UCSB last faced Stanford on the road in September of last season in a game in which the Gauchos conceded three goals in the first 12 minutes on their way to a 4-1 loss. With a more experienced squad this time around, UCSB was able to keep finding ways to preserve a shutout and defeat the Cardinal for the first time since 2004.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“We’ve been playing that video for our guys for about eight months and looking forward to this game,” Vom Steeg said. “The gameplan was a little more defensive all the way because I knew that we could break out on them, which we did, but the defense won tonight.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">The first 10 minutes of the game was all Stanford as the Cardinal came out aggressive and was able to put some pressure on the UCSB backline. Stanford’s best chance of the half came 20 minutes in, when sophomore midfielder Drew Skundrich was found with a chipped through ball in the box, forcing UCSB goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg off his line. Skundrich was able to get off a decent header, but the composed freshman made an outstanding leg save to keep the game scoreless.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“Justin did well. He got his first shutout and his first yellow card, so he’s got one more than I do in the season,” Vom Steeg said. “He was very clean with all the balls that came in. When you play with a goalie that the defense is confident having behind, if they have a player break through, you know Justin is going to make a play for you.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">After being subbed in with less than 16 minutes to go in the half, UCSB midfielder Seo-In Kim made an instant impact. Playing in his first regular season game with UCSB, the junior transfer from Duke used his speed to find space down the right side before sending in a slightly deflected cross towards the far post. Just as he did all last season, DePuy attacked the ball in the air and was able to power a header past Stanford junior goalkeeper Andrew Epstein to put the Gauchos up 1-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“When I came in, I knew I could make a difference,” Kim said. “Tim really talked about breaking the defense, breaking the defensive midfield line, that’s what I want to do. Just having Nick up there, you can’t really miss him, so it made my job easy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">With the goal, DePuy has now scored in six of his last seven games dating back to last season with eight goals during that stretch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Less than four minutes into the second half, Stanford thought it tied the game with a goal off a free kick into the box, but UCSB was saved by an offside call.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Much of the second half saw the Cardinal pushing men forward in search of a goal, resulting in a couple of good chances with just under 30 minutes to go. Fortunately for UCSB, a pair of Stanford shots from the edge of the 18-yard box were poorly hit, one being easily saved by Vom Steeg and the other sailing high.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">A couple of fan favorites in sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani and freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong nearly connected to put the game away midway through the final stanza. For the second time in the half, Selemani beat not one, but two defenders down the left side before finding Acheampong making a run into the box. The lefty tried to set himself up on his favored foot, making it a difficult angle for the shot, and he sent it just wide of the post.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Injuries then became an issue for UCSB as Kim, junior left back Ismaila Jome and junior midfielder Drew Murphy all required clock stoppages in order to be subbed out towards the end of the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">The Gauchos found themselves playing mainly on their defensive half for the final 10 minutes of the match. Stanford’s last good chance came with 1:09 remaining, when a cross from the left wing found Foster Langsdorf wide open in the box, but his header went wide and an exhausted UCSB defense was soon able to celebrate the impressive 1-0 win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Midfielder Kevin Feucht was perhaps the game’s best player. The sophomore transfer did all the little things, putting his body on the line to make big plays defensively before helping transition to offense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“I thought Kevin was unbelievable tonight. The back line were really relying on him to kind of pick up things in front of them,” Vom Steeg said. “He threw his body around in the middle of that park, broke up so many plays and stretched out for tackles. That’s a player that’s going to help you win a lot of games with that kind of work rate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">After missing last week’s game against Westmont due to a groin injury, defender Sam Strong was a big addition for the Gauchos at center back. The freshman looked comfortable all game, making few mistakes and winning a number of headers deep in the box.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“We just had to compete and not let them get behind us and that’s what we did,” Strong said. “My groin felt better two days ago and it was a good sign, so I knew I was going to play. I didn’t know I was going to go 90, but it felt good.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Four Gauchos picked up yellow cards on the day, including DePuy, Strong and Vom Steeg.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“I really feel like this is a team that’s just going to get better and better,” Vom Steeg said. “What’s exciting about this group is come see us play in six weeks and I think it’ll be much better than we saw tonight, which was good enough to beat Stanford.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">UCSB will look to continue a great start to the season with games against Denver and New Mexico next Friday and Sunday.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64598\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-29/mens-soccer-enjoys-perfect-start-to-season-with-1-0-win-over-no-8-stanford/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64598\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-29/mens-soccer-enjoys-perfect-start-to-season-with-1-0-win-over-no-8-stanford/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-29/mens-soccer-enjoys-perfect-start-to-season-with-1-0-win-over-no-8-stanford/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-29/mens-soccer-enjoys-perfect-start-to-season-with-1-0-win-over-no-8-stanford/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-29/mens-soccer-enjoys-perfect-start-to-season-with-1-0-win-over-no-8-stanford/","id":1400,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1399,1398,1397],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Rides 4-Game Win Streak Into Cal State Northridge Thurs.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsUCR-170930-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsUCR-170930-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB hopes to sustain its momentum against a Cal State Northridge team that is in need of a victory.

Santa Barbara will look to avoid being defeated by a Northridge team that has struggled as of late, going 0-3-1 in its last four matches, which included a three-match losing slump, and owning a 5-5-1 record.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were tagged as the preseason favorite to win the Big West North Division for a fifth-consecutive time entering this season and seem to be en route to doing so as a result of their improved goal scoring. During its undefeated stretch, UCSB has outscored its opponents 10-3.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Meanwhile, the Matadors will be trying to find their offense sooner rather than later considering they only scored one goal in the conference opening weekend.</p>\n<p>Altogether, both ends of the pitch will be meticulously planning for Thursday’s game as UCSB won’t wish to relinquish their top spot in the North Division standings and Northridge will seek its first conference win.</p>\n<p>The recent season can attest to the fact that UCSB becomes a different team for the better when conference play begins. After losing its conference opener in the 2016-17 season, UCSB went on to win six of its eight next matches (6-0-2) before its next loss. In 2015-16, the Gauchos won their first four Big West matchups.</p>\n<p>Over its two conference matchups, UCSB has already netted a total of eight goals on the season.</p>\n<p>Compared to the eight goals they scored throughout their entire 10-match non-conference schedule, the progress of this young roster is very much visible.</p>\n<p>With a current total of seven different goal scorers, the team is now led by two different players in this statistic category. Sophomore forward Ignacio Tellechea originally came onto the scene as the team’s leading goal scorer during the non-conference portion of the year. He also notched in another goal during the conference home opener against Fullerton via a beautifully curled shot from around the corner spot.</p>\n<p>Next up is freshman forward Rodney Michael, who has now scored a goal in each Big West match thus far. It was announced Monday that Michael was selected as the Big West Offensive Player of the Week. Both Tellechea and</p>\n<p>Michael currently sit at the top of the team’s scoring stats with four goals apiece, and will look to improve upon that tally come game night against CSUN.</p>\n<p>As for the Matadors, the beginning stages of the Big West season have not been very kind as they had to start off with two games on the road to finish five straight road matches. Still, Northridge is 2-1 on the year at home and will expect to turn things around once UCSB comes to town.</p>\n<p>A likely candidate to resolve CSUN’s goal scoring drought would be senior forward Emmanuel Usen Jr., who has totaled five goals for his side on the year. Also adding two assists to his name, Usen will surely be the beneficiary of most Matador targets and key to Head Coach Terry Davila’s game plan.</p>\n<p>Speaking of head coaches, much respect can be awarded to UCSB’s Tim Vom Steeg for getting his team ready in time for the conference regular season. The Gauchos are currently the only Big West team without a conference loss. Consistency will be key from here on out, and all signs point upwards for the Gauchos’ yearlong campaign and postseason aspirations.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be on the road this Thursday night, Oct. 5, to face Cal State Northridge at 7 p.m. at the Matador Soccer Field.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Oct. 5, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78996\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-rides-4-game-win-streak-into-cal-state-northridge-thurs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78996\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-rides-4-game-win-streak-into-cal-state-northridge-thurs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-rides-4-game-win-streak-into-cal-state-northridge-thurs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-rides-4-game-win-streak-into-cal-state-northridge-thurs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-rides-4-game-win-streak-into-cal-state-northridge-thurs/","id":1398,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1397,1396,1395],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
