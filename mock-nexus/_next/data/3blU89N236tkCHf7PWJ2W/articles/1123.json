However, Huskie pitcher Madi Schreyer held Clark at third by popping up star freshman infielder Sierra Altmeyer to end the threat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s tough schedule would only continue on Saturday as it faced two of the toughest teams in the tournament: 25</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ranked Texas A&amp;M and 4</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ranked Louisiana State University.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Texas A&amp;M showed no mercy as they scored 8 runs in the first inning against the Gauchos, walking away with a 13-5 victory in just five innings.  UCSB did score runs in three of the five innings, plating two big runs in the second on senior catcher Samantha Stark’s clutch double to left center scoring both Altmeyer and junior infielder Emily Brucelas.  Stark came home with the third run of the inning when junior outfielder Stacy Cavazos singled into right center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later in the day against LSU, the Gauchos fared better, holding the Tigers to just one run through the first four innings.  However in the fifth, LSU knocked in four runs on three hits and an error, and the Tigers ended up taking the win 5-2. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaucho senior starter Ashley Ludlow pitched a complete game and worked hard for all six innings against LSU, allowing five runs (three earned) on seven hits, and striking out four.  On offense, the Gauchos out hit the Tigers 11-7, which were the most hits given up by LSU all season.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos did have a chance to score early on LSU, as leadoff hitter Kristen Clark singled, followed by another solid single by Palomares, putting runners on first and second with nobody out.  Sophomore outfielder Jessica Johnston then bunted Clark and Palomares into scoring position with one out.  After that, LSU pitcher Sydney Smith shutdown the Gauchos, striking out Altmeyer and popping up Brucelas to end the inning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clark had another great game at the plate for Santa Barbara, going 3-for-3, and is now batting .485 on the season.  Palomares also had three hits to go with her team-high two RBIs.  Unfortunately, the heart of the Gauchos order left 6 runners stranded in the game, going a collective 0 for 7 at the plate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB finished the weekend with a much better outcome, shutting down Bethune-Cookman with a 4-1 victory.  The Wildcats scored their lone run of the game in the second, however that was all the Gauchos would allow.  The Gauchos took over the game starting in the third when Palamores scored off of an Altmeyer RBI single to left field.  UCSB went on to score two more runs in the fourth, and their last run of the game in the sixth.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brucelas had a strong game with a double and two runs scored.  Ludlow came on in relief and pitched a solid game, striking out 10 and giving up 6 hits over the final 5 and 1/3 as she collected the win. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will host their first tournament of the season this weekend, the Gaucho Classic I.  The first pitch will be thrown out at 8:30 on Friday morning, against South Carolina.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

UCSB would head into halftime with a one point lead, as they looked to make their second half adjustments to extend their lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara ended up dominating the third quarter as they outscored the highlanders by nine points. Miller was on fire as she knocked down three three-pointers, giving her 16 points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although she has been inconsistent at times, Miller has been huge for the ‘Chos in their wins. As the group’s best scorer, she has shown the ability to not only knock down three-point shots but also attack the basket. With the season coming close to the end, many fans will look forward to seeing her take her game to another level next season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB would carry this momentum into the fourth quarter and win the game fairly comfortably by 17 points. Sophomore guard Danae Miller was able to find her rhythm late in the ball game as she scored nine points. Jones checked into the game with two minutes remaining but was unable to score on her layup attempt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This may have been the Gauchos best defensive quarter all season as they held the highlanders to just five points and 14 percent from the field. UCR was unable to find any rhythm on offense due to the consistent ball pressure and good defense by Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this being a rebuilding season for UCSB, there is much to be excited about for next season. Everyone from the team except Paris Jones will be returning, allowing the team to grow together with little turnover. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos have shown flashes throughout the year but have not been able to string together victories. With the squad continuing to develop their chemistry, they will surely make an impact in the Big West Conference for the next couple seasons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It would have been easy for Santa Barbara to stop giving their best effort during their tough stretches but head coach Bonnie Henrickson was able to keep the team on course. By continuing to play hard, the team has started to be rewarded by getting more wins.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their past five matchups, UCSB has been able to win three of them, showing that they have taken major strides from earlier in the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They will put their two game winning streak on the line this upcoming Saturday in their last game of the regular season at 2:30 p.m against UC Davis. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86619\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-04/gauchos-take-down-highlanders-for-second-consecutive-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86619\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-04/gauchos-take-down-highlanders-for-second-consecutive-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-04/gauchos-take-down-highlanders-for-second-consecutive-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-04/gauchos-take-down-highlanders-for-second-consecutive-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-04/gauchos-take-down-highlanders-for-second-consecutive-win/","id":1121,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[1120,1119,1118],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Remains on the Road, Will Participate in Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Softball_vsCSUN-20150412-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Softball_vsCSUN-20150412-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB softball team will look to possibly pull off some upsets as three of the five opponents it will face at the Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic are nationally ranked within the Top 25.

Starting at 9:30 a.m., the Gauchos will take on No. 25 Texas A&amp;M and No. 4 LSU.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently 4-1, Texas A&amp;M finished with a solid overall record of 40-20 last season. Returning to its batting lineup are several players who hit over .300 last year. Sophomore infielder Tori Vidales holds the team’s second highest batting average at a .417 clip and is fresh off a team-high 51 runs scored in 2015.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Texas A&amp;M possesses a respectable offense, its pitching rotation has weakened with the loss of senior pitcher Rachel Fox, who totaled a team-high 182 strikeouts and a 23-14 record in her final season. The Gauchos will look to capitalize against the Aggies’ youth in pitching, which only has one senior in the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LSU comes into the tournament with a record of 4-1. After suffering its only loss against Pacific, LSU exploded for a 10-1 victory over Pacific in a rematch the next day. Guiding the Tigers’ redemptive win were two of their best hitters in junior outfielder Bailey Landry and senior infielder Bianka Bell.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bell helped to bring in four runs while Landry recorded two hits and an RBI in the win.

With young players having such an immediate impact, Bethune-Cookman is a team the Gauchos cannot overlook. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara has a challenging series of games in this weekend’s Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic. However, Head Coach Brie Galicinao knows exactly what her team needs to do to successfully approach them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to take care of the little things on defense and pitching and continue to score big on offense. If the team continues to hit and score every game while our defense and pitching irons out some things, we’ll be in every single game,” Galicinao said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the Gauchos taking on such strong lineups this weekend, the pitching staff will be feeling the heat, but the Gauchos’ defense will come ready to play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With disciplined power hitters, we just have to be smart about our pitching call strategy and knowing how to best challenge hitters,” Galicinao explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After facing just one ranked opponent last weekend in No. 9 Arizona, UCSB will face its most difficult set of games as it will face three nationally ranked teams this weekend: No. 4 LSU, No. 11 Washington and No. 25 Texas A&amp;M. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game action will start against the Binghamton Bearcats this Friday, Feb. 19 at 12:30 p.m. The Gauchos will face Washington later that day at 3 p.m. Its Saturday doubleheader on Feb. 20 will begin at 9:30 a.m. against Texas A&amp;M and LSU at 3 p.m. Ending UCSB’s weekend will be its game against Bethune-Cookman at 2 p.m. on Sunday, Feb. 21. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68345\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-on-the-road-for-another-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68345\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-on-the-road-for-another-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-on-the-road-for-another-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-on-the-road-for-another-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-on-the-road-for-another-tournament/","id":1120,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1119,1118,1117],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
