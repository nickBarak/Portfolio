Legal Code.</p>\n<p>The bill proposed that all gender binary pronouns (he/him/his, she/her/hers) and accompanying grammar be altered for gender-neutral pronouns (they/them/theirs).</p>\n<p>Senator Elias Jordan got the idea for the bill during a training session when Christine Dolan, associate director of the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), spoke about the importance of society becoming more gender inclusive.</p>\n<p>“We know that LGBTQ people are everywhere, at every intersection of identities, and we know that all oppression is connected,” Dolan says in her Student Affairs biography. “Our liberation is collective, and until we can join in solidarity to challenge racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic and other systems of oppression, we cannot be free.”</p>\n<p>The bill gained student interest after the Senate’s retreat, prompting Jordan to get it passed quickly. He worked at his high school’s resource and counseling center to become more informed on topics of gender diversity and sexuality.</p>\n<p>“I thought this could be a big step forward on a larger scale, considering how prestigious UCSB is,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>The legislation, which was the first piece proposed by the Senate member, was slowed down because of minor writing issues. It experienced no opposition in Senate.</p>\n<p>Changing an official document to accommodate every person, Jordan said, validates people on campus who don’t feel as if they have a voice.</p>\n<p>UCSB took another step toward inclusivity this summer when the Office of Registrar worked with the RCSGD to update the school’s system so that ACCESS cards, class rosters and faculty interactions with students would change according to the student’s preferred name.</p>\n<p>Pronouns haven’t been altered in the system, but students who identify with a different first name can use it without having to change any legal documents.</p>\n<p>Jordan said he hopes the legislation can prompt both individuals, as well as other institutions, to think about the acceptance of others and the role we as individuals play in that.</p>\n<p>“Depending on how far it could spread, I think we can help people think about the diversity that we have as something to celebrate and not sweep under the rug,” he said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, November 3, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73653\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-s-legal-code-revised-to-include-non-binary-pronouns/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73653\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-s-legal-code-revised-to-include-non-binary-pronouns/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-s-legal-code-revised-to-include-non-binary-pronouns/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-s-legal-code-revised-to-include-non-binary-pronouns/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-s-legal-code-revised-to-include-non-binary-pronouns/","id":2712,"author":{"id":101,"name":"Allison Garfield"},"related":[2711,2710,2709],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":101,"name":"Allison Garfield","biography":"Not available","articles":[2384,2413,2447,2457,2712,3913,4418,5825,6732],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Library Opening Postponed","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Library_Photos-Courtesy-of-Karen-Lindell-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Library_Photos-Courtesy-of-Karen-Lindell-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Library Senior Writer Karen Lindell said the expanded library will open on Jan. 4, 2016, rather than this November as was announced this summer.

Additionally, Padilla will be able to create tools that make it easier for researchers to organize information that is already available to them, such as email correspondence and documents in inaccessible formats.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">New Mac computers also made their debut in the Learning Commons earlier this summer, which are now the only Mac computers available on campus for general student use.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The installation of the six iMacs and three MacPros comes as part of the technology plan that came with the expansion of Davidson Library.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“We feel that the Mac operating system is the best fit to accommodate for increasingly interdisciplinary coursework,” Rebecca Metzger, the library outreach coordinator, said. “It’s not unusual for a biology student to need a film editing program for a final class project, for instance.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Metzger, funding for the computers came from the library’s budget, mostly made up of state money and private donations. The library also plans to use $30,000 to $40,000 from the Class of 2016 senior class gift to install additional technology.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">One of the biggest plans for the upcoming school year is to address the compact space issue inside the library. Over 250,000 people visit the library every month, and this is expected to increase with one of the largest incoming freshman classes in history starting UCSB in fall 2016.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">This year, library staff will focus on adding furniture and expanding late-night study to other parts of the building. The second floor Mountainside will become available Fall Quarter for late-night hours.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Metzger said she is currently working with UCSB’s Health &amp; Wellness Center to obtain two egg chairs for the library that will help promote relaxation during the demanding academic year.</p>\n<p>According to Metzger, improving the learning commons is an evolving process, and the library staff is always looking for student suggestions regarding technology needs and furniture needs. Suggestions can be submitted at the wooden boxes on the services desks or by emailing <i>outreach@library.ucsb.edu</i>.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, September

id=\"caption-attachment-64975\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Tarush Mohanti/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>In his Peanuts-inspired booth, Larry Calvaletto is back outside Davidson Library for the 2015-2016 school year to facilitate conversations with anyone interested.</p>\n<p>Calvaletto began regularly talking with students, faculty and campus visitors last fall, standing at the booth from either 9 a.m. or noon until 3 p.m. He aims to connect with the younger generation through conversation and is willing to chat with anyone about any topic or question.</p>\n<p>Calvaletto said although the advice and conversations are free, he accepts donations to support mission trips.</p>\n<p>“It’s not about the money so I always have a sign that it’s free,” Calvaletto said. “My children were missionaries in Africa, they’ve now returned to the States, but I plan to use it to help some other types of missions somewhere else.”</p>\n<p>Calvaletto said his main goal is to “make a difference” and encourage the younger generation to make smart decisions.</p>\n<p>“I see culture changing faster than I ever imagined,” Calvaletto said. “So my goal is to one by one encourage students to do what they feel is right.”</p>\n<p>According to Calvaletto, the most important advice he has to offer was given to him by an upperclassman when he attended California Maritime Academy.</p>\n<p>“After a week I wanted to quit,” Calvaletto said. “And an upperclassmen came alongside me and said, ‘You can quit if you want, but you’re not getting back any of your money.’ What I suggest is just stay for this semester and if at the end of this semester if you decide to quit you can quit then.”</p>\n<p>Office of Student Life Dean of Student Life &amp; Activities Katya Armistead said she approved his booth to be on campus and has received nothing but positive comments about Calvaletto.<br>\n“He’s a colorful fellow; I see students really enjoy talking with him,” Armistead said.</p>\n<p>According to Calvaletto, his questions and conversations usually revolve around relationships.</p>\n<p>“What does that tell you about mankind? We were designed for relationships,” Calvaletto said. “People are hurting because of broken relationships — I can only tell them it takes time to heal some of these things.”</p>\n<p>Calvaletto said although he identifies as a conservative Catholic, he is not here to argue his beliefs, despite rumours on social media sites like Reddit.</p>\n<p>“I’m open and honest talking about a relationship with God,” Calvaletto said. “I’m not here to argue; I’m here to be a light and I do believe God loves all these students but it’s not about a religion, it’s about a relationship.”</p>\n<p>Armistead said she was fine with him conversing with students so long as he does not provide academic counseling.</p>\n<p>“My biggest concern wasn’t in terms of what his opinion was; it was that he wasn’t trying to provide anything that was university business,” Armistead said.<br>\nThird-year economics major Christopher Wong said Calvaletto has a lot to offer students on campus.</p>\n<p>“He’s cool, just doing his thing, posting at the corner with his 5 cents sign, probably the most productive 5 cents you can give somebody,” Wong said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Oct. 1 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64955\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/larry-calvaletto-returns-to-his-popular-question-booth/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64955\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/larry-calvaletto-returns-to-his-popular-question-booth/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/larry-calvaletto-returns-to-his-popular-question-booth/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/larry-calvaletto-returns-to-his-popular-question-booth/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/larry-calvaletto-returns-to-his-popular-question-booth/","id":2710,"author":{"id":132,"name":"Vicky Munro"},"related":[2709,2708,2707],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
