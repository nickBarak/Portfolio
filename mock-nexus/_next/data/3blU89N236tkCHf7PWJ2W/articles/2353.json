We have to celebrate like we own the place — because we do.”</p>\n<p>“We are many, and they are few,” added Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval, professor of Chican@ studies.</p>\n<p>Eric Smith, professor of political science, told the <em>Nexus</em> on Tuesday that the national pushback and activism in response to the Trump administration is similar to the state of the nation in the 1960s during the Vietnam War.</p>\n<p>He explained that the U.S. must have a two-party political system in order to maintain balance. He said, however, the polarization between liberal and conservative Americans grew stronger during the presidential election campaign.</p>\n<p>Smith noted the way the UCSB campus has experienced its own polarization in the past few years and encouraged the university to host more events that bridge the divide between liberal and conservative students.</p>\n<p>Smith added, however, that there has been destructive actions on both sides. College Republicans’ signs announcing Ben Shapiro were vandalized with spray paint in February.</p>\n<p>“The majority of the campus is liberal on social issues,” Smith said. “Conservatives are feeling attacked and because of that, they’re afraid to speak out in public.”</p>\n<p>In April 2016, controversial pro-Trump graffiti was written in chalk on the ground near the North Hall mural and South Hall, which holds the Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies.</p>\n<p>“If they felt more comfortable speaking up, there would be less of [those] personal attacks,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Klawunn told the <em>Nexus</em> on Wednesday that since the election, the university has mobilized efforts to create more spaces for students to discuss controversial issues.</p>\n<p>The UCSB chapter of Young Americans for Liberty began hosting events in the Hub in the UCen to open the dialogue on campus about oftentimes controversial topics. In October, the group organized a debate on free speech in relation to extremist groups.</p>\n<p>The group also organized a discussion on the ethics of abortion on Wednesday, Nov. 8.</p>\n<p>Klawunn said the university plans to hold another forum about free speech during Winter Quarter to encourage students on both sides of the issue to voice their opinions.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to continue to have different opportunities,” Klawunn said. “Each opportunity can’t do everything but we hope we’ll offer a lot of different perspectives.”</p>\n<p>Vilna Bashi Treitler, professor and chair of the black studies department, said at the forum that she feels “optimistic” about the future because she has seen the way Americans have mobilized in response to the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>“Oppression and dominance have been with us and may always be with us,” Treitler said. “We get knocked down but we can get back up again.”</p>\n<p>After the forum, the event moved to Storke Plaza, where attendees held blue LED lights and listened to the Chumash Inter-tribal Singers perform songs of survival and resilience.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on

The dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Nov. 2, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

The <em>Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-will-spend-up-to-40k-on-ads-discouraging-deltopia-crowds/\">reported</a> in February that the university spent $30,000 on advertisements for Halloween weekend last year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advertisements are one of the ways the university has tried to curb attendance during party weekends like Halloween and Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada said the campus-wide efforts build on the student-based “keep it local” initiative, a campaign that runs television and radio advertisements throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs sends letters to college students throughout California that outline regulations that could impact students if they choose to attend Halloween in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university also sends letters to local junior high and high schools urging students to not celebrate Halloween in I.V.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katya Armistead, dean of student life, said the Office of Student Life met with representatives from Associated Students and UC Isla Vista in the beginning of Fall Quarter to share the content of the advertisements and receive feedback. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Batsheva Stoll, external vice president of local affairs, said she appreciates the university’s efforts to decrease attendance in I.V. during Halloween weekend but said the advertisements are an expensive option and can provoke misunderstanding.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ads themselves can give I.V. a bad rap by making it seem like a scary hostile place when it’s our home and our community,” Stoll said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kelly Hoover, spokesperson for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s office (SBSO), the turnout for Halloween weekend has steadily decreased over the past three years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SBSO estimated that “several hundred” people were in I.V. for Halloween weekend last year, Hoover said, a significant decrease from the 13,000 partygoers that visited I.V. in 2013. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Santa Barbara Police Department (UCPD) will have about 55 officers patrolling I.V. this weekend, said Sgt. Rob Romero, UCPD spokesperson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD will also source officers from four other University of California campuses to assist in patrolling, including officers from San Diego, Riverside, Irvine and San Francisco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hoover said there will still be a strong law enforcement presence in I.V. this weekend, despite the decreased turnout in recent years. The SBSO does not release the number of officers assigned to an operation for safety reasons, Hoover said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been really pleased with what we’ve seen in the last couple of years, with students really having pride in their community and their school and wanting to keep Isla Vista safe,” Hoover said.</span></p><div

Users also have the option to attach a large umbrella to the back of the chair.</p>\n<p>Beachgoers can access the chair free of charge at the Adventure Program’s Campus Point Rentals center or through the Rec Cen.</p>\n<p>Cathy Czuleger, senior associate director for programming, information technology and development for the Department of Recreation, said the Rec Cen first purchased the beach wheelchair with funding from the Adapted Recreation Program 10 years ago.</p>\n<p>The Adapted Recreation Program is a Santa Barbara organization that provides outdoor services to community members with special needs.</p>\n<p>She said when the program ended, the wheelchair became “rusty and unusable” so the Rec Cen contacted CF to fund a new chair.</p>\n<p>The Rec Cen proposed the project to CF and applied for funding during winter 2016, said Peter Min, outreach coordinator for CF.</p>\n<p>“The program ended, and the wheelchair was not maintained or easily available for use during the past 10 years,” Min said.</p>\n<p>Czuleger said she decided to write a proposal to CF requesting money to purchase a new chair and said she was happy with the organization’s “generous” funding allocation.</p>\n<p>According to Min, CF accepts proposals for research, projects and internships every quarter and critically reviews them to see if they are compatible with the organization’s mission statement, the student community and their goal to preserve the shoreline and marine life.</p>\n<p>CF receives funds from all UCSB students through a lock-in student fee every quarter. Each undergraduate student contributes $5.75 per quarter and each graduate student contributes $3.00 per quarter.</p>\n<p>CF provides over $350,000 each year to preserve UCSB’s beaches and has distributed over $3 million locally since the fall of 1999.</p>\n<p>If students wish to earn funding for their own group or organization, they can participate in CF’s restoration projects and beach clean-ups.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79514\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-03/beach-wheelchair-now-available-at-campus-point/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79514\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-03/beach-wheelchair-now-available-at-campus-point/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-03/beach-wheelchair-now-available-at-campus-point/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-03/beach-wheelchair-now-available-at-campus-point/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-03/beach-wheelchair-now-available-at-campus-point/","id":2352,"author":{"id":177,"name":"Kayla Larson"},"related":[2351,2350,2349],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
