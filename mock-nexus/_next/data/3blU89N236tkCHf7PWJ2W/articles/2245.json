During the investigation, Martinez’s charges were listed among the search results. The <em>Nexus </em>then obtained police arrest records for the charges in question.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara Police Department (UCPD) officers first arrested Martinez on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive in Isla Vista at approximately 11:40 a.m. on Feb. 14, according to arrest records. Martinez was charged with inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant.</p>\n<p>She was booked in the Santa Barbara Jail on $25,000 bail and was released around 1 a.m. on Feb. 15, according to arrest records.</p>\n<p>Martinez pleaded not guilty. A settlement conference will be held in September, according to Santa Barbara trial court records. Martinez is being tried as a defendant against the People of the State of California.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.occourts.org/self-help/restrainingorders/criminalrestrainingorders.html\">criminal protective order</a>, which requires a “restrained person” not to “hurt, threaten, or communicate with the other person,” was filed on March 14, according to court records.</p>\n<p>In a separate incident, California Highway Patrol (CHP) stopped Martinez on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive in I.V. on March 1 at approximately 1:50 a.m. on charges of driving under the influence with a blood alcohol percent of over 0.08 percent, according to arrest records.</p>\n<p>Martinez is also being charged with possession of a controlled substance, according to court records. The charge is not present in the arrest records, however.</p>\n<p>She was cited with a $5,000 bail and was released from the Santa Barbara Jail around 11:20 p.m. later that day, according to arrest records.</p>\n<p>An arraignment will be held for the DUI charges on June 26, according to court records.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/live-a-s-election-results-2018/\">Martinez was elected</a> in late April and officially sworn in as Student Advocate General (S.A.G.) last Thursday. The S.A.G. works within the Office of Student Advocate, which works to help students who “face charges from the University in housing, academic, social conduct, and public interest matters,” according to the OSA website.</p>\n<p>Martinez also served as a letters and science senator on the A.S. Senate during the 2017-2018 school year. She declined to comment for this story.</p>\n<p><em>Shomik Mukherjee contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of the article appeared on p.5 of the May 31 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

beginning Fall Quarter 2018, which would allow students to take courses specific to journalism that are taught by trained professionals.</p>\n<p>The professional certificate program will be an 18-unit program that can be completed over the course of students’ enrollment at UCSB and will combine journalism classes already offered at UCSB, such as “Journalism News &amp; Writing,” with new courses.</p>\n<p>The classes will also be taught by new professors who have been recruited for specialty and expertise courses, according to Gretchen Macchiarella, the new data-driven journalism lecturer.</p>\n<p>“They have been really reaching out and finding journalists and educators who have connection to the industry and who are bringing in this breadth of knowledge,” Macchiarella said.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the program is to provide students the opportunity to gain specialized and modern training in the journalism field from experienced journalists, according to the program’s website.</p>\n<p>Throughout the duration of the program, students will create a professional website that exhibits the skills they have gained, from gathering facts and following leads to presenting news on social media and other platforms, according to the certificate website.</p>\n<p>The journalism certificate program was modeled after the Technology Management Certificate program also offered at UCSB Extension, according to Nomi Morris, UCSB lecturer and former international journalist.</p>\n<p>UCSB Extension is a program within the school for students pursuing continuing education.</p>\n<p>The journalism program will require students to take 12 of the 18 program units through UCSB classes and six units from the Extension program.</p>\n<p>Students will be required to pay separately for courses taken through Extension, according to the certificate program’s website. The estimated cost for the total required units needed for the certificate is $1,800.</p>\n<p>Each unit of a course offered through the UCSB Extension for this program costs $275, according to the certificate program’s website.</p>\n<p>Some of the new courses offered through Extension include “Data-Driven Journalism” and “Visual Journalism,” which aim to incorporate the “cutting-edge” changes in the journalism industry into the certificate program at UCSB, Sorapure said.</p>\n<p>The “International Reporting” course at Extension gives students an opportunity to gain “hands-on experience” in international reporting through a three-phase international reporting trip, according to the program’s website.</p>\n<p>The course will take place in Spring Quarter 2019 and carry on into the summer. It will begin with a research and story preparation phase, followed by a two-week foreign reporting trip before finishing in Santa Barbara with a presentation ceremony of the coursework to friends and family.</p>\n<p>It will count toward four units for the Extension requirement. Next year’s trip is planned to take place in Berlin, Germany during Summer 2019, according to Morris.</p>\n<p>Madeleine Sorapure, director of UCSB’s writing program, and Bob York, interim dean at UCSB Extension, began planning for the program during Fall Quarter 2017.</p>\n<p>The two began by discussing a possible collaboration between the writing program and UCSB Extension. The potential for a journalism program came up as a natural fit during these discussions, Sorapure said.</p>\n<p>“It just seemed like sort of a natural certificate program because of the professional aspect of it … There’s something about it that’s very kind of one foot in UCSB, one foot in the world,” Sorapure said.</p>\n<p>Morris said she has noticed a desire among students for opportunities to further an interest in journalism.</p>\n<p>“There are opportunities in the campus to work on campus journalism, but there are only a few journalism courses that are offered in the writing program … Part of what we’re doing is trying to address that,” Morris said.</p>\n<p>The courses offered in the program can benefit students interested in all types of careers in a professional field, according to Morris.</p>\n<p>“It’s so important right now to train people in how to write for media. Even if you don’t end up a professional journalist, these courses that we’re offering, they’re really fundamental to modern communications in the professional world, whatever you go into,” Morris said.</p>\n<p>Students can begin registering for the first class available for the certificate program, Writing 24, during their pastimes on G.O.L.D.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the May 24, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The stated goal of the forum was to foster “constructive and respectful debate,” according to UCSB College Republicans president Leslie Garcia.</p>\n<p>During the group discussion portion, participants broke into roughly six groups ranging from five to ten members.</p>\n<p>Discussion was guided by the following three questions, which were displayed on a screen at the front of the room:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do you believe that the right to due process has served the purpose envisioned by the authors of the Constitution?</li>\n<li>Does due process help to facilitate justice?</li>\n<li>Is the principle “innocent until proven guilty” the best way for organizing a legal system?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While the discussion questions focused on the legal implications of due process, participants also heavily discussed Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings and the national uproar left in the wake of his confirmation.</p>\n<p>Speakers then shifted the topic from due process in the legal system to due process in public life. Eleven participants volunteered to speak during the open mic and were given a maximum of two minutes each.</p>\n<p>California College Republicans co-chair Andrew Gates stressed the necessity of maintaining due process, even in the court of public opinion. He advocated for the reflection of constitutional values in American culture throughout the discussion.</p>\n<p>“Even though it is technically true that we don’t have to abide by the stringent standard of due process that a court of law has to abide by, in cases like Kavanaugh…we should live in the spirit of the constitutional principles,” he said.</p>\n<p>A minority of people disagreed with Gates, stating that due process should not apply outside of the legal system.</p>\n<p>Fourth year mathematics major Dylan Pizzo spoke about the infeasibility of applying due process in the real world.</p>\n<p>“Suppose you’re looking at prospective hires. An applicant…at their previous job were accused of embezzling, and it turned out to be inconclusive whether they did it or not,” Pizzo said.</p>\n<p>“The probability that they are an embezzler is much higher now… [supporters of cultural due process] are saying that an employer should hire this person…even if the probability that they are an embezzler is much higher.”</p>\n<p>Some speakers chose to focus on misconduct allegations, specifically sexual misconduct allegations with little direct evidence, such as first year political science major Ally Baker. She questioned whether the testimony of an accuser should be sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p>“As important as testimonies are…there comes a point when you do need more evidence,” she said. “Are personal testimonies considered evidence?”</p>\n<p>Gates denounced the notion that accusers should be sided with when little evidence is available, pointing to the destructive effect that false accusations can have on the lives of the accused.</p>\n<p>“I really worry about a society where just because the person is a woman and just because there does exist this terrible tragedy of rape that we automatically have to believe every accuser who comes forward. I think that’s bullshit,” Gates said.</p>\n<p>“I think that people downplay the effect that a false accusation can have…Let’s say that the studies that the feminists put forward are true, that 2 to 10 percent are false accusations. Even if it were 2 percent, like that’s fucking crazy to me.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said she was pleased with the way the forum went.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot of very constructive and respectful discussion, and it seemed that a lot of people in the room had different opinions on the questions that were posed,” she said.</p>\n<p>As the school year progresses, UCSB College Republicans hopes to hold additional monthly forums to provide spaces for debate on controversial topics, according to Garcia.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84708\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-college-republicans-host-public-forum-to-debate-validity-of-cultural-due-process/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84708\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-college-republicans-host-public-forum-to-debate-validity-of-cultural-due-process/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-college-republicans-host-public-forum-to-debate-validity-of-cultural-due-process/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-college-republicans-host-public-forum-to-debate-validity-of-cultural-due-process/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-college-republicans-host-public-forum-to-debate-validity-of-cultural-due-process/","id":2244,"author":{"id":231,"name":"Eric Wang"},"related":[2243,2242,2241],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
