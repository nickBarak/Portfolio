Creighton attempted 17 shots overall, including twelve attempts in the first half that yielded two goals.</p>\n<p>Both of Creighton’s goals were scored on dead-ball plays, the first a penalty against junior forward Sam Garza within the box just seven minutes into the first half. Garza’s foul call was met with frustration from the UCSB sideline and allowed Creighton’s Bruno Castro to put the Blue Jays up 1-0 on the PK.</p>\n<p>“It was about the worst way to start a game,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We were very confused as to what the call even was. He had told Sam Garza not to hold [Creighton’s Ethan Finlay] and Sam said he was not holding him, but obviously referee saw differently.”</p>\n<p>A second goal came just ten minutes later when Andrew Ribeiro was able to connect on a corner kick play. Ribeiro’s low strike on the ground after a deflection was made amidst a swarm of blue and white jerseys, and crept past junior goalkeeper Andre Grandt to push the Blue Jay lead to 2-0, a margin that UCSB was unable to overcome.</p>\n<p>“It was really tough coming back from two goals down early on,” Sarle said. “We had a chance in the last ten minutes but it’s always tough going down two like that. Especially against Creighton who has only given up a handful of goals all year.”</p>\n<p>The game was physical throughout the 90-minute stretch. Questionable calls toward the end of regulation were met with furious reactions from the UCSB sideline, including the ejection of assistant coach Greg Curry with just over five minutes remaining in the game. The ejection came after Curry’s reaction toward a yellow-card call against senior midfielder Luis Silva that sent a Creighton player to the ground in front of the UCSB bench. Two yellow cards were issued to Creighton, while three were given to UCSB. The Gauchos also received two red cards, both with under five minutes remaining in the match.</p>\n<p>Grandt had arguably his best performance of the year with a season-high eight saves throughout the match. Opoku led all shooters with three shots. League-leading scorer Luis Silva was held to just two shot attempts, and none on goal.</p>\n<p>Silva finishes his collegiate career ranked fifth in the nation with 17 goals and third in the nation in total points with 44, which also ties him for No. 1 in UCSB history for points in a season.</p>\n<p>With the loss, UCSB’s 2011 campaign comes to an end. Creighton advances to the next round of the NCAA tournament and will host the winner of New Mexico vs. USF.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43273\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-27/gauchos-defeated-creighton-ncaas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43273\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-27/gauchos-defeated-creighton-ncaas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-27/gauchos-defeated-creighton-ncaas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-27/gauchos-defeated-creighton-ncaas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-27/gauchos-defeated-creighton-ncaas/","id":1651,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1650,1649,1648],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella","biography":"Not available","articles":[716,743,762,820,848,852,1078,1644,1646,1647,1648,1649,1651,1654,1662,1665,1667,1671,1672,1673,1677,1678,1679,1683,1684,1686,1688,1690,1693,1694,1695,1696,1700,1719,1757,1761,1764,1767,1768,2160,2844,4375,4473,4491,4502,4510,4511,4512,4513,4514,4515,4516,4517,4519,4520,4527,4528,4530,4532,4536,4537,4538,4542,4543,4547,4557,4559,4561,4562,4564,4565,4566,5533],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Women’s Club Brings Home National Title","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB Women’s Club Soccer Head Coach Todd Heil can finally lift his ban on a team T-shirt that reads “On the Road to Five,” as the women edged out rival Cal Poly 1-0 in Saturday’s championship ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB Women’s Club Soccer Head Coach Todd Heil can finally lift his ban on a team T-shirt that reads “On the Road to Five,” as the women edged out rival Cal Poly 1-0 in Saturday’s <img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Untitled-28.jpg?resize=141%2C264\" alt=\"\" width=\"141\" height=\"264\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">championship match to make their five-peat a reality that can’t be jinxed.

Just six minutes into the match, a through ball by Madueno was met with a powerful kick by Silva, giving UCSB the early 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>“It was ripped,” Vom Steeg said about Silva’s goal. “Silva was not only great but was on a different level on the field tonight.”</p>\n<p>Silva’s shot from 12 yards out added to his total of 17 goals on the year. At the end of Big West conference play, Silva ranked No. 6 in the nation in goals scored, and ranks No. 12 overall in goals per game with .80 as of Nov. 13.</p>\n<p>Madueno was able to add his name to the shot list at the 40:14 mark, when he received a pass on the left side of the box from sophomore forward Dom Sarle, who is currently second on the team in total assists with nine.</p>\n<p>“Josue was a real important key to the game tonight,” Vom Steeg said. “They couldn’t stay with his pace and athleticism.”</p>\n<p>Down 2-0 coming out of the halftime break, Providence was able to respond with a goal by freshman defender Brandon Adler 22 minutes into the second period. The goal came on a corner kick set and was Adler’s first of the year.</p>\n<p>“I made a curving run toward the back post and made a header,” Adler said. “One of their players tried to clear it off the line but thankfully it went over.”</p>\n<p>Less than five minutes later, Sarle was able to score on a through ball from Silva, who tallied his team-leading 10th assist of the year.</p>\n<p>“I beat [the defender] around the corner quick,” Sarle said. “He cheated near post and I slipped it by him.”</p>\n<p>Providence was able to draw a foul call within the box during the 83rd minute, allowing Anthony Baumann to deliver a penalty kick to the lower left side of the goal. The strike brought the Gaucho lead down to 3-2, where it would remain for the rest of the match.</p>\n<p>“We lost to a good team,” Providence Head Coach Chaka Daley said. “The way we played in the second half … we should have played that way in the first half.”</p>\n<p>UCSB out-shot the Friars 8-1 in the first half and 16-6 throughout the game. Providence goalkeeper Jhojan Obando recorded seven total saves during the match, and UCSB junior goalie Andre Grandt tallied two stops.</p>\n<p>UCSB advances to the third round of the tournament against Creighton next Sunday, Nov. 27.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43159\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43159\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/","id":1649,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1648,1647,1646],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops Championship vs. UCI","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A muddy night in Irvine seemed even colder for the UCSB men’s soccer team when it was defeated 3-2 in double overtime during the Big West Championship match on Saturday night.

UCSB is also likely to gain a high seeding in the NCAA tournament brackets, in large part due to a preseason schedule that yielded victories against Duke (Sept. 2) and Akron (Oct. 5).</p>\n<p>The poor field conditions only worsened as the minutes progressed throughout the game, transforming the once-green pitch into a muddy landscape of potholes and divots.</p>\n<p>“The quality of the surface on the field was not great,” Vom Steeg said. “We played Garza and on his first touch [the ball] bounced up and took away a scoring opportunity for us.”</p>\n<p>UCI was able to get off eight shots during the first half, compared to just four for UCSB, and took a 1-0 lead going into the break. UCSB responded in the 64th minute when physical play inside the goal box led to a penalty kick by Silva, who has scored on two of his three attempts this year.</p>\n<p>“Silva is the best player in the conference,” Vom Steeg said. “He played that way in the biggest game of the year. In my opinion, he’s the offensive MVP of the conference.”</p>\n<p>Silva added to his offensive attack less than five minutes later on a free kick from 23 yards outside of the box. A streaking sophomore forward Dom Sarle was able to corral the ball and touch it into the goal, giving UCSB a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Irvine had multiple opportunities in the second half to tie the score that were interrupted by the play of junior goalkeeper André Grandt. A breakaway by the UC Irvine offense forced Grandt into a one-on-one situation, where he was able to make the save.</p>\n<p>With less than 10 minutes remaining in the game, Grandt again made an influential play for the UCSB defense during a UCI free kick.</p>\n<p>“The shot was right on me and I got both hands on the ball,” Grandt said. “Next thing I know, 3-4 [Irvine] players were all sliding into me. I had both my hands on the ball so it was called a foul.”</p>\n<p>An Irvine throw-in with just two minutes remaining in regulation made its way to the front of the UCSB goal box, where it was successfully headed in by the Anteater offense. The 2-2 tie pushed the game into double overtime where UCI was able to score off of a rebounded shot and win the tournament championship.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42862\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-14/ucsb-drops-championship-uci/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42862\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-14/ucsb-drops-championship-uci/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-14/ucsb-drops-championship-uci/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-14/ucsb-drops-championship-uci/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-14/ucsb-drops-championship-uci/","id":1648,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1647,1646,1645],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
