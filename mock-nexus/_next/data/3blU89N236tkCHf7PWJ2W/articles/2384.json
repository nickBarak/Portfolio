Environmental Affairs Board and the A.S. Food Bank budget. However, $11,259.98 came directly from A.S. funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former A.S. President Austin Hechler, who has been involved in the renovation since it was brought to A.S., spoke at the opening ceremony about how UC Santa Barbara continues to lead the fight against food insecurity for the entire UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hechler also commented that it’s “truly remarkable” how preeminent the food bank is.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breanna Jones, A.S. Food Bank Committee chair and fourth-year English and film studies double major, spoke at the opening about the space’s importance to students and her hopes that the larger area will better serve its clients.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Moving forward, I really want the space to be a place where people come and feel welcome no matter what,” Jones said. “Hopefully through that we can destigmatize the notion of being food insecure.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steven </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marquardt</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, fourth-year political science major and internal affairs coordinator for the A.S. Food Bank Committee that helped push for the makeover, echoed Jones’s thoughts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think what the food bank represents is inclusive community. It’s literally for everybody, every student: undergraduate, graduate student — and whether you’re using the food bank or volunteering to help the committee or help in the food bank, there’s a role for everyone,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones said the pantry used to get upwards of 70 people crammed into one tight area, and the renovation has brought a “relief in space” that’s helped bring a “better vibe.” She hopes that it will help to further address the issue of food insecurity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have more room for storing food, which is great because now we have more options for students and can service more students,” Kathy Lopez, student coordinator for the project, said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78287\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78287\" data-attachment-id=\"78287\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/renovated-food-bank-reopens-with-hopes-for-refrigeration-and-food-recovery/img_4364-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4364.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_4364\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4364.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4364.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78287\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4364-1024x768.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4364.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4364.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4364.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4364.jpg?resize=1832%2C1374&amp;ssl=1 1832w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4364.jpg?resize=1376%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4364.jpg?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4364.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4364.jpg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4364.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_4364.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78287\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chancellor Henry T.

Food Bank, there seems to be a consensus among all staffers: refrigeration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marquardt</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> said if the food bank can get refrigeration, it can serve more food and more complete meals to students. He said the food bank plans to reduce food waste on campus by recovering food from dining establishments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We actually have people working on food recovery, and they are ready to recover food from dining commons [and] from the UCen that would be donated here, but we just aren’t ready to have it, because we don’t have refrigeration,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Executive director of A.S. Marisela Márquez said she remembers that up until 1995, A.S. was located in the area now occupied by the food bank.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This literally comes full circle, and it has always been the spirit of students before, during and after.

conquering the 14,505-foot peak located in Sequoia National Park. The group had no high-altitude training and no previous experience hiking the summit.</p>\n<p>The climbers woke up the day of the climb at 2 a.m. to begin the ascent by 3 a.m. They summited the mountain by 11:30 a.m., taking a one-hour break at the crest and then continuing down the mountain to reach the base at approximately 5:30 p.m. By midnight they arrived back in I.V., and many cadets attended class the following day.</p>\n<p>The excursion was incorporated into the ROTC preparation for the Ranger Challenge competition in Fall Quarter, during which 11 UCSB ROTC cadets compete as a team in a series of military skills events against teams of cadets from other universities around the country.</p>\n<p>ROTC cadets Dominique Chan, third-year global studies major, and Theo Vance, second-year communication major and a team captain who helped organize the climb, both described the ascent to Mt. Whitney’s peak as a mental and physical test that rivaled anything they have experienced in their cadet training.</p>\n<p>The typical hiker will take two days to make the climb, camping overnight at 10,000 to 12,000 feet to acclimate to the elevation and then summit the mountain the following day.</p>\n<p>Both Chan and Vance agreed, however, that the one-day climb made for a more rewarding endeavor, with more notable bragging rights.</p>\n<p>“I have never done something that gnarly before. I knew it would be hard. I didn’t realize it was going to be that hard,” Vance said. “But it was the comradery of it. ROTC kids are kind of tough by necessity. So just knowing that you’re not the only one being pushed, that you’re all in it together, and you start as a team, and you finish as a team.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78234\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78234\" data-attachment-id=\"78234\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/rotc-cadets-conquer-mount-whitney-in-under-15-hours/img_4218/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_4218\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78234\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218-1024x768.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=1832%2C1374&amp;ssl=1 1832w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=1376%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4218.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78234\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Dominique Chan</em></p></div>\n<p>Chan said the climb was definitely harder than she had anticipated. Though many cadets had taken Diamox prior to reaching Mt. Whitney, a diuretic that reduces the symptoms of altitude sickness, the elevation was by far the most difficult aspect to overcome and caused extreme shortness of breath and painful headaches throughout the group.</p>\n<p>“Reaching those heights in one day really starts to get at you,” Chan said. “[Elevation] really is the great equalizer and it’s quite humbling, actually … There’s still that kind of varying level of fitness, but I think it’s interesting that the most fit cadet was struggling, relatively, as much as the least fit person who went up to Mt. Whitney.”</p>\n<p>Vance said the cadets were told this was likely one of the most challenging times in the last 10 years to make the climb because of heavy snowfall this past winter.</p>\n<p>“The trail normally takes you on this marked path that has a railing and all this stuff. That was about 10 feet below us, apparently, from all the snow,” Vance said.</p>\n<p>He added that the use of ice axes and crampons, traction devices attached to footwear for improved stability, were “absolutely vital” because the path was difficult to navigate.</p>\n<p>Vance said the warm weather made for a beautiful day to climb but also increased the difficulty of the ascent.</p>\n<p>“[The snow] was very soft, very sludgy, and that’s very dangerous on this portion called the chute, which is kind of the steepest part,” Vance said.<br>\nThe cadets made the climb up the snow chute, an area directly between the switchbacks and face of the mountain, in approximately an hour and a half with the help of their snow equipment.</p>\n<p>“It’s just straight absolute uphill, and you are just ice-axing it the entire way and using your crampons,” Vance said. “Even with that, you’re slipping and sliding sometimes, and you lose your footing.”</p>\n<p>“Without the crampons, we could have fallen to our death, basically, or rolled down, tumbled down,” Chan added.</p>\n<p>Vance said being comfortable with the ice equipment became critical on the descent down the snow chute, a 60-degree downhill that measures approximately 1,500 feet.</p>\n<p>“The chute, because it was so steep, there’s no way to get back down,” Vance said. “So it took us about an hour and a half, hour and 40 to get up, and for me personally it took about 35 seconds to get down.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78236\" style=\"width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78236\" data-attachment-id=\"78236\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/rotc-cadets-conquer-mount-whitney-in-under-15-hours/img_4248/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?fit=960%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_4248\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78236\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4248.jpg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78236\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Dominique Chan</em></p></div>\n<p>The cadets trekked through varied terrain throughout the day, with changes in environment coming quickly with little warning.</p>\n<p>“When you’re coming up, it’s just kind of mountain wilderness,” Vance said. “Then eventually, out of nowhere, it just turns into snowy woods … The higher you get it just becomes more and more just kind of rocks and boulders and just snow. Then, once you get past the chute, it’s just all mountain range. Once you’re up at the steep portion, you go behind this ridgeline, and pretty much there you can see just for miles, just mountain tops.”</p>\n<p>“At that point you’re going single file, so you get to the hardest part, and then single file, you’re hugging the side of a mountain,” Chan added. “That’s like 13,000 feet, so the last part is only a thousand-foot climb, but it’s just, like, two more miles of just making your way up there.”</p>\n<p>Vance said while the snow made the journey more challenging, it also added to the beauty of the scenery.</p>\n<p>“You can see just mountain ranges on mountain ranges and you can see the lakes and rivers and stuff, but they’re frozen over,” Vance said. “It’s kind of interesting to see the different tints of snow because you can pick out different landmarks, but it’s still just all snow. It’s really beautiful.”</p>\n<p>Cadets who wanted to make the climb trained throughout Spring Quarter at 5:30 a.m. three days a week for an hour prior to their required ROTC workouts at 6:30 a.m. The group also met Wednesday nights for skills training, for a total of four additional hours of training a week.</p>\n<p>“The team that wanted to come out, we had tryouts, and kind of the incentive for them to work hard this quarter was that at the end we would climb Mt. Whitney,” Vance said. “The training was kind of geared around getting people in shape for Ranger Challenge and teaching them stuff that they would need to know but also to prepare for Whitey as well.”</p>\n<p>Both Chan and Vance said they packed only granola bars and water to sustain themselves through the climb.</p>\n<p>“I had probably a 25-pound pack and half of it was probably water. I didn’t end up drinking all of it, but it was important that some people brought more for the people that brought less because a lot of people ran out along the way,” Vance said.</p>\n<p>Chan said as an inexperienced climber she appreciated all the research the team captains put into preparing for the trip to ensure the entire group’s safety.</p>\n<p>“The team captains made sure to really study up and research what was needed ahead of time to really make sure to take care of their people,” Chan said. “Overall, not only was it a really cool adventure, but I think it was a really good leadership training exercise for the people who were in charge of this trip.”</p>\n<p>Vance said although four members of the group had to turn back due to altitude sickness, he was still very happy that the remaining 12 were able to reach the summit with little trouble.</p>\n<p>“We all came back as a group,” Vance said. “I was very, very impressed with how many people got through it, considering how tough it was and just the conditions … like the sheer brutality of it, because altitude sickness is one of those things you can’t train for.”</p>\n<p>Chan said team comradery motivated the cadets to reach to the top, as they relied on each other for support to push their physical and mental boundaries.</p>\n<p>“There were definitely periods of just silence, I think mostly because people were just so tired and so focused that it would take even more energy to even talk,” Chan said. “But I don’t think I could have made it up there without all my friends.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, June 1, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

I wasn’t always a gloomy shmuck.</p>\n<p>Part of it is that I blew my shoulder out on a nothing-special head-high wave this winter break, just trying to avoid running some kook over.</p>\n<p>Now I’m faced with a shoulder injury that has had me out of the water and unable to do more than lift my backpack for the last month. With no hope for a quick recovery in sight, my surf withdrawals are getting hectic. I creep out my surf peers in my crippled state, standing on my balcony and sighing as I watch the waves roll in. The past two weeks of solid swell have been particularly hard to overcome.</p>\n<p>Today I realized that my next quarter will be my last here. And given the funk I’m already in, I couldn’t help but dwell on regrets that I’ve steadily tried to deny.</p>\n<p>Some were pretty mundane. I could’ve done more schoolwork. I could’ve raged less. It might have done me well to see past the beer goggles on occasion. I could’ve conducted myself with accountability in mind.</p>\n<p>Not shockingly, my most striking regret is that I didn’t surf more.</p>\n<p>In retrospect, I’d probably be a happier person right now if I had skipped class and gone surfing a couple dozen more times every quarter. I think I’d top the dean’s list, be less sloppy and more driven if I had gotten up for the sunrise every day.</p>\n<p>Sure, waves might not always reach expectations, but if you set your minimum surf quota at taking a paddle in placid Lake Pacific, a surf session is about the most wholesome thing there is. Even the tiniest little urine-splatter-sized ripple of a wave can appease your soul.</p>\n<p>At the same time, time between sessions can be some of the most agonizing tear-out-your-face-with-a-crowbar periods of your life.</p>\n<p>Do you remember the story of Anton Pavlov, and his experiments with conditioning? Long story short, dogs were found to begin salivating at the sound of a bell because it made them anticipate a meal. Trained to come to dinner at the sound of a bell, they would even salivate when a bell rang even without the meal being prepared.</p>\n<p>Surfing has a similar effect on me.  Well, not completely similar — no one cut a hole in my belly — but I have been conditioned by the pursuit of surf. Now, the dull roar of waves from my I.V. bedroom, the mention of a barrel, the sight of a set from my DP apartment and any moment of weakness when I boot up Surfline all get the surf juices flowing. But now that I can’t dig into the juicy surf buffet that I.V. has been offering the past few weeks, my manifest surf destiny has become a burden.</p>\n<p>So learn from me. Now that I am wary of surfing for fear of re-injury, I can see all the missed opportunities.</p>\n<p>Sure, you may have that business presentation with the TMP program that you can’t show up to all salty with I.V. run-off dripping out of your nose.  And you’ve got that fucking midterm tomorrow already and you haven’t bought the course reader yet.

Students can expect to receive an email invitation to join Handshake around June 16. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Career Services suggests students download any important documents from Gaucholink before the end of Spring Quarter.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Gaucholink, Handshake connects students to employers and provides potential internship opportunities by allowing students to share their resumes and search and apply for jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Career Services counselor and coordinator Eric Wilder said </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handshake allows students to create a “more in-depth profile,” which he said will allow them to more easily find jobs and internships as well as interact with employers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employers searching to recruit college students are able to access Handshake and view the resumes of applicants, which are directly displayed on the students’ profiles, and post employment or internship opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handshake is designed to provide organizations with a “single login experience” in which they can find all the necessary information about a student on one interface. Career Services staffers believe this will encourage employers to interact more with the website and the students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Career Services expects Handshake to provide an “easier” and more “user-friendly” interface that will increase communication between companies and students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB students can access a much wider array of employment and internship opportunities [with Handshake],” Wilder said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website also uses algorithms “similar to the ones on Netflix” to match students with jobs or internships that correspond to their interests and areas of study. It is for this reason that Handshake provides a more “fluid experience” for both students and employers, Wilder said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handshake additionally allows students to look for career fairs, establish interviews with prospective employers and search for other career-related events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are looking into future rollouts that will allow students to easily identify career events and resources that match their interests,” Wilder said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78196\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78196\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-29/career-services-to-replace-gaucholink-with-new-jobs-database/","id":2383,"author":{"id":81,"name":"Victoria Gurrola"},"related":[2382,2381,2380],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
