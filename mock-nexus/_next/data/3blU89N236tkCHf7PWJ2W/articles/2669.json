may have taken pictures under the bathroom stall doors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Authorities say an Asian male, described as 5 feet 8 inches and wearing a UCSB sweatshirt, jeans and a black backpack was seen walking into women’s restrooms in the library between 7 and 8 on Saturday night.</span></p>\n<p>“In one instance he was seen putting a cell phone under the bathroom stall door, possibly taking pictures,” UCPD said in an email sent to the campus community.</p>\n<p>Police are currently searching for the subject, who was last seen leaving the library heading west toward Isla Vista, according to UCPD.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone who knows the suspect or has any additional information is encouraged by UCPD to call the department at 805-893-3446 or make an <a href=\"http://www.police.ucsb.edu/contact-us/report-crime\" target=\"_blank\">anonymous report on their website</a>.</span></p><div

A panel of women comprised of two Planned Parenthood representatives, two Student Health representatives and two UCSB Women’s Center representatives discussed a variety of different methods for birth control. The six women dispelled common myths about each type of birth control, answered questions from attendees and demonstrated the usage of certain contraceptives with plastic models.</p>\n<p>Events for Love Your Body Week include pumpkin carving on Wednesday, a Zumba lesson on Thursday and a henna and body art activity taking place on Friday.</p>\n<p>Third-year biology major Marisa Allan said she attended the event to inquire about birth control pills and came away with knowledge on various other forms of birth control such as an Internal Uterine Device (IUD).</p>\n<p>“I like the open discussion because it takes the ‘sex is bad’ stigma away from talking about this,” Allan said. “I’d rather everyone be informed than regret something they might do.”</p>\n<p>Second-year math major Tao Nguyen, who tabled for Love Your Body Week on Monday, said she volunteered to be a part of the event because she wanted to be involved in an organization that provided “outreach for anyone.” According to Nguyen, loving your body includes loving your physical body as well as your sexuality.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65620\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a

Nguyen said. “There’s this standard of heterosexual, feminine females and masculine males, which are the two types that are portrayed, but there is so much diversity that we shouldn’t just be accepting our own but cut others, too.”</p>\n<p>Second-year psychology major Lauren Paiste said she attended the discussion to learn more about basic contraceptive methods.</p>\n<p>“The open discussion was nice; I felt more comfortable because everyone was talking,” Paiste said.</p>\n<p>Second-year biology and sociology double-major and a student staff member for the Women’s Center Eyra Dordi said Love Your Body Week is about “body positivity” and the discussions surrounding it.</p>\n<p>“We think [body positivity] is really important at the Women’s Center, specifically to women, but also to absolutely everybody; the way that people’s bodies are talked about, and the way they’re controlled,” Dordi said.</p>\n<p>For more information on Love Your Body Week check the Love Your Body

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>With about 24 hours until UC Santa Barbara’s spring concert on Sunday, many non-students are still trying to snag a ticket. But the concert, Extravaganza, is only open to UCSB students, meaning that tickets come in the form of borrowed — or purchased — student ID cards.</p>\n<p>Several students have already been referred to UCSB’s Office of Judicial Affairs for trying to rent or sell their IDs to non-UCSB students, and a Facebook search returned more than 40 posts either seeking or selling a student access card.</p>\n<p>Sarah Yang, who graduated from UCSB after Winter Quarter, wanted to go to the concert but is visiting Las Vegas with friends instead.</p>\n<p>She decided to make some extra cash by posting her ID on Facebook and received about 10 offers ranging from $20 to $50. In the end, though, Yang passed up on the money and gave her ID to a friend who needed one.</p>\n<p>“I understand why they want to close it off — we all pay our tuition,” Yang said. “We’ve had Deltopia and we’ve had crazy riots happening and I understand why they want to keep it within the school.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students Program Board (ASPB), the student-funded organization hosting the concert, has hired professional security for the event and instructed them to look for certain things on students’ ID cards.</p>\n<p>“We gave them specific instructions — this is what the card has to look like, you have to make sure the face matches the card, you have to make sure it’s not scratched out to where you can’t see the face,” said Alex Levine, the special events coordinator for ASPB.</p>\n<p>Levine said that while ASPB does have machines to scan the ID cards, she is not sure if they will be used on Sunday, but Program Board has been monitoring social media sites and referring students to Judicial Affairs.</p>\n<p>Katya Armistead, the dean of student life, said students who are flagged as having sold their ID card will, at the very least, have to speak with an administrator.</p>\n<p>“There’s not a set consequence. I would definitely at the very least call the student in to have a conversation,” Armistead said, adding that “it’s not a witch hunt.”</p>\n<p>Armistead said she knows this has been a problem for years, but was surprised, this year, when she saw people pop up on her own Facebook feed selling IDs.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a problem, it’s happened before, but I’d never seen it — me, I see it!” she said.</p>\n<p>One first-year UCSB student, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because selling and buying ID cards is against school policy, said she sees why the students-only policy exists, but wanted to be able to bring her boyfriend.</p>\n<p>“It’s understandable, like I get it, but it sucks, you know?” she said. “I totally understand it, but I’m still trying to get around it.”</p>\n<p>The first-year student posted on Facebook looking to buy an ID for $15. She was contacted by someone renting out their ID for $45, far more than she was willing to pay.</p>\n<p>“It might be worth it if it was a concert ticket, but it’s just an access card, you know,” said the student, who is still looking for a way to bring her boyfriend to Extravaganza on Sunday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

the Beauty, Brains and Everything in Between forum as a part of Hermanas Unidas’ Raza (Race) week Tuesday in North Hall.</p>\n<p>At the forum, members of the three organizations discussed the challenges women of color face on a university campus. Raza Week will also include events such as a potluck, movie night and a Salsa night with organizations such as the Pan-African Student Union, El Congresso and La Familia de Colores.</p>\n<p>Hermanas Unidas representative and third-year feminist studies and sociology double-major Regina Ramirez said Hermanas Unidas hosted Raza Week to provide organizations with an opportunity to network.</p>\n<p>“We can be such a big support system for one another, mostly being women, and mostly being underrepresented,” Ramirez said.</p>\n<p>Ramirez said she was “really excited” about co-hosting Beauty, Brains and Everything in Between because it brought diverse women together to share their experiences.</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, Beauty, Brains and Everything in Between is “empowering” and motivating for students who may struggle at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“There is a lot of struggles that we as women of color go through, not just with academics, but also how we see ourselves within campus,” Ramirez said. “It’s really helpful because we’re sharing our experiences.”</p>\n<p>Sigma Theta Psi Multicultural Chair, Co-host of the event and third-year feminist studies and sociology double-major Carina Garibay said she feels categorized by her ethnicity instead of individual qualities. According to Garibay, university environments would benefit from professors and other faculty properly considering the needs of women of color.</p>\n<p>“Professors have such an influence on how we feel on campus as well, as women and as women of color,” Garibay said.</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Patsy Solano said women of color often feel out of place as science, technology, math and engineering majors.</p>\n<p>“We’re looked down upon and not given much hope,” Solano said.</p>\n<p>Second-year Chican@ studies and sociology double-major Casandra Phillips said institutional changes should include “seeing more women and women of color at a higher level” to promote students utilizing their resources.</p>\n<p>According to Phillips, women of color should not “victimize themselves.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, we are women of color, but we’re just people like everyone else,” Phillips said. “I don’t have to prove anything to anyone but myself, I’m here for myself.”</p>\n<p>Third-year linguistics and sociology double-major Nora Rosales said the event opened doors for women to start new conversations.</p>\n<p>“If there isn’t any representation of people that look like us, or people who think like us, or been through the things we’ve been through, then how the hell are they supposed to help us?” Rosales said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Regina Ramirez is a part of Sigma Theta Psi, however she is a representative of Hermanas Unidas and not a member of the sorority.
