Fresh off a comeback victory against UC Davis this Wednesday and having already beaten the Mustangs once this season, the gauchos are in a great position for the weekend to come.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos host their bitter, green rival boasting a solid 9-5-2 overall record and an unbeaten 5-0-2 Big West record, good enough for first place in the entire conference with 14 total points. Cal Poly comes into town with a deflating 3-9-2 overall record and a 1-5-1 conference record placing them dead last in the entire Big West with four points.</p>\n<p>For the second straight week, these two teams will meet on Saturday night in front of an exuberant home crowd. After falling behind 1-0 early in the match just five days ago, Santa Barbara stormed back with goals from red-hot juniors Ahinga Selemani and Kevin Feucht to win the game 2-1.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The victory put the all-time record between these two squads at an even further distance as the Gauchos now lead the series all-time 46-18-8 and 23-7-6 during the Tim Vom Steeg era. The win was also a huge confidence boost as last year UCSB was winless in the two-match series going 0-1-1.</p>\n<p>Last season’s match at Harder Stadium was certainly an instant classic. The game attracted 14,919 spectators, the second-largest campus crowd in NCAA history, and ended in a stunning 2-2 tie after Cal Poly scored the equalizer with only four seconds left, overcoming what seemed to be an insurmountable 2-0 lead held by the home team for most of the match.</p>\n<p>With that being the lasting moment the remaining Gauchos had of the match against the Mustangs last year, it’s safe to say they are ready to come out and defeat them in front of what could be the largest crowd in NCAA history by the end of the night.</p>\n<p>Also on the line, Santa Barbara’s chance to sweep Cal Poly for the first time since 2006. That year also marked UCSB’s first and only national championship in program history.</p>\n<p>Hoping to deflate the home team and give them their first loss of the conference season will be senior forward Justin Dhillon who ranks third in the conference in goals scored with seven. The winger has scored 70 percent of the team’s total goals all season. His 17 total points also rank him first on his team, third in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Despite his great offense play, no other Mustang really comes to mind. Despite not scoring in last week’s match, the senior assisted in the only goal scored by Cal Poly in that game as freshman midfielder Christian Enriquez scored the first goal of his young career.</p>\n<p>One player to watch out for is Kody Wakasa. The senior defender made the shot of his life last season for his team scoring the game winning golden goal against the Gauchos in a 3-2 win at Cal Poly. This season Wakasa has registered one goal and has played exceptional in the back end, which has done a solid job despite what the overall record might entail.</p>\n<p>In fact, goalkeeper Eric Kam has been great for most of the season. The junior has the second-best goals allowed against average in the Big West with 1.21, while his save percentage of .706 ranks fourth in the conference with UCSB’s freshman goalie Tituoan Le Roux.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have been on fire as of late, especially the trio of DePuy, Selemani and Feucht. All three players are in the top-five goal scorers in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Feucht’s 10 goals rank first in the conference while also ranking seventh best in the entire nation. The midfielder scored the equalizer to help send the game into overtime against UC Davis on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Because of the Feucht’s goal, DePuy was able to score the 16th game winner of his career in front of the Aggies home stadium. Despite not having the season he had last year when he scored 15 goals and led the entire nation, the striker has still made a significant impact. In his career, the senior has scored four goals in seven appearances against the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>Last, but certainly not least on the list, is Selemani. Although not extending his goal streak to five matches after failing to score against UC Davis, the junior had the key assist to Feucht’s equalizer. In two of his three career appearances against Cal Poly, the junior has scored a goal and his six goals this season rank second best on the team, tied with DePuy.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73271\" style=\"width: 333px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73271\" data-attachment-id=\"73271\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-19/gauchos-head-to-uc-davis-to-continue-recent-unbeaten-run/jenny-luo-daily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C2400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,2400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-73271\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web-683x1024.jpg?resize=323%2C485\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"323\" height=\"485\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-73271\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>On the back end, the Gauchos have been solid thanks to the play of freshman Le Roux. The goalkeeper ranks third in the conference with 60 saves and has not allowed more than one goal in his last six matches; he is a respectable player, having done all this without missing a single minute in 16 starts this season.</p>\n<p>While, on paper, Santa Barbara clearly looks like the more dominant team, Cal Poly certainly has the tenacity to make this an interesting match. If last Saturday’s match was any indicator, the Gauchos might have their hands full this weekend if they are not careful.</p>\n<p>As recognized by most fans of college soccer, the Blue-Green clash is the best soccer rivalry in college soccer to date, and with that title comes the responsibility to give fans the greatest game they could possibly witness. Something tells me this match, like all the others that have been played, will not disappoint.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos face off against the Mustangs in the annual Blue-Green rivalry on Saturday, Oct. 22, at 8 p.m. at Harder Stadium.

Senior forward Matt Wiesenfarth played the hero in that game, scoring his fourth goal of the season on a breakaway in the 93rd minute.</p>\n<p>In UCSB and UC Davis’ two meetings this season, the Gauchos came away victorious thanks to three goals from sophomore holding midfielder Kevin Feucht, all of which came from the penalty spot.</p>\n<p>“The fact that we’ve gotten three goals from the spot means that we’re doing some damage in the box,” Selemani said. “Obviously you want to get goals in other fashions, but I think the fact that we’re getting goals is important and the fact we’re getting wins is all that matters right now.”</p>\n<p>In the two teams’ first meeting at Harder Stadium, the Gauchos lost a 1-0 lead after conceding a 74th minute goal to junior Steven Guzman. It was a trademark goal for Davis that was characteristic of the gameplan it has continued to utilize against UCSB, being scored by a defender following a scramble off a long throw into the box.</p>\n<p>“We have to have high pressure and keep them from scoring set piece goals because that’s where they’re most dangerous,” junior left back Ismaila Jome said. “Their two center backs have their most goals, so if we just keep them from getting any headers in the box and play as well as we have throughout the season we’ll be fine.”</p>\n<p>However, junior forward Nick DePuy was dragged down in the box just 50 seconds after the Aggies’ equalizer, leading to Feucht’s second penalty of the game and eventual game-winner.</p>\n<p>Davis brings to town a physical, sluggish style that serves as somewhat of a foil to UCSB’s more traditional approach of passing and making good runs into the box. The Gauchos ended the season with the eighth best offense in the nation, scoring 38 goals through 19 games.</p>\n<p>“They have two guys, [sophomore forward Evan Barrett and junior forward Dashiell MacNamara], who are pretty quick,” Selemani said. “We just need to make sure we take those guys down and we have a good chance to win again.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies’ offensive attack can be summed up by the fact that its top two goal scorers during the regular season were defenders in senior Lucas Mohageg and redshirt freshman Roy Boateng. They will be looking to keep the score low as they wait for their chance to pack the box and find a goal off a good ball in or a fortunate bounce.</p>\n<p>“We work on [clearing] every practice, but especially [this week],” Selemani said. “We had everybody setting up in [Davis’] formations and defended like we would tomorrow, so hopefully that works as well and we get the result.”</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos have had great success during conference play in recent years, they have been unable to get it done when it matters most, going 0-3 over the past two postseasons. That will likely change this time around with an experienced core group that has grown together over the years.</p>\n<p>“Since I’ve been here this is the best team as far as talent-wise, just collectively,” Jome said. “We have a good mix of younger guys and older guys and we know how big of a struggle it is to get into the postseason and win games.”</p>\n<p>Under Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg, who received a record fifth conference Coach of the Year Award, UCSB’s dominant record this season was reflected in its dominance of the Big West yearly awards.</p>\n<p>Nick DePuy earned his second consecutive Big West Offensive Player of the Year after scoring 15 goals through 19 games. To put that number in perspective, the four players who tied for second in goals in the conference had less than half of DePuy’s total with seven. Only one NCAA player, USC Upstate’s Gordon Wild (16), has scored more goals than him this year.</p>\n<p>The 6-4 DePuy has been unstoppable all season thanks to a combination of size, good feet, extremely accurate shooting, and an excellent supporting cast that has given him great service. All of these factors have helped catapult him to a nation-leading eight game-winning goals. His individual success has led to the team’s success ever since he switched from the midfield to forward midway through last season, proven by UCSB’s undefeated record of 16-0-4 in games he has scored in.</p>\n<p>DePuy’s aforementioned supporting cast includes Big West Freshman of the Year Geoffrey Acheampong, who scored four goals and led the Big West with 10 assists, good for sixth-best in the country. UCSB first-year players have now won the award in four consecutive seasons and six of the past seven.</p>\n<p>The former Cate School star received a Big West Honorable Mention alongside sophomore left back Randy Mendoza and freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg.</p>\n<p>Other players joining DePuy on the All-Big West First Team were Feucht, who was second on the team with five goals, junior midfielder Josue Espana, and senior defender Duncan Backus.</p>\n<p>Selemani rounds out the long list of Gauchos receiving accolades, being named All-Big West Second Team with four goals. He ranked third in the conference with 50 shots, putting a high amount of pressure on back lines all year to help free up space for his teammates.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will benefit from having 11 nights of rest since their last game against Davis on Halloween, thanks to their winning the No. 1 seed and a bye in the first round of the postseason. In that final regular season game against the Aggies, UCSB came away with a 1-0 victory after freshman forward Cody Gibson was taken down in the box, leading to another game-winning penalty by Feucht.</p>\n<p>The winner of Wednesday’s game will face the winner between Cal Poly and Cal State Fullerton on Saturday. If the Gauchos win, they will be at home for the championship game as they look to win their first Big West title since 2010.</p>\n<p>“Tomorrow is the biggest test because we haven’t made it to the final in [four] years,” Jome said. “The biggest challenge would just be winning tomorrow, and after that, we have to take it game by game.”</p>\n<p>Tomorrow’s game begins at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Last night, thanks to a pair of trademark headers from the nation’s leading goal-scorer in junior forward Nick DePuy, the Gauchos got their revenge, taking down the Hornets 2-1 in their regular season home finale.</p>\n<p>“I’m pleased with our effort tonight,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “I thought that our players palyed a reasonably good game, especially given the bounce back from a really emotional game against Cal Poly.”</p>\n<p>At 11-5-2 overall and 6-2-1 in conference, Santa Barbara now needs a win or a tie in its season finale to hold on to first-place in the Big West North Division.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For the Hornets, the loss dropped their record to 6-9-2 overall and 3-4-1 in conference. They will need a win against Cal Poly and a UC Davis loss on Saturday to secure the final spot in the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>The seats at Harder Stadium weren’t even warm yet before DePuy got his team on the board less than two minutes into the game. After UCSB won a free kick deep in the left midfield, freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong played a long ball towards senior defender Duncan Backus at the far post.</p>\n<p>Despite a difficult angle, Backus redirected a header back across goal right where DePuy was making his run, and he knocked it in to open the scoring. The goal was the fastest scored for UCSB all season, coming just 104 seconds into the game and marking the second straight game in which DePuy has scored.</p>\n<p>The two sides provided little action until the second half, when DePuy capped off his night recording his third brace of the year. In the 53rd minute, freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong played a simple cross in from the right side towards DePuy, who rose above his defender and headed it down and in towards the far post as he has done so many times this season.</p>\n<p>“We wanted the second goal because this is a dangerous team,” Vom Steeg said. “They score a lot on free kicks, they break out really well, and they haven’t been shutout in a while, so my concern was I didn’t think one goal was going to be enough.”</p>\n<p>UCSB went up 2-0 for the second straight game, but it took just 17 seconds for the Hornets to answer back and cut the lead in half. A cross from the left wing by junior midfielder Ivan Ramirez cut through the Santa Barbara defense before senior forward Isaac Flores put away his fourth goal of the season.</p>\n<p>However, unlike when they tied Cal Poly 2-2 last Saturday, the Gauchos were able to hold on to extend their unbeaten streak to three games.</p>\n<p>“Credit to the team, we did finish this game off a little better than [against Cal Poly],” Vom Steeg said. “We took a couple balls to the corner, we made it a throw in game, we won the head balls in the box that we had to win. All those things that we did not do against Cal Poly, we did tonight.”</p>\n<p>The Big West has seen quite a few goals from the Gauchos this season, who lead the conference with 37 total, but the offensive success can be attributed mostly to DePuy, who ranks first in the nation with 15 goals and eight game-winners.</p>\n<p>“The one thing we discussed at the beginning of the season was if he wanted to pick up 15, 16 goals, he would have to work really hard in the offseason on attacking the ball and either putting it back across the box or getting it down,” Vom Steeg said. “He put the work in to be where he is right now. It’s very hard to stop him when he gets the kind of service he got today.”</p>\n<p>Picking up an assist on both of UCSB’s goals, Acheampong now has 10 for the year, three more than anyone else in the conference.</p>\n<p>“Today I think it all kind of came together,” Acheampong said. “The big guys have been open all year. It just comes down to how efficiently I can get it done and how well I’m able to find them.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos lost junior winger Ismaila Jome to injury in the first half and he did not return. Jome recently returned to the lineup after missing nearly half the season with an ankle injury.</p>\n<p>With Cal Poly drawing 0-0 against UC Davis last night, both the UCSB men’s and women’s soccer teams clinched a spot in the Big West Tournament for the first time since 2009.

Eric Swenson/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>For the first time in four years, the No. 17 UCSB men’s soccer team will be playing for the Big West Tournament Championship. After being deadlocked with UC Davis through 78 minutes in the semifinal match on Wednesday, sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani unleashed a perfectly placed near-post strike from just outside the box to spring the Gauchos to a 1-0 victory.</p>\n<p>“Tonight was a tough game. Anytime you play a team that if they lose their season’s over, you’re going to get everything they have,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We played well tonight. We moved the ball around well, we had our best game in terms of possession, our backs did well in trying to control the game, and we took what they gave us.”</p>\n<p>With the win, Santa Barbara ends a streak of four consecutive postseason losses dating back to 2011 and improves to a record of 13-5-2 overall and 8-2-1 against Big West opponents.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After going winless in their final five regular season games, the Aggies defeated CSUN 2-1 in the quarterfinals to advance and have a chance to avenge two losses to the Gauchos in the previous three weeks. However, UCSB completed a perfect 3-0 sweep of Davis in 2015, dropping the Aggies to 8-10-3 overall, 3-5-3 conference.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will now host Cal State Fullerton in the Big West Tournament finals this Saturday. The Titans overcame an early 1-0 deficit against Cal Poly last night to take a 3-1 win at home, thanks to a second half brace by sophomore midfielder Diego Sanchez.</p>\n<p>Fullerton enters the championship game this Saturday as the No. 1 seed in the Big West South, boasting a record of 12-7-1 overall, 7-3-1 conference.</p>\n<p>After having 11 days off since their last regular season game, the Gauchos came out rested and healthy on Wednesday night. The game marked the third consecutive year that UCSB has entered the semifinals with home-field advantage and the No. 1 seed, but in the past the Gauchos have not been able to get the job done despite playing at home, going 0-3 in the postseason since 2013.</p>\n<p>That all changed last night thanks to a timely one-two between Selemani and sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht, who was placed in a more attacking role than he has been for most of the season. After receiving the ball back on the give and go, Selemani fired a shocking shot in from 25 yards out to give UCSB its only goal against Davis all season that didn’t come from the penalty spot.</p>\n<p>“It feels good to finally bring a playoff win at home,” senior defender Duncan Backus said. “We’ve had so many letdowns in front of our fans, but to finally get into that Big West final it’s a new experience for all of us and it’s a really good opportunity to make some noise and get into the NCAA Tournament.”</p>\n<p>It was the fourth goal for Selemani all season, justifying his All-Big West Second Team selection in his first year with UCSB.</p>\n<p>“My goal was basically to get as many chances as I could,” Selemani said. “I was fortunate enough to get a ball from Kevin in the second half. It’s a strength of mine to put the ball on my left foot and I was lucky enough to get it past the keeper.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara gained control of the game about 15 minutes in. Dominating possession for the rest of the first half and finding several good scoring chances. Junior Ismaila Jome, who has missed significant time this season with an ankle injury, was dangerous nearly every time he touched the ball, torching defenders and sending balls in from the left wing. However, Davis was able to keep the game scoreless all the way until the break.</p>\n<p>“I had the luxury tonight of this being the first time that I can remember going into the Big West Tournament with a full complement of players,” Vom Steeg said. “[Davis] got tired, we were able to press them a little bit, we needed one good shot and Ahinga got that for us tonight.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies picked up the pressure in the second half, attacking UCSB hard on the counter. They found their best chance to score in the 54th minute, when a header by freshman forward Kristian Heptner forced freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg to make an outstanding one-handed, diving save just inside the post.</p>\n<p>It was a relatively quiet night for Vom Steeg, but his two saves in the game helped give UCSB its second consecutive 1-0 victory, both of which came against Davis.</p>\n<p>“I thought it was a great game. It was entertaining,” Davis Head Coach Dwayne Shaffer said. “I give all the credit to Santa Barbara, that’s probably the best team I’ve seen in Santa Barbara in five years. I was impressed.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will now shift its focus to Saturday’s game, when it will play a Fullerton team that it took two overtimes to defeat at home just over a month ago.</p>\n<p>The Big West Tournament Championship will be played Saturday night at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of November 12, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66391\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66391\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/","id":1463,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1462,1461,1460],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
