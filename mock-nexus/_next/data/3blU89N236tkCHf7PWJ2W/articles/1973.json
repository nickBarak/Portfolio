The two have deflected title talk and motivated their less-expensive squads better than any of the coaches at the so-called “big clubs,” including Jose Mourinho, who was fired midseason, and Louis Van Gaal and Arsene Wenger, who are also fighting to keep their jobs before the season comes to a close.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The biggest difference between the two teams at the top and those chasing them isn’t how deep their pockets are, but how incredibly strategic both Leicester and Tottenham have been with spending their money.</p>\n<p>With Pochettino at the helm, the Spurs boasts a roster peppered with homegrown talent such as Ryan Mason and the league’s current goals leader (21) in Harry Kane. While the club has benefited from its choice in local talent, the manager’s best bit of business has resulted through the transfer market, specifically the addition of young attacking midfielder Deli Alli for just over 6 million pounds last winter.</p>\n<p>Via ESPNFC, The English international has scored seven goals and tallied nine assists in his first year as a starter, and has looked like one of the best bargains in recent history this season. With a core of Kane, Alli and Christian Eriksen, the north London team looks like one that could surpass bitter rival Arsenal while becoming a perennial contender.</p>\n<p>While Tottenham ignited its rise in talent through the promotion of youthful players and diligent work in the transfer market, their calculated approach is incomparable to the wonder-deals pulled off to build the Leicester squad that finds itself only seven games away from the club’s first ever title.</p>\n<p>The Foxes’ starting lineup cost a mere 32.5 million euros, 20 million of which was spent on breakout starts N’Golo Kante and Shinji Okazaki alone.</p>\n<p>To put that in perspective, Manchester City paid 75 million for Kevin DeBruyne and 62 million for Raheem Sterling in the offseason. Although they have performed well since moving to Manchester, the Citizens, who were widely considered the favorites to win the Prem, sit in fourth place by a margin of fifteen points behind the leaders.</p>\n<p>Yet, Leicester’s most noteworthy pick up was the signing of Riyad Mahrez from AC Le Havre, a second division French team, for a mere 500 thousand euros. Mahrez has absolutely lit up the league, leading his side’s attack week after week, finding the net 16 times and setting up his teammates another 19, ranking best in the EPL.</p>\n<p>The Algeria international is the frontrunner for the Player of the Year award in his debut season and will surely attract monumental offers from football giants across Europe, and even if he does move on at the end of the season, Leicester’s maestro has been one of the greatest signings in Premier League history.</p>\n<p>Still, the most prevalent issue that remains for both the Spurs and Foxes will be finding a way to contain their key players by helping them to fend off the temptations of the riches that will be offered by teams such as United, Chelsea, City and whoever else.</p>\n<p>But, the championship potential of this season must remain at the forefront for both clubs as they have refreshed the EPL with a process of team building that does not revolve around the spending of hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the richer clubs will take note that it’s not always about buying the most expensive players, but rather the players that fit together and work as a unit to get results.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>All statistics credit to transfermarkt.com and ESPNFC.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69085\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-24/premier-league-title-race-proves-money-cant-buy-titles/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69085\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-24/premier-league-title-race-proves-money-cant-buy-titles/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-24/premier-league-title-race-proves-money-cant-buy-titles/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-24/premier-league-title-race-proves-money-cant-buy-titles/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-24/premier-league-title-race-proves-money-cant-buy-titles/","id":1972,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1971,1970,1969],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"King James: Cleveland’s Savior or Fallen Hope?","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-03-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/lebron-01.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/lebron-01.png?resize=980%2C558&ssl=1","description":"The No. 1 overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft, LeBron James has been crowned as the king of the league despite entering with his high school status.

Becoming the first player since Bill Russell in 1966 to achieve five consecutive trips to the NBA Finals, surely it’s safe to say that James’ dominance in the postseason is no fluke.</p>\n<p>Currently in his 13th season, James has managed to get past the first round in each of his playoff appearances. Although early exits are not a usual situation for James, lingering and arguably haunting his career is his 2-4 NBA Finals record.</p>\n<p>The four series losses tie the amount of NBA Finals losses by Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and Larry Bird combined.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Despite his five consecutive visits to the NBA Finals, James has lost back-to-back championship series as well. While with Miami, James and the Heat were nearly swept by the San Antonio Spurs losing the series 4-1 in the 2014 NBA Finals. After gaining a 2-1 lead, LeBron and the Cavaliers endured a 4-2 series loss to the Golden State Warriors in the 2015 NBA Finals.</p>\n<p>Unable to three-peat as a championship winner, a sixth consecutive NBA Finals appearance this season could warrant an undesired three-peat of three consecutive title losses for King James. Simply put, James cannot afford another championship series loss.</p>\n<p>Commonly critiqued for abandoning the Cleveland Cavaliers and “buying” his back-to-back championship rings by teaming up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh while with the Miami Heat, James’ career and legacy remains incomplete without a ring in his native state of Ohio.</p>\n<p>A three-peat with Miami would have elevated James’ stature in comparison to the success of NBA legends Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, who have both achieved the feat in each of their careers (Jordan twice). The absence of the Larry O’brien trophy in the city of Cleveland can certainly be attributed to LBJ’s return to Cleveland last season.</p>\n<p>After last season’s NBA Finals loss, the time is now or never for the sake of James’ legacy as one of the greatest to play the game to win a much-needed third championship ring.</p>\n<p>With the Cavaliers currently in first-place of the Eastern Conference with a 52-22 record and eight games remaining on the their regular season schedule, the routine ‘Zero Dark Thirty’ mode that James enters each postseason — disengaging from all forms of social media — may need a sooner start than the beginning of the NBA Playoffs on April 16.</p>\n<p>Aside from the hysteria surrounding James’ subliminal social media statements, skepticism regarding his relationship with teammates and other distractive storylines that continue to surmount, the Cleveland Cavaliers currently don’t look like a team capable of winning the NBA Finals.</p>\n<p>Possessing a 6-4 record in their last 10 games, hindering the Cavs’ case in the lasting stretch of the season, has been recent losses to subpar teams such as the Brooklyn Nets, Houston Rockets and Utah Jazz, along with a blowout loss to the playoff contending Miami Heat nearly two weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Although Cleveland’s latest antics haven’t been convincing of it winning the NBA Finals, there remains no doubt that the team from ‘The Land’ will represent the Eastern Conference come this June.</p>\n<p>Sure, the Toronto Raptors, who are on pace to set a new franchise wins record in addition to being just 2.0 games behind the Cavs for first place while holding a 2-1 tiebreaker advantage, along with the Atlanta Hawks, Boston Celtics or Miami Heat each have a chance to meet Cleveland in the conference finals, but can any of these teams truly compete and win a seven-game series against the Cavaliers?</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, fueling the Cavaliers journey to the NBA Finals are last postseason’s losses of Kevin Love in the first round of the playoffs vs the Celtics and Kyrie Irving in overtime of Game 1 of the NBA Finals.</p>\n<p>Prior to Cleveland’s return to the playoffs since James’ departure in 2010, neither Love nor Irving had a postseason appearance.</p>\n<p>While Love’s presence in the Finals would have only enhanced the Cavaliers’ matchup against the Warriors, the loss of Irving was most devastating to their chances of winning.</p>\n<p>The team’s leading three-point shooter at 41.5 percent and second in scoring at 21.7 points per game last season, the dependence of Irving as another ‘go-to’ player was lost as he fractured his left knee cap in overtime of Game 1 of the Finals.</p>\n<p>While it is nearly impossible to refute the Warriors’ championship victory, Irving’s presence could have reduced the Cavs’ overdependence  on James. A definite top-five point guard in the NBA, the now three-time All-Star had 23 points, seven rebounds, six assists, four steals and two blocks in the series opening game along with the game saving block to help send it into overtime.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qit15vtspoM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Still, there is some cause for concern as the Cavaliers have struggled against top-tier opponents this season. Moreover, Cleveland is 19-15 versus teams with a record of .500 and above, while it is 33-7 against teams below .500.</p>\n<p>After firing David Blatt in his second year with the team despite the Cavs’ 30-11 start this season, now under the helm of first year Head Coach Tyronn Lue, Cleveland is 22-11 since Lue’s hiring on Jan. 22.</p>\n<p>With the postseason approaching, one must wonder if Lue, in his first year as Head Coach and will enter the playoffs with 41 games coached at the end of the regular season, is capable of helping pave the way for the Cavaliers to win it all? Not to mention, is the team really HIS team? Throughout a majority of the Cavs’ 106-100 loss to Houston Tuesday night, James was seen on the court, sideline, and even in the team’s huddle during timeouts making commands as if Lue wasn’t there.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6AOQ9fyErr4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Blamed for the firing of Blatt, it’d be wise for James to accept his role as a player with regard to helping his coach receive as little scrutiny as possible as there hasn’t been much of a difference in the team since Lue’s takeover which only leaves eyebrows raised at if the Cavaliers bothered a situation that didn’t need tuning.</p>\n<p>But Lue has somewhat borrowed a page from Spurs’ Head Coach Gregg Popovich’s book by resting players like James, Love and Irving as the postseason approaches in hopes of preserving their health. The decision can only be beneficial for the players, especially James after missing a career-high 13 games last season in addition to having played nearly 40,000 career minutes.</p>\n<p>Yet, in attempt to add some playoff experience to its roster, Cleveland’s additions of veterans such as Richard Jefferson during the offseason, Channing Frye in free agency and the return of Mo Williams show the Cavs’ effort to close in on its first NBA title in franchise history.</p>\n<p>Whether Cleveland faces Golden State or San Antonio in the NBA Finals, James seems to be aware of the foreshadowing pressure surrounding his legacy and the urgency to win another ring. Nonetheless, adding to this pressure is the continuous championship drought that has burdened the city of Cleveland since 1964, in which the Cleveland Browns won a championship in the pre- Super Bowl era.</p>\n<p>With players like Steph Curry and Kawhi Leonard earning the nod in the conversation of being the NBA’s best player, there’s no doubt that a chip is sitting on King James’ shoulder to remind the world that the 4-time NBA MVP is still around.</p>\n<p>Yet, it is both of these players and their respective teams that have stifled James in the past.

Others may choose to take advantage of that extra year to work on their skills so that they may gain more playing time in their sport for the upcoming season.</p>\n<p>Yet neither of these reasons apply to senior center Lauren Martin of the UCSB women’s water polo team.</p>\n<p>The Clovis West High School graduate joined the Gaucho family after a very successful high school career in which she earned seven varsity letters both in water polo as well as swimming. She is a two-time All-American, collecting First Team honors as a senior and Fourth Team accolades as a junior.</p>\n<p>Martin was also an All-CIF Central Section selection twice and earned All-Tri River Athletic Conference distinction two times as well. Martin led her team to three consecutive Tri River Athletic Conference titles and individually won consecutive CIF championships in 2008 and 2009.</p>\n<p>It was no surprise that after all of those merits, the freshman went on to play in all 35 games in her first season, generating 29 goals and 13 assists and finishing the season with an impressive shooting percentage of .392. Martin also led the team in earned penalties and ejections with a high count of 47 that year. The two following years were as productive as the first, contributing 24 and 33 goals her sophomore and junior season, respectively.</p>\n<p>Playing time was not a problem for Lauren who had certainly earned her spot as the team’s center player; however, coming into her fourth season she decided to take a year off.</p>\n<p>“The reason why I redshirted last year is because I had certain goals for myself and I felt that I would meet those goals if I took off a year and just trained,” Martin said. “We had a new coach and I wanted to try and figure out her coaching style and also because our team was very young.”</p>\n<p>Train she did, and it certainly paid off. Although players continue to assist practice and play against their own teammates, not participating in games against outside competitors can deteriorate some athletes’ skills.</p>\n<p>Yet, this was not the case when it came to Martin.</p>\n<p>Right from the start of this season, her presence made such a significant impact on the team. In her first game back against Cal, she put away four goals alone, proving that she had been waiting to be back in the pool with her teammates for a very long time and seemed determined to make the most of her senior campaign.</p>\n<p>“She’s been sitting for over a year waiting to play,” Head Coach Serela Kay mentioned in an interview earlier this year. “She’s excited, and we’re excited to have her back in the paint to fill that role and she’s doing great.”</p>\n<p>Even after her outstanding performance that weekend, it remained unpredictable just how “great” she would continue to do throughout the season and how much of an influence she would have on the team.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t really have the mindset of ‘Oh I hope I do well,’” Marin said. “It was just what was expected, out of the whole entire team, even, not just myself.”</p>\n<p>The 5’10” center finished her last season with UCSB as the team’s leading scorer with 45 goals and a striking shooting percentage of .517, feats that helped her to earn Big West Player of the Week honors twice this season.</p>\n<p>However, the importance of her contributions to the team were not only in the amount of goals that she would put away each game, but also in their timing.</p>\n<p>On several occasions, Martin came in clutch when the team needed her the most. She had a couple of game-winners, some occurring in overtime, which would give the Gauchos the victory in addition to being a catalyst that occasionally sparked the team when it needed to recoup in dire situations.</p>\n<p>“Whenever I go in the game, it is my job to get a goal or set a teammate up with a really nice pass or earn an ejection so that someone else can score,” Martin said modestly. “My mindset going is to give 110 percent every time I go in the water.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the senior might attribute some of her collegiate success both in and out of the pool to her earlier years when she participated in the Olympic Development Program.</p>\n<p>The program’s purpose is develop players that will represent USA Water Polo throughout domestic and international competition. With such high expectations and the effort that is required of all athletes, the experience was beneficial beyond the depths of the pool, helping individuals improve as everyday people.</p>\n<p>“It showed me commitment, and just going into those practices knowing that you have eight hours of practice ahead, but knowing that it will all pay off in the long run teaches you determination,” Martin said. “It also helped with time management, knowing that I had a long practice ahead and I had to plan for school and other stuff I had to do.”</p>\n<p>While her career at UCSB might be over after the Big West Tournament, Martin hopes to continue doing what she loves in the future. While nothing is set in stone yet, word has it that this powerful player will be taking her talents overseas.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 28, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70437\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-risky-plunge-rewarded/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70437\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-risky-plunge-rewarded/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-risky-plunge-rewarded/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-risky-plunge-rewarded/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-risky-plunge-rewarded/","id":1970,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[1969,1968,1967],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
