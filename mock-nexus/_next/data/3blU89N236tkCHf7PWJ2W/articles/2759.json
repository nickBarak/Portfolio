Senate Joint Committee on University Affairs and Constitution and By-Laws meets to discuss bills. <em>Hari Patel/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate Joint Committee on University Affairs and Constitution and By-Laws (CBL) met for the last time this quarter on Tuesday in the UCen’s Goleta Valley Room to discuss five Senate bills.</p>\n<p>The joint committee voted to move three of the five bills to the consent calendar, designating them to eventually come to a vote in Senate. The other two bills moved to old business will not appear on the Senate floor until next school year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.as.ucsb.edu/senate/bills/051315-135-a-bill-to-facilitate-efficiency-in-appointing-senate-committee-chairs-and-vice-chairs/\">A Bill to Facilitate Efficiency in Appointing Senate Committee Chairs and Vice Chairs</a>, written by on-campus senator and second-year English major Matthew Santos, states the A.S. Internal Vice President, who acts as President of the Senate, should appoint Senators as Chairs and Vice Chairs of Senate Standing Committees.</p>\n<p>The bill changes the current protocol which allows committees to elect chairs and vice chairs.</p>\n<p>The joint committee voted unanimously to move the bill to the consent calendar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.as.ucsb.edu/senate/bills/051315-136-a-bill-to-institutionalize-the-as-innovation-fund/\">A Bill to Institutionalize the A.S. Innovation Fund</a>, written by off-campus senator and second-year history of public policy major Cassie Mancini, builds on A.S.’s Resolution to Grow and Promote the A.S. Innovation Fund, which gathers donations to fund student initiatives. If passed, the bill will establish protocol for the disbursement of donated funds.</p>\n<p>If the bill passes, A.S. Director of Alumni Affairs and A.S. Chief Financial Officer will assist in the stewardship of the A.S. Innovation Fund, and future expenditures from the fund will be recommended by the A.S. President in consultation with the Donor Oversight Committee, then approved by a two-thirds vote in Senate. The bill also establishes protocol for A.S. members to donate portions of honoraria gained through A.S. positions.</p>\n<p>The joint committee voted unanimously to move the bill to the consent calendar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.as.ucsb.edu/senate/bills/051315-138-a-bill-to-establish-mandatory-training-on-understanding-unconscious-bias-and-the-roots-of-anti-semitism-for-associated-students-senators-and-executives/\">A Bill to Establish Mandatory Training on Understanding Unconscious Bias and the Roots of Anti-Semitism for Associated Students Senators and Executives</a>, written by off-campus senator and third-year political science and psychology double major Michelle Moreh, would require the A.S. Internal Vice President to coordinate a training for all A.S. senators with the Anti-Defamation League by the sixth week of fall quarter.</p>\n<p>The bill builds on the A.S. Resolution to Condemn Anti-Semitism.</p>\n<p>The joint committee voted unanimously to move the bill to the consent calendar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.as.ucsb.edu/senate/bills/051315-145-a-bill-to-update-article-iv-section-1/\">A Bill to Update Article IV Section 1</a>, written by off-campus senator and second-year communications and political science double major Hiro Bower, offers new protocol for when campus organizations funded by lock-in fees end the fiscal year with money left over.</p>\n<p>If the bill passes, funding not rolled over to campus organizations accounts for the next fiscal year will move to the A.S. Finance and Business Committee, and distributed to any Office of Student Life (OSL) or A.S. entity “requesting funds for a project or program relevant to the specified language of the lock in.”</p>\n<p>The bill also establishes exceptions to this code, allowing Educational Opportunity Program, KCSB, A.S. Program Board, Communications Personnel, A.S. Recycling, I.V. Improvements, I.V. Tenants Union, the Coastal Fund and the Community Affairs Board automatic rollovers of funds not spent by the end of a fiscal year.</p>\n<p>College of Creative Studies (CCS) Collegiate Senator and second-year CCS physics major Liam Stanton said he was “not a yes” on the bill because he thought unused funds should remain at the discretion of Senate to supplement the A.S. budget.</p>\n<p>“If you don’t appropriate it to OSL from the accounts and just leave it in the general fund, it can be used for whatever and whoever,” Stanton said. “We have to trim money every year off the budget, and if we didn’t allow so many rollovers and we allowed it to roll over into the discretionary funds, I guess we wouldn’t have to trim because the scale at which we trim is way less than the amount of money that is rolled over each year.”</p>\n<p>But College of Letters and Science collegiate senator and fourth-year economics major Nikka Kurland said the bill could ensure students “get what they paid for” with lock-in fees.</p>\n<p>“We’re not like any other business where you need to save money,” Kurland said. “It’s encouraged that a lock-in spends all the money they have within that year, because those students paid for those things for that one year.”</p>\n<p>The joint committee voted to move the bill to old business.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.as.ucsb.edu/senate/bills/051315-134-a-bill-to-re-envision-the-senate-standing-committees/\">A Bill to Re-envision the Senate Standing Committees</a>, also written by Mancini, would combine the Senate University Affairs Committee and Senate Constitution and By-Laws Committees to form the Campus Affairs Committee.</p>\n<p>Mancini said the bill should pass to create a larger committee, which could ensure quorum more often and foster discussion on the A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p>“I feel like the fact that we are still having joint University Affairs and CBL meetings is indicative of why the bill should pass,” Mancini said. “You do need to have a large group of people to have good discussion on things.”</p>\n<p>The joint committee voted to move the bill to old business.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Staff Assistance Program (ASAP) Senior Consultant and Psychologist Beth Cohen will hold a discussion on psychological healing titled “The Impact of the Isla Vista Tragedy: One Year Later” Wednesday and Thursday at noon in the University Center in preparation for the upcoming anniversary of the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>In these discussions, Cohen will explore the lasting impacts of trauma on the I.V. and UCSB communities and different types of healing processes individuals may experience.</p>\n<p>According to Cohen, the discussion will focus on the community-wide and individual reactions to traumatic events.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to do a lot of education about post-traumatic stress disorder, about how trauma can affect people and they don’t even know it, some of the research around trauma and then ways of healing,” Cohen said.</p>\n<p>Cohen said she encourages I.V. and UCSB community members to recognize the long-lasting effects of trauma.</p>\n<p>“To give you an idea, there are a number of cases right now that I am working where actual people, faculty and staff specifically, are having trouble working and didn’t know why,” Cohen said. “Truth was that they were traumatized and they didn’t know it. The important thing is that education around trauma is vital … trauma is very treatable.”</p>\n<p>Cohen aims to help those affected by the events of May 23 last year understand their emotions are normal, ASAP Coordinator John Berberet said.</p>\n<p>“It’s our way of helping people come to terms with it or help people find some meaning and moving on, not in the spirit of forgetting or disregarding, but to find some meaning and understanding,” Cohen said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The important thing is that education around trauma is vital … trauma is very treatable. – Psychologist Beth Cohen</p></blockquote>\n<p>Berberet said one goal of the discussion is to help the individuals understand repressed emotions that may surface during the week of May 23.</p>\n<p>“People that experience and examine trauma in the past in another part of their life — some of that stuff can get stirred up again when another traumatic event happens,” Berberet said.</p>\n<p>Berberet said he anticipates that the first anniversary of the events of May 23 last year will be difficult for I.V. and UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Especially with the first anniversary, there’s something about our human nature we sort of reassess and reexamine what is going on in our lives that we to have memorialize to help us heal,” Berberet said.</p>\n<p>Berberet said I.V. residents and UCSB students, staff and faculty have found unique ways of healing since May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“Wonderful people are finding … ways of dealing or finding memorials or rituals that are moving forward for the community,” Berberet said.</p>\n<p><em>ASAP encourages faculty and staff to attend one of the two sessions and also welcomes students to the discussion, in addition to the services Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) will continue to offer throughout the week.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

climb all fourteen 8,000 meter mountain peaks without the use of supplementary oxygen, spoke at Campbell Hall Tuesday night about her 8,611 meter trek up K2, the second highest mountain in the world.</p>\n<p>A skiing, ice climbing and mountaineering enthusiast from the age of 13, Kaltenbrunner used her money working as an oncology nurse to fund her climbing expeditions until climbing the Nanga Parbat in 2003 and finally deciding to mountain climb professionally. As the last leg of Arts &amp; Lecture’s “National Geographic Live” series, Kaltenbrunner’s lecture was accompanied by photography and video to supplement her narrative recounting of trekking up her last 8,000 meter mountain peak: K2.</p>\n<p>Prior to reaching K2’s summit in 2011, Kaltenbrunner had attempted to climb the mountain’s peak six previous times.</p>\n<p>“Six times I had to turn back just before reaching the highest point. Despite those six returns, K2 still resided in my heart,” Kaltenbrunner said.</p>\n<p>For her seventh attempt up the world’s second largest mountain, Kaltenbrunner decided she would bypass the conventional route up the south side of the mountain from Pakistan via the Cesen Route, and would instead go up the North Pillar from China.</p>\n<p>“I had decided for the very unconventional way,” Kaltenbrunner said. “I chose a very difficult route on K2— the North Pillar, a very, very beautiful plane up to the highest point. This is a very challenging way up.”</p>\n<p>During her lecture, Kaltenbrunner detailed the process by which her team — comprised of herself and four men — travelled to the base of K2 from China by crossing the hazardous Shanksgam River on camelback, then proceeded to spend 80 days setting up base, acclimating their bodies to the extremely high altitudes and climbing up the icy, windy, subzero mountainside.</p>\n<p>“[At times] it was far too cold. We couldn’t feel our fingers anymore … It was so difficult for us to stay whole nights in the tiny tent. It was hard to go out,” Kaltenbrunner said. “But when I did go out it was just amazing. We had such beautiful nights, very clear nights full of stars. As you can imagine, up there, there is no light pollution. Many times I could see, from the light of the stars, the shadow from my own body. It’s amazing up there.”</p>\n<p>Kaltenbrunner said what she had felt after reaching K2’s peak and fulfilling one of her life-long dreams was indescribable.</p>\n<p>“In order to successfully reach your goals, and it doesn’t matter which goals they are, you have to be enthusiastic,” Kaltenbrunner said. “Prepare yourself mentally for unforeseeable situations. Maintain calm and serenity in situations that seem to be hopeless … Never give up. Hope that everything will work out in the end. And most importantly, respect nature and follow your own path.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Cody Sturges said the most striking thing about Kaltenbrunner’s lecture were the images of her on the summit and the accounts of her 80-day climbing expedition.</p>\n<p>“The sheer distance she put toward that goal and then finally accomplishing it, it’s really something special,” Stuges said. “The most important thing is to never give up. She kept pushing; she made it.”</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara native and Ventura resident Joe Norris, Kaltenbrunner’s ability to fight through adversity and approach situations with meticulous preparation are principles that can be applied to everyday goals.</p>\n<p>“Getting a degree or passing a test, setting your goals, being passionate about it — that’s what you can draw from every day experiences,” Norris said. “Just climbing the mountain of life.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Richard Martinez, father of victim Christopher Michaels-Martinez, and Bob Weiss, father of victim Veronika Weiss, both spoke and held a Q&amp;A session at the event to share their experiences since the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>Martinez said, as a member of pro-gun control organization Everytown for Gun Safety, he does not wish to ban guns, but rather to reduce gun-related violence and crime.</p>\n<p>“I grew up with guns … Everytown and me personally, we’re not anti-guns, we’re anti-gun violence,” Martinez said. “I’m not out to ban guns from people who are responsible citizens. I want to make sure as much as possible that dangerous people don’t have guns.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said he wants to ensure criminal background checks are carried out, and improve existing background checks to prevent dangerous individuals from acquiring guns.</p>\n<p>“The most effective thing we can do to end gun violence in this country is to have criminal background checks on all gun sales,” Martinez said. “We have criminal checks on gun sales in California, but we need to do better. We need to keep guns out of the hands of felons, domestic abusers and people who are seriously mentally ill.”</p>\n<p>According to Martinez, states that require criminal background checks before gun purchases see less gun-related crimes.</p>\n<p>“In states that have criminal checks for gun sales, fewer women are killed with guns, fewer law enforcement officers are killed on duty and fewer people commit suicide,” Martinez said. “The I.V. shooter had a long history of serious mental illness. We need to improve our background check system to make sure that the information gets into the background check.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said studies show while 1,171,177 Americans in total have died from the nation’s past wars, an even greater number of Americans have died due to gunfire, with 1,384,171 recorded between the years 1968 and 2012.</p>\n<p>“PBS commentator Mark Shields made the following statement, ‘More Americans have been killed by gunfire since 1968 than in all the wars in the nation’s history,’ and he made the statement on December 2012,” Martinez said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63567\" style=\"width: 351px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63567\" data-attachment-id=\"63567\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-19/fathers-speak-on-gun-safety-control/richard-martinez-shares-his-story-about-how-gun-violence-has-affected-his-life/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Richard Martinez shares his story about how gun violence has affected his life\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1431915085\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0333333333333\",\"title\":\"Richard Martinez shares his story about how gun violence has affected his life\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Richard Martinez shares his story about how gun violence has affected his life\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-63567\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?resize=341%2C227\" alt=\"Richard Martinez shares his story about how gun violence has affected his life.

How has that become acceptable?”</p>\n<p>Weiss said he will attend the UC Board of Regents meeting on May 20 at UC San Francisco to advocate for UC divestment from businesses that produce guns.</p>\n<p>“On Thursday I will be at the Board of Regents meeting at UCSF presenting petitions from students about divestiture,” Weiss said. “University of California is invested in weapons manufacturing. They’re actually taking your money and investing it in companies that make guns. And when I heard about that, I had to get involved.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said since the events of May 23 last year, he has helped pass “red flag legislation” which allows individuals to report cases if they feel threatened by someone near to them and potentially confiscate guns and other weapons from suspects if a judge agrees there may be danger.</p>\n<p>“Red Flag Legislation allows immediate family members or law enforcement, if they believe that a loved one is a danger to themselves or others, they can go take that evidence before a judge and if the judge agrees, the judge can order that the person return any weapons they have and prohibit that person from buying more weapons,” Martinez said.</p>\n<p>Martinez said he hopes to add a checklist in police reports to be completed by officers and deputies in the case of domestic violence or mental stability investigations, and to ensure officials inform those involved of the Red Flag Legislation.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If we took the second amendment literally, it’s the right to keep and bear arms, each one of us would have the right to keep a tank in our backyard and nobody understands it in that way. – Richard Martinez</p></blockquote>\n<p>“The domestic violence addendum to police reports is a checklist for officers to make sure they did everything in a domestic violence situation,” Martinez said. “I’ve talked to Sheriff Brown about doing a checklist about somebody’s mental stability, and one thing I’d like to have on the checklist is the red flag legislation.”</p>\n<p>Weiss said Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department (SBCSD) should have performed a more thorough welfare check on the shooter on April 30, questioning whether he was in possession of guns.</p>\n<p>“There’s a question in a threat assessment that should be on [Richard Martinez’s] checklist, and according to the FBI they are preventing mass shootings right now by always asking this question,” Weiss said. “This wasn’t asked of the Isla Vista monster; no one asked him if he had a gun. One thing police officers are trained in is having a sense of when someone’s lying to them.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said some gun lobbyists believe a higher power and the second amendment under the Constitution, the right to keep and bear arms, warrant their desire to have a gun anywhere at any time.</p>\n<p>“They feel the second amendment guarantees them the absolute right to carry a gun at any time and any place,” Martinez said. “Some say we have a God-given right. Although I’m not a biblical scholar but … I’m puzzled by that one.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said the second amendment and other rights under the Constitution are not absolute, and there are certain exceptions to the right of possessing weapons.</p>\n<p>“You don’t have absolute right of free speech, you can’t go onto a crowded movie theater and yell ‘fire,’ you can’t threaten to kill somebody,” Martinez said. “You don’t have the absolute right to practice religion — you can’t engage in human sacrifice. If we took the second amendment literally, it’s the right to keep and bear arms, each one of us would have the right to keep a tank in our backyard and nobody understands it in that way.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63568\" style=\"width: 351px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63568\" data-attachment-id=\"63568\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-19/fathers-speak-on-gun-safety-control/bob-weiss-talks-about-his-professional-relationship-with-richard-martinez/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Bob Weiss talks about his professional relationship with Richard Martinez\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1431916025\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"128\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"Bob Weiss talks about his professional relationship with Richard Martinez\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bob Weiss talks about his professional relationship with Richard Martinez\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-63568\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?resize=341%2C227\" alt=\"Bob Weiss talks about his professional relationship with Richard Martinez.

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Weiss said he disagrees with gun lobbyists, and the second amendment is not necessarily applicable in modern-day as it was written at a time when newly independent American civilians required a way to defend themselves against the English.</p>\n<p>“The gun lobbyist’s arguments are all bullshit,” Weiss said. “The second amendment — it was written to protect us from the British who were apt to invade our shores anytime because we didn’t have a proper army to take them on. It didn’t have anything to do with protecting yourself from robbers.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said another stance taken by gun lobbyists is to solve gun violence by increasing the number of guns, which according to Martinez is an outdated resolution.</p>\n<p>“The second argument that you hear is that the solution to gun violence in our country is more guns,” Martinez said. “That suggestion is a 1800’s solution to a 21st century problem. We can do better. What the heck are you supposed to do with a gun during Deltopia? It just doesn’t make sense.”</p>\n<p>Weiss said while I.V. is seen as an “idyllic place,” there are several problems, including high crime, in the college town that must be addressed.</p>\n<p>“It’s a beautiful place … everyone’s pretending, ‘Oh, it’s by the ocean and the sun shines and everybody’s happy,’” Weiss said. “Deltopia draws in thousands of high school and college kids. You can’t do that in most cities; you would get shut down a long time ago. This town is a big damn mess, it needs to be cleaned up.”</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major Adriana Marquez-Gallegos attended the talk and said she is in favor of gun safety laws and hopes to look into more legislations against gun violence.</p>\n<p>“I thought it was really informative and it opened up my eyes to gun violence,” Marquez-Gallegos said. “It could have been any one of my friends or myself, and you just never know. I think I would look into gun laws we can pass and more voting.”</p>\n<p>Second-year biology major Scotty O’Brien said he is concerned more gun safety laws will remove the weapons from the possession of responsible entities and contribute to a black market for guns to be accessed by dangerous individuals.</p>\n<p>“While I believe that so-called common sense safety laws can make us less safe, I do recognize that the increased prevalence of firearms in the community results in more shootings,” O’Brien said. “More safety laws mean less people are able to purchase firearms through the legal market. The black market for guns is just like with drugs, just expands and expands and turns into a whole messy organized crime situation.”</p>\n<p>O’Brien said, while decreasing the amount of guns could decrease gun-related issues, it may not contribute to lower violence overall because other types of weapons are available.</p>\n<p>“More guns, same amount of violence, the violence won’t go away — it’s just a matter of how one chooses to defend or not defend themselves,” O’Brien said.</p>\n<p>Martinez said UCSB students and the youth population in general should take a stance on gun violence and promote safety measures that will inevitably affect them.</p>\n<p>“Don’t ever kid yourself that it can’t happen to you. When the I.V. shooter left his apartment, he went out to kill. He had over 600 rounds left,” Martinez said. “So, you have a choice, you can forget about it and go on and continue to enjoy your lives here and pretend it won’t happen again, or you can do something about it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63580\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-19/fathers-speak-on-gun-safety-control/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63580\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-19/fathers-speak-on-gun-safety-control/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-19/fathers-speak-on-gun-safety-control/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-19/fathers-speak-on-gun-safety-control/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-19/fathers-speak-on-gun-safety-control/","id":2757,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2756,2755,2754],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
