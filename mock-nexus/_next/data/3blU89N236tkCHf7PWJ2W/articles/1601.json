Santa Barbara kicked off conference play with a pair of shutouts, defeating Cal State Fullerton 3-0 Friday and UC Riverside 2-0 Sunday, ending a seven-game homestand.</p>\n<p>UCSB has now won three consecutive games, all shutouts, improving its record to 7-4 overall and 2-0 in conference. With the defense playing outstandingly and the offense finally starting to warm up, the Gauchos are once again looking like a dangerous team in the Big West this season.</p>\n<p>“From the first game at home to this last, that is our third consecutive shutout. Every game for the past five games we’ve been playing better and better,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “I would say that three weeks ago, two weeks ago, we would have lost that game. The fact that we are now finding a way to win was the real takeaway from today’s game.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sunday night’s game featured scoring before the crowd even got comfortable in their seats. Senior forward Achille Campion scored a goal 37 seconds into the game, setting the tone for the Gauchos early on. Campion’s goal was a team-high fourth on the season off a through ball from senior midfielder Goffin Boyoko, while senior defender Daniel Welsh also received an assist on the play.</p>\n<p>After Campion gave UCSB the advantage, the game developed into a physical match as nine yellow cards were issued during the night, with players from both teams not backing down. Play throughout the game was extremely chippy, especially during the second half.</p>\n<p>“To me, it starts and ends that there’s a responsibility for the man with the whistle. The reality is [the referee] let a lot go,” Vom Steeg said. “I thought we were tough enough, strong enough. We didn’t lose our composure, we didn’t freak out. I wasn’t joking when I said I was happy that we won the game, we had no injuries and we didn’t take a red card.”</p>\n<p>Playing with a 1-0 lead, the Gauchos received an insurance goal from freshman forward Ismaila Jome in the 82nd minute to cement the result as a UCSB victory. Jome’s shot from beyond the box was the first goal of his career.</p>\n<p>“I feel like [the offense is] progressing pretty well,” Jome said. “I’m new to the team, [freshman midfielder Drew Murphy] is new to the team and we have a couple more freshmen playing, so we’re just getting used to each other and playing up top with [Campion and Boyoko].”</p>\n<p>Defensively, UCSB was led by freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely who recorded five saves and posted his third consecutive shutout.</p>\n<p>“Our defense has finally found itself. They’re competing for balls, they’re competing for everything and they’re not leaving loose balls,” Vom Steeg said. “Josh is making the one or two plays that he has to make. The bottom line is we always thought our defense was going to be good this year; it just takes us a while. These are two games that we had to have this weekend and nothing’s ever easy.”</p>\n<p>While Sunday’s game certainly displayed the Gauchos’ superiority, UCSB was even more dominant on Friday night against Fullerton.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos received goals from three seniors not usually known for putting the ball in the back of the net in midfielder Fifi Baiden and defenders Peter Schmetz and Matt Glodack. Santa Barbara controlled the game, owning an 18-11 advantage in shots and a 7-4 edge in shots on goal.</p>\n<p>Campion and Jome each recorded an assist on the night, while Murphy added two for the Gauchos. Jome led the team in assists with five on the season.</p>\n<p>“I think we are clicking, we’re getting our team chemistry right now,” Baiden said. “At the beginning of every season, we have a lot of freshman on the team and people get injured, so it’s hard to find that team rhythm. But now everything is great, people are getting back from injury and we’re getting an understanding of how everyone plays.”</p>\n<p>McNeely was solid once again between the posts, making four saves on the night for the Gauchos. Thanks in large part to McNeely, UCSB has recorded shutouts in three consecutive matches for the first time since 2010 and sits atop the Big West North division standings.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely confidence when you don’t get scored on, that feels great because that means we can work going forward,” Campion said. “I think everyone did a good job and I’m proud of my teammates.”</p>\n<p>While defense was certainly a key to the victory, the offense found a groove, scoring three goals, and tied for a season-high with two other occasions in the year.</p>\n<p>“It was very important for our team confidence and what we’re trying to do in terms of winning the Big West tournament or winning a Big West championship,” Baiden said. “It’s good for us, it sets the tone for the next game and we’re going to be fired up for the next game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next travels to Cal State Northridge for a 7 p.m. match on Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 7, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

CSULB was not finished for the half and scored again eight minutes later when junior midfielder Taylor Nelson shot from distance into the corner of the goal to put the 49ers up by two heading into the second half.</p>\n<p>“Momentum is a really hard thing to turn around,” Stumpf said. “We were really chasing the game for the first 20, 30 minutes.”</p>\n<p>With adjustments made coming into the second half, UCSB was nearly able to even the game but was still unable to establish any rhythm offensively. Long Beach’s early momentum was enough to carry them past the Gauchos for a 2-1 win. After a shutout win on Friday, the Gaucho defense was not on par with Friday’s performance.</p>\n<p>“It’s a Sunday game, it’s hot in the afternoon and [the defense] played a lot of minutes on Friday night,” sophomore forward Angelisa Cortez said. “They worked hard, the best they can do … They played to the maximum of their ability.”</p>\n<p>Despite getting behind in the first half against Long Beach, Friday’s match against UC Irvine brought better results for the Gauchos. The two teams were in a defensive stalemate for the first half until UCSB broke through late with a goal in the 44th minute. Junior midfielder Madison Beckley headed in a cross for her team-high fifth goal of the season.</p>\n<p>UCI entered the second half with more inspired play and became aggressors on the offensive side of the pitch. Being limited to only three shots in the first 45 minutes of the game, the Anteaters had 10 shots in the second half. However, the solid Gaucho defense remained on point and kept UCI from getting off a serious threat on goal.</p>\n<p>In the final minutes of the game, the Gauchos began to slow down, causing Irvine to take advantage of the worn-out defensive. UCSB was able to survive the late scare by the Anteaters to hang on to the 1-0 win.</p>\n<p>“I think we only won two conference games all last year and I kind of put Irvine at the top of the pile in the teams in the Big West, so to get a result off them on a Friday night at home is great,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>It was UCSB’s sixth shutout win in its last eight games before losing on Sunday. Sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter continued her stellar play between the nets, coming up huge for five saves to preserve Friday’s shutout.</p>\n<p>UCSB will now travel to Hawaii to face the Warriors on Thursday, followed by another road game against Cal State Northridge on Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 7, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52340\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52340\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches/","id":1600,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1599,1598,1597],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops Decision to No. 19 Denver","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"All of the grit the UCSB women’s soccer team displayed during its first 10 games of the season was on display in its final non-conference game of the season versus the University of Denver.

Up against the 19th ranked team in the country at Harder Stadium, the Gauchos lost 2-1 on a late second-half goal, despite the tenacity they showcased.</p>\n<p>The loss drops UCSB to 6-4-1 overall and marks the second time this season the Gauchos have dropped consecutive games. With the victory, the Pioneers move to 8-1-1 on the year as they remain consistent on the road.</p>\n<p>UCSB made it a priority to control Denver’s main offensive weapon in senior forward Kristen Hamilton and kept her in check throughout much of the match. Hamilton entered the game with seven goals in only nine games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>However, the Pioneers still managed to find a hole in the defense early in the first half. The defense, which has been a strong point of the team for the season, gave up a goal via a corner kick in the 18th minute to make the match 1-0.</p>\n<p>Freshman midfielder Brooke Boothe settled the ball on the pass from senior midfielder Nicholette DiGiacomo and lifted it over the goalkeeper to give the Pioneers the lead going into halftime. Santa Barbara responded with a goal coming out of the half.</p>\n<p>In the 52nd minute, junior midfielder Madison Beckley received the ball from sophomore defender Savannah Francis at the top of the box and shot it past the Pioneer defense and into the left corner of the net to draw the game even at one goal apiece. The goal was Beckley’s fourth goal of the season, giving her the most of the team.</p>\n<p>From there on, the game was an even stalemate with each team struggling to maintain ball possession. However, much as it has done for most of the season, Denver began to wear down its opponent as the game got deeper into the second half. The Pioneers began to increase the pressure and had a series of shots on target against the goalkeeper, getting as close as hitting the crossbar.</p>\n<p>The pressure from Denver proved to be overwhelming for the Gauchos who were called for a foul inside the box in the 76th minute of the game. Junior defender Sam Harder stepped up to the spot and kicked it past sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter to give the Pioneers the 2-1 advantage.</p>\n<p>Denver held the Gauchos in check for the remaining time left on the clock and controlled the pace of the game after scoring the go-ahead goal, ultimately defeating the Gauchos 2-1.</p>\n<p>Denver benefitted from being the aggressors on the pitch as they outshot the Gauchos 15-8. However, most of the damage done by the Pioneers came in the second half, as they had an impressive 12 shots and limited Santa Barbara to only one shot in the period. The sluggish second-half play of the Gauchos was in direct contrast to its play in the first half, where they had seven shots on goal.</p>\n<p>The next game of the season will begin the start of conference play for the Gauchos as they host UC Irvine at Harder Stadium. The Anteaters enter the game with a record of 5-4 overall. Kick-off for Friday’s game against the Anteaters is scheduled to start at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of September 30, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52227\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-drops-decision-to-no-19-denver/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52227\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-drops-decision-to-no-19-denver/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-drops-decision-to-no-19-denver/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-drops-decision-to-no-19-denver/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-drops-decision-to-no-19-denver/","id":1598,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1597,1596,1595],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Split Pair of Weekend Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/M_Soccer_Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/M_Soccer_Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Playing its first two games at home since the beginning of classes, the UCSB men’s soccer team split a pair of matches over the weekend.

The Gauchos dropped a 2-1 heartbreaker to Stanford in overtime on Friday before rebounding with a 1-0 victory over Loyola Marymount on Sunday night to improve to 5-4 this year.</p>\n<p>“[The victory] was much needed, especially the way we got it, because there were some heartbreaks the last two games,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “I think it was important for us morale wise and psyche wise. Obviously we’re very encouraged by today’s result.”</p>\n<p>Sunday night’s victory over LMU (4-2-1) featured an aggressive Gauchos’ offensive attack that outshot the Lions 17-11 with a 9-4 advantage in shots on goal.

Sophomore defender Marshall Cazares and freshman forward Ismaila Jome each received assists on the play, Jome’s team leading fourth this season.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Achille Campion led UCSB with three shots on goal while Jome contributed two. Jome is quickly becoming a dangerous weapon for the Gauchos and is one of five freshmen starting for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“[Jome] just gets on everything. The thing about him is he competes, he’s fearless,” Vom Steeg said. “You look at a player like that and there’s no reason he shouldn’t potentially be the freshman of the year in the conference.”</p>\n<p>Freshman midfielder Paul Ehmann received a red card in the 89th minute, forcing the Gauchos to play a man down for the remaining minute plus. Luckily, a Lions’ comeback never materialized. Freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely posted his second career shutout Sunday.</p>\n<p>“We had 17 shots and we were dangerous. It was the first time we scored where we actually passed four times next to each other,” Vom Steeg said. “I thought all that was promising. At the end of the day we got the result we needed tonight. It was an important win going into league.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s highly anticipated match against Stanford (5-1-1) proved to be entertaining for the 7,750 fans in attendance. Tied at one apiece and in overtime, Stanford used the second goal of the day from freshman forward Jordan Morris in the 95th minute to clinch the victory.</p>\n<p>Morris scored in the 31st minute to give Stanford a 1-0 lead before senior defender Peter Schmetz scored his first goal of the season in the 53rd minute to tie the game and ultimately send it to overtime. Ehmann and sophomore forward Charlie Miller were credited with assists on the goal by Schmetz.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s offense struggled to convert opportunities into goals, a clear theme thus far in the season. The Gauchos outshot Stanford 12-8 with a 6-4 advantage in shots on goal.</p>\n<p>“I was a little bit frustrated after the Stanford game because I had a chance after four minutes and I missed it,” Boyoko said. “We have the chances, we just need to shoot on target and make the keeper make the save.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos open conference play on Friday when they host Cal State Fullerton. Kickoff is scheduled for 7:30 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of September 30, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52223\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/gauchos-split-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52223\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/gauchos-split-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/gauchos-split-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/gauchos-split-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/gauchos-split-pair-of-weekend-matches/","id":1599,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1598,1597,1596],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
