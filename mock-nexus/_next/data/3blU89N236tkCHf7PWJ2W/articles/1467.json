Cal Poly hosts its visiting rivals with a weary 3-7-2 overall record and a Big West record of 1-3-1.</p>\n<p>While the Mustangs are en route to finishing its worst season since 2011 when they finished 6-9-3, 3-6-1 in conference play, they still have shown the ability to beat top quality teams. Earlier in the 2016 campaign, Cal Poly upset then No. 6 UCLA 1-0 at home thanks to the senior forward Justin Dhillon’s early goal scored in the ninth minute.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Since that win in late September, Cal Poly began conference play and had yet to notch a win being shutout twice in contests at Big West South Leaders UC Riverside and against UC Irvine this past Saturday before picking up its first conference victory against UC Davis 2-1 on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Hoping to take advantage of the Mustangs’ struggles this year, the Gauchos will look to sweep their bitter, green rival for the first time since 2006 when they won both matchups by an identical score of 2-0. Coincidentally, that  season was the last — and only — time Santa Barbara won a NCAA championship after defeating UCLA 2-1 in the title match.</p>\n<p>All-time, UCSB dominates the series against Cal Poly 45-18-8 and 22-7-6 during the Vom Steeg Era. However, last year the Gauchos went 0-1-1 against the Mustangs and over the last five seasons have gone 3-4-3 in the previous 10 matches, with the two teams tying in one of the two games in each of the last three seasons.</p>\n<p>Last season, Cal Poly won its home match 3-2 in a crazy double overtime game, with now senior defender Kody Wakasa delivering the golden goal in the 103rd minute. Wakasa was named to the Preseason All-Conference Team, has put through one goal — tied for second best on the team — and has been solid on the back end this season, although the defense has been outscored 16-10.</p>\n<p>Leading the offensive charge for the Mustangs this season has usually been Dhillon, who scored seven of the team’s 10 total goals. The senior forward has had a brilliant career thus far as his goals (15), total points (40) and shots (137) are all tied for second most among active Big West players, while his assists rank third (11).</p>\n<p>Blocking the net for Cal Poly all season has been junior Eric Kam, who, after shutting out No. 6 UCLA, was honored with his first career Big West Men’s Soccer Defensive Player of the Week. This season the goalkeeper has played well, registering 31 saves on the season while surrendering 12 goals in 10 matches.</p>\n<p>In order to pull off the sweep, the Gauchos will need to be able to rely on key pieces who have been solid all season, such as junior midfielder Kevin Feucht, who leads the team in goals scored (8) and points (18)</p>\n<p>Another solid performer this year has been junior forward Ahinga Selemani. The Ann Arbor native, third on the team in goals with four and first on the squad in game-winning goals with three, put on spectacular performances against the Anteaters and Matadors last week and is worthy of being named Big West Offensive Player of the Week for the first time in his career.</p>\n<p>Against Sacramento State, Selemani continued his impressive season and scored his third goal in as many matches in a game that ended in a 1-1 tie.</p>\n<p>The rekindling of this rivalry always makes the fall season of sports that much more memorable. Last year at Cal Poly, the game was sold out with a max capacity crowd of 11,075, while the matchup at Santa Barbara’s Harder Stadium had the second largest campus crowd in NCAA history with 14,919 spectators.</p>\n<p>With 13 of the 19 largest crowds being courtesy of UCSB-Cal Poly matchups, it is clear that not only do the players love this rivalry, but the fans of NCAA soccer, current students at their respective schools and alumni do as well.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are set to face Cal Poly in the first of their two matchups Saturday, Oct. 15 at 7 p.m. at Alex G. Spanos Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The Titans improve to 15-3-1 overall and 7-3 in the Big West.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Fullerton came out swinging in the first half with Burkenroad’s goal the 11<sup>th</sup> minute. Senior forward Rebecca Wilson led Burkenroad down the field resulting in a chip shot past senior goalkeeper Beth Ritter, giving her team the early 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos quickly responded by scoring a goal in the 18<sup>th</sup> minute off a breakaway from sophomore forward Amanda Ball. Ball split her defenders and scored on an unassisted goal launching a shot into the back left of the net.</p>\n<p>The Chino Hills forward netted three goals in her final three games, the first being a game-winner in the Gauchos’ 1-0 victory over Fullerton last Tuesday. Ball has recorded all of her five goals on the year after missing eight games due to injury.</p>\n<p>Following Ball’s score the freshmen duo of Sydney Magnin and Maddie Gibson connected on a goal of their own. Magnin put Gibson in scoring position off a line drive touch pass. Making her way down the field, Gibson snuck the ball past Big West Keeper of the Year Jennifer Stuart into the back of the net.</p>\n<p>The All-Big West Freshman broke the 1-1 bind and secured her team a 2-1 lead heading into the halftime break. Magnin and Gibson have been key assets to this young UCSB team recording six of the freshman’s 22 goals and 13 points for the year.</p>\n<p>Opening up the second period it was the play of Burkenroad and Wilson that kept things in favor for the Titans. The senior veterans took control of the half with a goal from Burkenroad in the 47<sup>th</sup> and 63<sup>rd</sup> minute.</p>\n<p>Big West Offensive Player of the Year Rebecca Wilson tallied in her second and third assists on the night setting up Burkenroad yet again for two easy scores and the 3-2 advantage.</p>\n<p>With momentum on their side, the Titans sealed the deal off an insurance kick from midfielder Connie Caliz. The redshirt sophomore made her moment in front of goal count, registering her third goal of the season. Fullerton preserved their comfortable lead after that point keeping its playoff hopes alive with a 4-2 victory.</p>\n<p>Despite a high-charged attack from Fullerton, Santa Barbara had an efficient outing on offense as well. The Gauchos outshot the Titans 12-10 in shots on goal and 3-1 in corner kicks. While UCSB had many chances in front of goal it was unable to capitalize.</p>\n<p>Despite an unfortunate end to the year, there is nowhere to go but up for this young team. The Gauchos have exceeded expectations for the season after being projected to finish sixth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>As seniors Beth Ritter, Angelisa Cortez, and Savannah Francis end their collegiate careers at UCSB their roles will be handed down to their 19 underclassmen. Gaining valuable experience from a tough nonconference schedule, rigorous conference play, and this Big West Tournament, the Gauchos will look to build on their successful year next season.</p><div

Senior forward Matt Wiesenfarth played the hero in that game, scoring his fourth goal of the season on a breakaway in the 93rd minute.</p>\n<p>In UCSB and UC Davis’ two meetings this season, the Gauchos came away victorious thanks to three goals from sophomore holding midfielder Kevin Feucht, all of which came from the penalty spot.</p>\n<p>“The fact that we’ve gotten three goals from the spot means that we’re doing some damage in the box,” Selemani said. “Obviously you want to get goals in other fashions, but I think the fact that we’re getting goals is important and the fact we’re getting wins is all that matters right now.”</p>\n<p>In the two teams’ first meeting at Harder Stadium, the Gauchos lost a 1-0 lead after conceding a 74th minute goal to junior Steven Guzman. It was a trademark goal for Davis that was characteristic of the gameplan it has continued to utilize against UCSB, being scored by a defender following a scramble off a long throw into the box.</p>\n<p>“We have to have high pressure and keep them from scoring set piece goals because that’s where they’re most dangerous,” junior left back Ismaila Jome said. “Their two center backs have their most goals, so if we just keep them from getting any headers in the box and play as well as we have throughout the season we’ll be fine.”</p>\n<p>However, junior forward Nick DePuy was dragged down in the box just 50 seconds after the Aggies’ equalizer, leading to Feucht’s second penalty of the game and eventual game-winner.</p>\n<p>Davis brings to town a physical, sluggish style that serves as somewhat of a foil to UCSB’s more traditional approach of passing and making good runs into the box. The Gauchos ended the season with the eighth best offense in the nation, scoring 38 goals through 19 games.</p>\n<p>“They have two guys, [sophomore forward Evan Barrett and junior forward Dashiell MacNamara], who are pretty quick,” Selemani said. “We just need to make sure we take those guys down and we have a good chance to win again.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies’ offensive attack can be summed up by the fact that its top two goal scorers during the regular season were defenders in senior Lucas Mohageg and redshirt freshman Roy Boateng. They will be looking to keep the score low as they wait for their chance to pack the box and find a goal off a good ball in or a fortunate bounce.</p>\n<p>“We work on [clearing] every practice, but especially [this week],” Selemani said. “We had everybody setting up in [Davis’] formations and defended like we would tomorrow, so hopefully that works as well and we get the result.”</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos have had great success during conference play in recent years, they have been unable to get it done when it matters most, going 0-3 over the past two postseasons. That will likely change this time around with an experienced core group that has grown together over the years.</p>\n<p>“Since I’ve been here this is the best team as far as talent-wise, just collectively,” Jome said. “We have a good mix of younger guys and older guys and we know how big of a struggle it is to get into the postseason and win games.”</p>\n<p>Under Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg, who received a record fifth conference Coach of the Year Award, UCSB’s dominant record this season was reflected in its dominance of the Big West yearly awards.</p>\n<p>Nick DePuy earned his second consecutive Big West Offensive Player of the Year after scoring 15 goals through 19 games. To put that number in perspective, the four players who tied for second in goals in the conference had less than half of DePuy’s total with seven. Only one NCAA player, USC Upstate’s Gordon Wild (16), has scored more goals than him this year.</p>\n<p>The 6-4 DePuy has been unstoppable all season thanks to a combination of size, good feet, extremely accurate shooting, and an excellent supporting cast that has given him great service. All of these factors have helped catapult him to a nation-leading eight game-winning goals. His individual success has led to the team’s success ever since he switched from the midfield to forward midway through last season, proven by UCSB’s undefeated record of 16-0-4 in games he has scored in.</p>\n<p>DePuy’s aforementioned supporting cast includes Big West Freshman of the Year Geoffrey Acheampong, who scored four goals and led the Big West with 10 assists, good for sixth-best in the country. UCSB first-year players have now won the award in four consecutive seasons and six of the past seven.</p>\n<p>The former Cate School star received a Big West Honorable Mention alongside sophomore left back Randy Mendoza and freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg.</p>\n<p>Other players joining DePuy on the All-Big West First Team were Feucht, who was second on the team with five goals, junior midfielder Josue Espana, and senior defender Duncan Backus.</p>\n<p>Selemani rounds out the long list of Gauchos receiving accolades, being named All-Big West Second Team with four goals. He ranked third in the conference with 50 shots, putting a high amount of pressure on back lines all year to help free up space for his teammates.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will benefit from having 11 nights of rest since their last game against Davis on Halloween, thanks to their winning the No. 1 seed and a bye in the first round of the postseason. In that final regular season game against the Aggies, UCSB came away with a 1-0 victory after freshman forward Cody Gibson was taken down in the box, leading to another game-winning penalty by Feucht.</p>\n<p>The winner of Wednesday’s game will face the winner between Cal Poly and Cal State Fullerton on Saturday. If the Gauchos win, they will be at home for the championship game as they look to win their first Big West title since 2010.</p>\n<p>“Tomorrow is the biggest test because we haven’t made it to the final in [four] years,” Jome said. “The biggest challenge would just be winning tomorrow, and after that, we have to take it game by game.”</p>\n<p>Tomorrow’s game begins at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

After falling behind 1-0 early in the match just five days ago, Santa Barbara stormed back with goals from red-hot juniors Ahinga Selemani and Kevin Feucht to win the game 2-1.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The victory put the all-time record between these two squads at an even further distance as the Gauchos now lead the series all-time 46-18-8 and 23-7-6 during the Tim Vom Steeg era. The win was also a huge confidence boost as last year UCSB was winless in the two-match series going 0-1-1.</p>\n<p>Last season’s match at Harder Stadium was certainly an instant classic. The game attracted 14,919 spectators, the second-largest campus crowd in NCAA history, and ended in a stunning 2-2 tie after Cal Poly scored the equalizer with only four seconds left, overcoming what seemed to be an insurmountable 2-0 lead held by the home team for most of the match.</p>\n<p>With that being the lasting moment the remaining Gauchos had of the match against the Mustangs last year, it’s safe to say they are ready to come out and defeat them in front of what could be the largest crowd in NCAA history by the end of the night.</p>\n<p>Also on the line, Santa Barbara’s chance to sweep Cal Poly for the first time since 2006. That year also marked UCSB’s first and only national championship in program history.</p>\n<p>Hoping to deflate the home team and give them their first loss of the conference season will be senior forward Justin Dhillon who ranks third in the conference in goals scored with seven. The winger has scored 70 percent of the team’s total goals all season. His 17 total points also rank him first on his team, third in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Despite his great offense play, no other Mustang really comes to mind. Despite not scoring in last week’s match, the senior assisted in the only goal scored by Cal Poly in that game as freshman midfielder Christian Enriquez scored the first goal of his young career.</p>\n<p>One player to watch out for is Kody Wakasa. The senior defender made the shot of his life last season for his team scoring the game winning golden goal against the Gauchos in a 3-2 win at Cal Poly. This season Wakasa has registered one goal and has played exceptional in the back end, which has done a solid job despite what the overall record might entail.</p>\n<p>In fact, goalkeeper Eric Kam has been great for most of the season. The junior has the second-best goals allowed against average in the Big West with 1.21, while his save percentage of .706 ranks fourth in the conference with UCSB’s freshman goalie Tituoan Le Roux.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have been on fire as of late, especially the trio of DePuy, Selemani and Feucht. All three players are in the top-five goal scorers in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Feucht’s 10 goals rank first in the conference while also ranking seventh best in the entire nation. The midfielder scored the equalizer to help send the game into overtime against UC Davis on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Because of the Feucht’s goal, DePuy was able to score the 16th game winner of his career in front of the Aggies home stadium. Despite not having the season he had last year when he scored 15 goals and led the entire nation, the striker has still made a significant impact. In his career, the senior has scored four goals in seven appearances against the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>Last, but certainly not least on the list, is Selemani. Although not extending his goal streak to five matches after failing to score against UC Davis, the junior had the key assist to Feucht’s equalizer. In two of his three career appearances against Cal Poly, the junior has scored a goal and his six goals this season rank second best on the team, tied with DePuy.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73271\" style=\"width: 333px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73271\" data-attachment-id=\"73271\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-19/gauchos-head-to-uc-davis-to-continue-recent-unbeaten-run/jenny-luo-daily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C2400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,2400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-73271\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web-683x1024.jpg?resize=323%2C485\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"323\" height=\"485\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer-at-CalPoly-10162016-by-Jenny-Luo-8-web.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-73271\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>On the back end, the Gauchos have been solid thanks to the play of freshman Le Roux. The goalkeeper ranks third in the conference with 60 saves and has not allowed more than one goal in his last six matches; he is a respectable player, having done all this without missing a single minute in 16 starts this season.</p>\n<p>While, on paper, Santa Barbara clearly looks like the more dominant team, Cal Poly certainly has the tenacity to make this an interesting match. If last Saturday’s match was any indicator, the Gauchos might have their hands full this weekend if they are not careful.</p>\n<p>As recognized by most fans of college soccer, the Blue-Green clash is the best soccer rivalry in college soccer to date, and with that title comes the responsibility to give fans the greatest game they could possibly witness. Something tells me this match, like all the others that have been played, will not disappoint.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos face off against the Mustangs in the annual Blue-Green rivalry on Saturday, Oct. 22, at 8 p.m. at Harder Stadium. The game will also be televised on Fox Sports Prime Ticket.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
