As more students accept offers to attend UCSB, the amount of students who need on-campus housing increases.</p>\n<p>Because of this, the number of triples offered in San Nicolas grows year by year, according to Hurd.</p>\n<p>Spaces in the rooms were also left open for international students and emergency room situations, according to Hurd. Now, three weeks into the quarter, those vacancies are being addressed.</p>\n<p>The Department of Residential and Community Living finished accommodating all the students on the waiting list last week, meaning that the remaining vacancies in San Nicolas Hall would not be filled.</p>\n<p>For some students, this meant that those who originally requested triples now find themselves in double rooms.</p>\n<p>Residents who requested triples for financial reasons and found themselves in doubles were left with few options when notified of the de-tripling.</p>\n<p>It is within the right of UCSB to change a resident’s rooming situation from a double to a triple, or vice versa, at any time, according to the University Residence Hall Contract.</p>\n<p>“When one student vacates due to reassignment or termination of contract, the room reverts to a double occupancy room and the rate for the two remaining students increases to the double occupancy rate,” the housing contract reads.</p>\n<p>The estimated cost difference between a double and triple room for these residents totals $1675: $375 for the remainder of fall quarter, and $650 per quarter for winter and spring.</p>\n<p>Since all empty beds in previously-tripled rooms were removed from San Nicolas, affected residents are left with two options if they need to remain in a triple: a roommate swap or a residence hall switch.</p>\n<p>A roommate swap is when students communicate with other residents in the building who have a double room preference and swap rooms with them, Assistant Resident Director of San Nicolas Residence Hall Ruth Quintanilla said in an email.</p>\n<p>“This would allow you to move into a triple and switch with resident who wants a double,” she wrote.</p>\n<p>Both of these residents would fill out roommate swap forms and the resident being detripled could avoid paying the cost of a double room.</p>\n<p>For William Cui, a first-year statistical science major, a roommate swap led to finally getting the triple room type he originally requested. Cui and his roommate intended on being in a double, but due to over-enrollment of FSSP, were placed in a triple.</p>\n<p>“[We] were all set with a double until a few days before we moved in they told us we were stuck with a random third roommate,” Cui said in an email.</p>\n<p>“They had only sent out the original email notifying us about the possibility of doubles being turned into triples a week or so before our move in date.”</p>\n<p>As other rooms were being de-tripled, Cui connected with the Resident Director to switch rooms with two students who needed a triple for financial reasons.</p>\n<p>“We successfully switched with them so we live in a double now and the two people we switched with live in our old room with the third roommate we got assigned to. Our FSSP experience would have just been a lot better in general if we had gotten our double as originally planned and trying to move out was really tedious and stressful,” he added.</p>\n<p>While Cui and his roommate agreed to switch rooms, others who originally requested doubles but were placed in triples may not be as eager to do a roommate swap.</p>\n<p>For residents being de-tripled who cannot find residents to swap with, there is a second option: a residence hall switch, where a resident in a de-tripled room has the option of moving out of the building and into a different residence hall altogether. This process is facilitated by the resident director of San Nicolas Hall.</p>\n<p>Quintanilla said that if the switch from paying for a triple to paying for a double posed a concern for students, then they could file a Cost of Attendance appeal to the Office of Financial Aid.</p>\n<p>An email from University and Community Housing Services clarified that this option is only “for students who have expenses that supersede the budget allocation for rent.”</p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.5 of the Oct. 25 print edition of the</i> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

CSD) meeting Tuesday evening, said Bird had picked up 80 of its scooters and paid the $24 impound fee per scooter about two weeks ago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The impound fee is] a standard fee that a student would pay or anyone would pay,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California Police Department (UCPD) did not begin stringently impounding scooters until Dec. 3, Bowman said. While the university was putting together its interim policy, there was a warning period for scooters being ridden or found on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD began impounding scooters on a complaint basis for approximately a month after the warning period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[One] was parked in a handicapped zone. So somebody called that into the university police department and we went and picked it up to make that space available,” he said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Then, as the number of reported serious injuries result[ing] from local scooters [increased], coupled with national media coverage of how scooters were impacting communities across the nation, we stepped up our enforcement and started impounding more scooters on campus property.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several students have been fined for riding scooters on campus, which could cost them as much as $200, as per California legal code. UC Santa Barbara reminded students of the potential fine in an email sent out Dec. 10. The university also put up several posters around campus, particularly in the residence halls, as another reminder. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one instance, Bowman said, a student was offered the opportunity to either pay a reduced fine of $175 or complete community service. The student chose the latter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bowman also said several students have been injured riding scooters on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One was a significant gash to the forehead, that I’m sure required many stitches,” he said.  “The second was, from the pictures I could tell it was road rash, but the student was in a [cervical collar], or there was obvious concern of spinal injury.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bowman has only seen photos of two incidents, but confirmed that there have been several other scooter-related accidents on campus as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Goleta City Council implemented a ban on electric scooters in Goleta on Dec. 4, noting that Bird and Lime have a history of bringing their scooters to communities without the approval of local governments, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noozhawk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.noozhawk.com/article/goleta_council_votes_unanimously_to_ban_motorized_scooters\"> reported</a>.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V.

They also asked that Bird work with the district and other stakeholders to “mitigate negative impacts of its launch and actively work towards the public benefit.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But before the I.V. CSD could meet with Bird representatives, the scooters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/1045468577036296192\">launched</a> in I.V. on Sept. 27. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the CSD’s <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jhR6nprhAbHvmWoXQ2TI0xNj7ejKp4a7CdMIuK2DHbs/edit?fbclid=IwAR0f_mhzHEYh5I944a-hXiF54j8i-0FIQox939-6cxnQIet7zN2uUyf3kR8#heading=h.3remlxj1sk6u\">special meeting</a> on Oct. 30, they elected to present a set of recommendations to the County, supporting the use of electric scooters in I.V. with some stipulations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB has yet to implement a formal policy, although it put in place an interim <a href=\"https://www.policy.ucsb.edu/sites/www.policy.ucsb.edu/files/docs/policies/Interim_Electronic_Scooter_Policy.pdf\">policy</a> on Sept. 7 that <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/birds-wings-clipped-electric-scooter-ban-in-place-on-campus/\">banned</a> the scooters on campus property and gave UCPD the power to impound them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bowman said he’s seen less ridership on campus since the enhanced enforcement on campus, although it has led to other problems such as the creation of piles of scooters at campus boundaries like Pardall Tunnel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People will utilize them in Isla Vista for example, get that far, stop, end their ride, get off and then walk on campus,” Bowman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though it is potentially impactful to the chokepoints there, overall, from a campus safety standpoint, that seems like a win.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Bowman said UCSB and campus leadership will have to see what the next steps are. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are conscientious of the student population primarily that’s interested in having these as an available mode of transportation, but we have to always weigh that desire against public safety, being in law enforcement.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

said the proposed redefinition, which defines gender as the sex assigned at birth, would cause complications.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Trump administration’s proposed redefinition of gender would leave transgender students at UC Santa Barbara stuck in limbo between federal and state guidelines, according to Craig Leets, Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity director.</p>\n<p>Leets said the proposed redefinition, which defines gender as the sex assigned at birth, would cause complications particularly with passports, social security cards and insurance benefits.</p>\n<p>He has been working to advocate for LGBTQ students in higher education since 2012.</p>\n<p>“It’s really complicated for a trans person to get their gender marker with the federal government,” he said. “If [the redefinition] were to go through, there would be no chance at all for a trans person to change that gender marker that is on record with the federal government.”</p>\n<p>Transgender students travelling internationally run the risk of being held up in airports, both domestically and internationally.</p>\n<p>“Their appearance might align with one gender and [if] their gender marker on their passport says something different, that can cause problems for people who are going through customs,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>Insurance companies that operate across state lines would also be able to deny transgender students’ benefits, particularly to cover mental health or transitioning expenses, despite California’s more progressive laws.</p>\n<p>“Many things are more than just state-specific… which is where federal guidelines come in,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>California Senate Bill 179, which was signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in Oct. 2017, would allow California residents three options for their gender on their driver’s licenses and birth certificates: male, female and nonbinary, which is denoted by an ‘x.’</p>\n<p>The law fully goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2019, but the Trump administration’s attempts to redefine gender could override the state law.</p>\n<p>“If the federal government were to change that definition it could really impact all of the progress that has been made,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>On UCSB’s campus, students would not see any effects to the protections they are already afforded by the university and the state of California.</p>\n<p>“UCSB has a nondiscrimination policy, and there are a set of protected classes who are legally protected in the state of California… so someone cannot be discriminated against in accessing housing or employment based on their gender, gender identity or gender expression,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>“So our nondiscrimination policy, which aligns with those protected classes here in the state of California, would not be impacted or affected.”</p>\n<p>The Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) is currently working on two efforts to support transgender students on campus: first, by providing a community-building space for trans students on campus and second, by implementing policy changes within the university.</p>\n<p>Currently, the center is working on cataloging the number and location of all-gender restrooms on campus. They are also trying to expand the preferred name option on Gaucho On-Line Data (G.O.L.D.) to include pronouns.</p>\n<p>According to Leets, there are approximately 70 all-gender restrooms on campus, with the majority of those being single-stall restrooms.</p>\n<p>Through the RCSGD’s work to establish a map of all-gender restrooms on campus, it has identified a corridor on Ocean Road by the Gevirtz Graduate School of Education and Robertson Gym where there are several buildings without a single all-gender restroom.</p>\n<p>“If a student is in one of those classes, one of those buildings or they have multiple classes in those buildings, it’s really hard for them to find a restroom space that’s close enough by for them to get between classes or for them to go during a class,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>Ideally, Leets would like to establish several all-gender restrooms in all buildings on campus, but says the more realistic goal is at least one in every building “so a student or faculty or staff-person would not have to leave the building that they’re in to have an accessible restroom option.”</p>\n<p>The RCSGD is currently in the inventory phase of the project. Once it identifies priority spots, like the Ocean Road corridor, it will begin requesting funding and approval to convert existing restrooms to all-gender restrooms.</p>\n<p>Leets said the center is also working with the university to expand the preferred name option already available for students.</p>\n<p>For students who have not or cannot change their legal name, they can currently change their preferred name on G.O.L.D. This change will be reflected in numerous locations including their access card, GauchoSpace, G.O.L.D., advising records, the online campus directory and housing rosters.</p>\n<p>“In many places, students will be able to see their preferred name and not have to interact with their legal name. That system is pretty good; we’re just trying to make sure it’s as good as it needs to be,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>As a partner project, they are also working toward including pronouns in the university system in the same places the preferred name already appears.</p>\n<p>Despite the work they’ve already done, projects like these often take longer than the center hopes them to.</p>\n<p>“I think many people want to do that work [to support trans students] and are excited to do that work … The challenge that comes from any large organization [is], ‘Is the money there?’, ‘What’s the technical complications of making these changes,’” he said.</p>\n<p>Leets said the center works closely with Vice Chancellor Margaret Klawunn and Associate Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Maria Herrera-Sobek.</p>\n<p>“Our role on campus is to be the leaders of the advocacy and improvement on campus for trans students,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>“[The administration is] supporting the work that we are doing and help[s] us to make movement when we can’t ourselves to try and make campus more welcoming for trans students.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Their students, in turn, are unable to access several tools, McClelland said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elrod said there is a “variety of benefits” that employees get, but the lack of registration has resulted in them not receiving the benefits to which they are entitled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UAW 2865 and Graduate Student Association (GSA) have been working together in an attempt to help students avoid losing benefits and payment for their work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve written up a collective survey together that we’ve been circulating on our list serves, sending to our department reps in GSA on Facebook, trying to get as many graduate students as possible who are having issues to respond to it,” GSA President Cierra Sorin said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Student workers] should also recognize that the only way to speak to the university as an equal would be through… [a] collective response,” Elrod said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCPath malfunction has also affected undergraduate students who work within the school as tutors or readers, according to Daniel Lazar, one of the UAW 2865 Head Stewards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The union stated that they are working closely with the GSA to make sure students do not feel as though they are isolated and to make sure the university upholds their end of the contract.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The larger issue is whether students will band together to bring attention to the issue, Elrod said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lazar also expressed frustration over the university’s lack of quick and detailed responses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’ve just been stonewalling and haven’t responded. I’ve actually gotten contradictory information about the causes of the error… It’s clearly a university-wide problem, and there hasn’t been a university-wide response to it,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Union objected to the transition to UCPath from the start because these issues had already occurred at other universities last year. Despite this, the university proceeded with the transition, McClelland said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the issues are not resolved soon, UCPath members will not receive their October paychecks, leaving students unsure of their ability to pay rent, according to McClelland.</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.6 of the Oct. 25 print edition of the</i> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84532\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84532\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/","id":2196,"author":{"id":64,"name":"Aaron Berkness"},"related":[2195,2194,2193],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
