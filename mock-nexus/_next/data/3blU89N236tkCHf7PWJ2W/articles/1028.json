Although we are still a couple months away from Big West Conference play, UCSB keeps its focus on this visiting Cal Lutheran side.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting their season on the road, the Gauchos are primed and ready for their short home stay. Entering this one, the Gauchos currently stand at a 1-1 overall in their young campaign. The hosts are also coming off a recent defeat to their previous opponents, North Dakota State, whom they fell short to by a score of 82-63. UCSB will want to return to its winning ways in front of fans as it eagerly awaits tipoff versus its neighbors to the south.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Cal Lutheran, its season has just begun as the Kingsmen will be playing their first game of the year at the Thunderdome; this will be their first matchup of a two-game road trip before they debut at home on Saturday. Cal Lutheran is coming off a disappointing campaign, as their last season’s record concluded at 9-15, with a total win percentage of only .375. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This also translates to a poor performance in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC), as Cal Lutheran finished 6-10 against opponents, which was good enough for a sixth-place finish in SCIAC conference standings. The Kingsmen will be looking for an upset win on the road in order to start their new season on the right foot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historically, this is the first time these two teams will be facing off against each other. Still, there will be no love lost as both men’s basketball programs are looking to take control of their destinies this early on in the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early standout players, for the Gauchos, would be sophomore guards JaQuori McLaughlin and Devearl Ramsey. It’s been the underclassmen show so far — the pair has combined for 54 points through the first two matches of the season. McLaughlin is currently shooting 100 percent from the free-throw line, with a perfect stat line of 11-11 from the charity stripe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Ramsey, he’s shooting at an even 50 percent field goal percentage, currently hitting 7-14 from inside the arc. This young sophomore duo has not only been electric but also a key component for the Gauchos, as they have a team-leading amount of minutes played at 64 and 62, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the forward position, the Gauchos are also finding success in freshman Amadou Sow, who has found plenty of playing time already, with 55 minutes already under his belt through his first pair of collegiate starts. He’s also made the most of his time so far as he leads UCSB in total rebounds, with 13, and is tied with Ramsey in total steals, with two apiece. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the young prospects are already proving their talent, the Gauchos’ lineup also boasts a veteran presence with senior Jarriesse Blackmon. Only one rebound away from tying with Sow, Blackmon has also dominated the forward position with a team-leading three blocks to his name. The consistency from this rim-protecting and playmaking duo will be crucial to the Gauchos’ extended success down the line.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attending fans should have plenty to be excited about, as tip-off against Cal Lutheran is set at 7 p.m. tonight at the Thunderdome. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

She allowed just one hit while striking out two batters.</p>\n<p>The performances from the circle were surely the story of this matchup. Collins started it off by throwing three scoreless innings and junior Shelby Wisdom would come in to copy that same performance. Freshman Ashlee Ludlow entered in the last inning and recorded two strikeouts in her first NCAA appearance. The pitching staff combined for eight strikeouts and only allowed two hits in the entire game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ last matchup came on Saturday morning against a very strong Northwestern University team (11-4). The team struggled throughout and ended up dropping the game 10-1 as the game was cut to just five innings due to the mercy rule.</p>\n<p>Wisdom had her talents tested when she entered the game with her microscopic ERA of 2.27 and ended up with four earned runs, including a home-run to senior infielder Marisa Bast.</p>\n<p>The team struggled on both ends of the ball as it could only score one run in the entire game. Only four players were able to find a way to hit against the strong pitching of sophomore Kristen Wood, who picked up her sixth win of the season and accounted for eight strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Despite Wood’s strong performance from the circle, Santa Barbara’s Clark was able to get her usual couple of hits, going 2-3 and improving her tournament batting average to an outstanding 9-11 (.818).</p>\n<p>The team was scheduled to play in six games this weekend, but three of them were cancelled over the course of the tournament due to excessive rainfall.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to take their 11-5 record to Reno, Nevada this upcoming weekend for the Nevada Classic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of March 3, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54307\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/ucsb-goes-3-1-in-long-beach-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54307\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/ucsb-goes-3-1-in-long-beach-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/ucsb-goes-3-1-in-long-beach-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/ucsb-goes-3-1-in-long-beach-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/ucsb-goes-3-1-in-long-beach-tournament/","id":1027,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[1026,1025,1024],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Opens its Season This Weekend at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos face Dayton in their first game of the 2014 season","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB softball team looks to kick off its season at home this weekend with the 2014 Gaucho Classic.</p>\n<p>Four different teams will be competing in the round-robin tournament including Cal State Bakersfield, Dayton and Texas A&amp;M.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, who had an overall record of 31-24 and a conference record of 12-12 last year, will play in four games at Campus Diamond including a double header on Friday.

As a freshman, Palomares was a huge offensive surge as she reeled in 50 hits and had an average of .307 overall, ranking her second on the team behind Soria.</p>\n<p>The presence of Palomares last year beautifully complemented the “small-ball” style of play that the Gauchos present by getting on base and creating scoring opportunities for the team.</p>\n<p>Another player who is sure to make some noise for Santa Barbara this weekend is junior pitcher Shelby Wisdom. Wisdom, a former Big West Freshman of the year and All Big West team selection, is a double-sided knife for the Gauchos on the diamond with outstanding defense and offense.</p>\n<p>Last year she stood in the circle almost twice as much as any other pitcher with 43 appearances, 27 of them being starts. She pitched a total of 193.1 innings, while no other pitchers reached 100 innings on the year, and recorded an earned run average of 3.19, 136 strikeouts and 17 wins.</p>\n<p>Her defense in the circle is dominating but it is not limited to pitching, as the coaching staff is no stranger to sticking the junior in the outfield on days that she doesn’t pitch or even after they bring in another pitcher. This strategy used by head coach Brie Galicinao is without a doubt to keep her on the field for offense.</p>\n<p>Last year Wisdom ranked third on the team in batting average with .299 and first in RBI’s as she drove in 41 for UCSB. Her ability to get big hits (.545 SLG%, 8 HR’s) provides a surge for the Gauchos that allows the team to take control of games early and for her to close out the match with her arms. Anytime a player can superbly provide their own run support, they will surely be a threat to any team. Her Babe-Ruth-like style has made her very valuable to Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Being that this is the opening of the season for the Gauchos, look to see an appearance from some of the new additions of the team. In the off-season UCSB picked up six freshman, three outfielders, two infielders and a pitcher. With some proficient and disciplined play by the Gauchos this weekend, these younger players will get a chance to put their cleats on NCAA grass for the first time.</p>\n<p>First pitch will be thrown at 10 a.m. Friday morning against Dayton at Campus Diamond.</p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53883\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/ucsb-opens-its-season-this-weekend-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53883\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/ucsb-opens-its-season-this-weekend-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/ucsb-opens-its-season-this-weekend-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/ucsb-opens-its-season-this-weekend-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/ucsb-opens-its-season-this-weekend-at-home/","id":1026,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[1025,1024,1023],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Softball Brings in Six New Recruits Next Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SoftballGame15_KevinYang_05.10.2013.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SoftballGame15_KevinYang_05.10.2013.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"One year after finishing just a win short of the Big West Conference title, the UCSB softball team took a step back this season as they ended with a .500 conference record and a fourth-place finish. �...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>One year after finishing just a win short of the Big West Conference title, the UCSB softball team took a step back this season as they ended with a .500 conference record and a fourth-place finish.</p>\n<p>“A lot of those freshmen got game experience and they filled some pretty key roles for us,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “They had some big performances, and there’s a lot of room for them to get even better physically and mentally.

The gifted 6’1” athlete has not only signed on to play pitcher aside standouts sophomore Shelby Wisdom and freshman Alex Pingree, but she will also be playing for UCSB volleyball in the fall. In her junior year, she struck out 277 batters and maintained a .429 batting average.</p>\n<p>“We’ll have five pitchers and she’ll also be playing volleyball here at UCSB too,” Galiciano said. “She can come in and make an impact right away.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos were generally solid on defense this past season, they struggled to put up runs at times. Incoming outfielder and three-time Fountain Valley Offensive Player of the Year Emily Brucelas should be able to help with the offensive woes.</p>\n<p>“It’s always a transition going from high school to travel to college, but she’ll be a hitter who can adjust playing at this level,” Galicinao said. “She’s pretty aggressive offensively and I think she’ll be pretty consistent at this level.”</p>\n<p>Another player with good potential to help on the offensive side is Texas native Kristen Clark. With a good swing and great speed, she can also help fill in the outfield, an area that was once controlled by Soria’s speed.</p>\n<p>“She’s somebody who’s fast from the right side, but she can hit for power and also play the short game,” Galicinao said. “She’s pretty softball-savvy and just an all-around athlete.”</p>\n<p>Also adding to the depth of the outfield is Sunkist League MVP Stacy Cavazos. In her senior year, she hit at an incredible .544 clip and had 54 RBI.</p>\n<p>“She’s the other fast one,” Galicinao said. “She’s a triple threat that hits from the left side and can also hit it over the fence. After she signed on, she asked what she should do. I said ‘Just stay fast,’ and she did.”</p>\n<p>While most of the other recruits are versatile players who can play multiple positions, local native utility Rieanna Thomas is the only one who will have it in her job description. As a utility, she will be able to chip in by playing multiple positions on the field.</p>\n<p>Rounding out the recruits is outfielder Jackie Hinojosa from Saint Francis High School. In her junior year, she had a .531 batting average and scored 22 runs.</p>\n<p>Overall, the speed and versatility of the incoming freshmen should make an instant impact.
