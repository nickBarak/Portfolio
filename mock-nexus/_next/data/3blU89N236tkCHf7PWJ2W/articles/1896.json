The two admininstrators have primarily been the ones communicating with students regarding incidents of sexual violence in the community.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the eight demands released on Monday includes formally requesting a statement of acknowledgement “from Sigma Pi and other fraternities involved in recent sexual violence and misconduct apologizing to survivors, acknowledging the perpetuation of rape culture, and denouncing the actions of removed members.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In October, the Nexus </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/sigma-pi-removes-fraternity-member-following-sexual-assault-allegations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that a Sigma Pi member had been removed from the fraternity after the fraternity president learned of sexual assault allegations against the member involving two separate women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus spoke with one of the women, who said she reported the sexual assault to Sigma Pi’s president after she learned that the same fraternity member had allegedly sexually assaulted another woman later the same night, Oct. 3. The woman said at the time that she did not file a report with the university or local police. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later in October, another person reported to the university that they had been raped in a bedroom at the Sigma Pi house. On Oct. 28, UCSB sent out a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/rape-reported-at-sigma-pi-house-third-sexual-assault-allegation-in-past-month/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">timely warning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding the report, but the warning did not clarify if the suspect in the case was a member of fraternity or not. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB chapter of Sigma Pi has yet to publicly comment on the allegations of sexual assault made against former or current members or reports of sexual assault that have occurred on fraternity property. The national office of Sigma Pi said in October that they had </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-30/sigma-pi-operations-suspended-by-national-executive-office-while-ucsb-investigates-sexual-assault-allegations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">suspended operations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the UCSB chapter while the university and local law enforcement investigated the allegations, but they did not respond to follow up questions at the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Nexus reached out on Monday regarding the status of the chapter’s suspension, the national office did not respond. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In regards to keeping fraternities accountable, Intersectional Feminists is demanding that, moving forward, fraternity leaders be designated as mandatory reporters “of suspected sexual misconduct under Title IX.” Mandatory reporters, otherwise known as “</span><a href=\"https://oeosh.ucsb.edu/titleix/sexual.harassment.and.sexual.violence/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">responsible employees</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” are “required to notify the Title IX office if a student brings information about, or an employee becomes aware of, a possible incident of sexual violence or sexual harassment.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group also demands that any fraternity accused of sexual misconduct be suspended while it is investigated, and that communication with the student body regarding reports of sexual misconduct at a fraternity or a fraternity’s suspension must be “immediate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two other demands on the list address the university’s communication after incidents of sexual violence. The university </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/speculation-and-scrutiny-community-reacts-to-timely-warning/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was criticized</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the fall for its slow response to the October reports, after which university officials held a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-administration-addresses-students-concerns-following-fraternity-sexual-assault-allegations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">town hall</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> meeting to address students’ concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One demand would require the university to also keep UCSB staff and faculty in the loop through emails from the university regarding the actions it is taking to address sexual violence. Youssef said that one of the responses the survey had received was from a staff member who was receiving timely warnings regarding incidents of sexual violence, but didn’t receive any follow-up communication from the university that students were receiving, such as </span><a href=\"https://t.e2ma.net/webview/c5to3e/6d9fb6f180a39341b8837e9b18119fec\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this email</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from Klawunn and Armistead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another demand calls for a “transparent” Clery Student Right To Know daily log and for a University of California Police Department (UCPD) crime map. While the UCPD currently maintains a daily log of “crimes that have been reported to the University of California Police Department” and a map, Youssef said the organization would like to see more consistently updated versions of both. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organization is also demanding that </span><a href=\"http://campusclimate.ucop.edu/overview/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">campus climate surveys</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which survey “faculty and other academic appointees, students, staff, trainees, and post-doctoral scholars about their experiences and perceptions of campus or workplace climate,” be conducted on a more consistent basis and include questions regarding sexual violence that occurred on- or off-campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC conducted its first system-wide campus climate study between fall 2012 and spring 2013; UCSB was found to have the highest reported rate of “‘unwanted sexual contact’ while at UCSB within the last five years,” the Santa Barbara Independent </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2014/04/01/ucsb-students-happy-but-sexual-misconduct-concerns-exist/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to more frequent surveys, Intersectional Feminists wants “relevant student entities or groups” to be able to “review, edit and contribute to the drafting process” of the surveys. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once conducted, the results must be widely shared and publicized to the student body, the organization said. Jonathan Abboud, the Associated Students President in 2014, criticized the university for not widely publicizing the survey results in an </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/survey-reveals-campus-comfort-level/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interview</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with the Nexus after they were first released. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several of the demands are also centered around safety and assisting survivors; the organization is demanding that the Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) office has its funding increased to be able to put on more workshops and to hire two “institutionalized” prevention education coordinators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current prevention education coordinator is funded by a grant that C.A.R.E. received in fall 2018, according to C.A.R.E. Director Briana Conway. Ulloa said the goal of this demand was to build upon the work the current prevention education coordinator is doing and make the position permanent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final demand on the list calls for “mandatory faculty research on perpetrators, not just survivors.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youssef said that demand also came from a UCSB staffer, who is currently conducting research on survivors of sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to kind of shift the focus to perpetrators, and why are they doing that,” Youssef said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That demand is specifically is shifting towards acknowledging rape culture,” Ulloa added. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The Daily Nexus was able to sit down with Alonso and get his thoughts on the biggest college soccer rivalry in the country, and what it’s like approaching it from a Mustang point of view.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Omar Hernandez: So you were able to break the tie and score what would turn out to be the game-winning goal in the last matchup between Cal Poly and UCSB. How did it feel to mark your own place in this historic rivalry?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Diego Alonso:</strong> It was an honor, to be honest. We always look forward to the hype surrounding this rivalry and this game, and to score the winning goal was a dream come true. Just having that sold-out crowd cheering behind me — I couldn’t have asked for a better opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong>OH: An interesting pattern these last few years has been the domination by the home side of this matchup. What do you think has led to this discrepancy?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>DA:</strong> Obviously the home crowd is a big advantage for us. In Spanos the stands are a lot closer, so we can really feel that energy. We definitely get motivated by all the chants you guys yell at us at Harder (Laughter), but the feeling of being in front of the home crowd is a different level.</p>\n<p><strong>OH: You sure the tortillas don’t make a difference?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>DA:</strong> Well we don’t do much of that over at our place (Laughter). But yeah, whenever we get fouled or a throw-in by your guys’ sideline, we definitely know those tortillas are coming.</p>\n<p><strong>OH: Getting on a more personal note, what does this rivalry mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>DA:</strong> I actually didn’t know about it when I first committed to Cal Poly. But just seeing it from the bench my freshman year really showed me why people consider it one of the biggest rivalries in the country. These games have a professional atmosphere, and even though they’re regular-season games, they feel like a finals or postseason matchup. We always say that the Blue-Green rivalry has to stay green, so playing in it you feel like you’re not just playing for yourself or your teammates but for the pride of the whole school.</p>\n<p><strong>OH: I don’t want to get you in trouble with Coach Sampson, but what is some of the strategy you guys have talked over heading into Saturday? Both you guys and the Gauchos seem to play a similar style of soccer.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>DA:</strong> We try to do what the matchups command. So… [with those] last few games against CSUN and Sac State, our philosophy was keeping the ball on the ground and playing with our brains. When we play UCSB, we know that you guys have that height at the center-back. We know that games like those can get real chippy and physical, so going into SB, we didn’t talk too much strategy. We just know we have to win every ball in the air, win those 50-50 balls and just win the physical battle.</p>\n<p><strong>OH: Alright, you gotta settle one thing for me: Whose campus is better?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>DA:</strong> I’ve actually never been to UCSB’s campus so I can’t really speak to that (Laughter).</p>\n<p><strong>OH: Alright, whose city? Santa Barbara or SLO? Be honest with me; there’s a right answer and a wrong one.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>DA:</strong> Alright, I’ll give it to Santa Barbara on this one.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on P. 8 of the Oct. 25 print version of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

But his good deed was prevented from happening as liability concerns during the T-Dome’s after hours prohibited entrance aside from Gordon and his crew.</p>\n<p>But fans waiting in the night managed to get something in return as Gordon’s persistent plea to at least let fans in the gym to take photos was permitted prior to him beginning his workout.</p>\n<p>Although not in attendance, UCSB men’s basketball Head Coach Joe Pasternack’s presence was still felt as Gordon’s appearance was a reminder of the new coach’s aim to reestablish fun and excitement into the Gaucho program.</p>\n<p>“UCSB has shown love. Since I’ve been in Santa Barbara, [I figured] I’d peek through here, come through and get workouts in, they’ve always shown love,” Gordon said. “Now that Joe Pasternack is here, he’s shown love to me since I was on the Oakland Soldiers, playing with Archbishop Mitty [High School]. It’s just good to have a friend out here, he gets us in the gym. I wish I could have got everybody in [the Thunderdome], but you know there’s rules and regulations. It’s good to have Joe here, he’s really going to help the program out a lot.”</p>\n<p>During Pasternack’s tenure with the University of Arizona from 2011-2016, Gordon was a “one and done” player for the Wildcats in their 2013-14 season. He is one of many players, including former Wildcat and current Detroit Pistons forward Stanley Johnson who was training in the Thunderdome two weeks ago, that Pasternack played a significant role in when recruiting and developing the two All-American talents.</p>\n<p>Entering his fourth NBA season, Gordon is coming off a career year in which he started in 72 of 80 games and recorded a career-high 12.7 points per game.</p>\n<p>The former No. 4 pick of the 2014 NBA Draft is focused on the well-being of his body going into next season after a foot injury gave him trouble entering the All-Star break, which was evident in his underwhelming performance in the 2017 Slam Dunk Contest.</p>\n<p>“That’s the biggest thing, to get healthy. Find a rhythm, get healthy. As long as I’m healthy, everything ‘s going to be golden. I’ma do what I love to do,” Gordon said.</p>\n<p>With many aware of his freakish athleticism, Gordon has his sight set on taking his game further. Speculation as to whether or not he fits best at the small forward or power forward position had been up for debate throughout the majority of the season. No permanent answer has emerged regarding Gordon’s placement, but he flourished throughout the season.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y4Subr0F21k?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>When asked about the area of his game that he is focusing on this offseason, Gordon kept it straightforward – “shooting threes.”</p>\n<p>With that being said, he seems to remain motivated to fill the hybrid/stretch role that Orlando is hoping for him to be. If health can work in his favor, anticipating a breakout season for Gordon may not be too far-fetched.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78161\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-26/orlando-magic-forward-aaron-gordon-surprises-ucsb-trains-in-thunderdome/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78161\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-26/orlando-magic-forward-aaron-gordon-surprises-ucsb-trains-in-thunderdome/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-26/orlando-magic-forward-aaron-gordon-surprises-ucsb-trains-in-thunderdome/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-26/orlando-magic-forward-aaron-gordon-surprises-ucsb-trains-in-thunderdome/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-26/orlando-magic-forward-aaron-gordon-surprises-ucsb-trains-in-thunderdome/","id":1893,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1892,1891,1890],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Blacksmith of Education: UCSB Professor Talks Forging the Tools for Success","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-01-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Lash-Ted.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Lash-Ted.jpg?resize=600%2C450&ssl=1","description":"With his own life experiences in mind, Rios said he is dedicated to helping others go about their lives in a way that makes them feel supported — and never alone.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While growing up in Oakland, California, Victor Rios lived a life defined by struggle.

That’s just my environment,” he said in an interview with the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But neither of those things happened. Through perseverance and mentorship, he reshaped his destiny. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rios, 42, is now a professor in the sociology department at UC Santa Barbara and the subject of a new documentary called “The Pushouts,” which traces through 25 years of his life and his work with a youth center in Watts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, Rios studies underprivileged youth with upbringings similar to his own. Akin to finding a cure for a disease, Rios said “there is no silver bullet” in solving the problem of underprivileged youth and social disparities. But after 15 years of research, he said he has noticed a pattern. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all need a Yoda in life, right?” Rios said. “You want to have someone to turn to when you’re having a rough time and you want someone to turn to when you need an answer to a question that’s difficult to answer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But for many of us, we might not have that Yoda.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And for a long time, Rios himself didn’t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But one day, while sitting in a high school computer science class, his teacher, Flora Russ, extended him an offer he had never been given before. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Russ] would always say to me when she saw me at school, ‘Victor, you might not be ready right now, but when you’re ready, I’ll be here for you,’” Rios said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I was having a really tough time, when I hit rock bottom and my best friend had been killed and I was looking for that opportunity, I talked to her,” he added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Russ told him that she’d be glad to help, but he had to put in the work to make it happen. At the end of high school, Rios graduated on time and went on to receive his bachelor’s degree at California State University, East Bay and later attended graduate school at UC Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rios said Russ was different because “she cared for the whole person.” She enabled him to consistently spend time in school instead of on the streets and would “even go to my house and look for me and ask how I was doing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His personal experience with Russ cemented his belief in the importance of using guidance as a key for success. Along with empathy, which Rios described as “step one” to supporting students, the role of a teacher and education system should not only tell students how to succeed but also show them, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rios finds that the education system has a habit of pushing students aside that can’t keep up, leaving them stuck where they are. Instead, Rios believes that every student should have the power to control their education without the threat of being told “you’re not ready. You’re no longer part of this career trajectory.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This style of education is otherwise known as mastery learning, according to Rios, in which students are encouraged and supported in their studies by using tools and resources provided to them to achieve their goals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mastery learning contrasts traditional classes, Rios said, where “the first thing you hear from a professor is, ‘Welcome everyone. Half of you are going to fail this class,’” leading to student drop out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But using the label “dropout” puts blame in the wrong place, according to Rios. Instead, he uses the term “pushout” to better address the situation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we label a kid a dropout, it puts all the blame on them, ignoring whatever issues the student may have,” Rios told NBC. “Pushout is a better term, because it forces schools and educators to think about who they are failing, and what they can do about it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If educators encouraged more than discouraged, Rios believes students would experience a system that supports them at their lowest and lends a hand when they’ve been knocked down. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good example is in the classroom, where Rios said students’ academic outcomes are increased when teachers hone in on the emotional side of their students, which can take as little as five minutes per class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Education really has to be, from kindergarten all the way to college, an experience where you feel as a student that someone’s got your back. That someone is feeling what you’re going through and respecting what you’re going through,” Rios said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a professor, Rios does just that and supports students in the same manner he said Russ supported him: with acceptance and empathy. When students approach him for help, Rios acknowledges that he’s not a “mental health expert,” but as a mentor, will always do what he can. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To have a college student come to you and say, ‘I’m feeling a little broken inside,’ and kind of brush it off — you can’t do that,” Rios said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of [my] best therapeutic moments have not been with mental health experts, professionals or therapists. My best mental health moments have been with my mentors, with my Yodas and with my guides.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the 2014 tragedy in Isla Vista, Rios, alongside a handful of other professors, began hosting “midnight office hours” in Isla Vista to offer students an outlet for support. The idea came out of empathy, according to Rios — he and his colleagues wanted to support students at a time when emotions were at a high and hope was at a low. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students would get a kick out of it because some of them would show up drunk with tequila bottles in their hand. They’d call me by my last name … and we just sat there, a group of professors, and talked to students,” Rios said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of them, though, you could tell they were lonely. They were roaming the streets of Isla Vista on their own, sober. But [they] just needed someone to talk to,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a larger level, Rios would like to see society move away from some of its “punitive” qualities and opt for more compassionate methods, such as restorative justice and giving students second chances. In turn, Rios envisions a society where people are more empathetic to one another’s struggles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With his own life experiences in mind, Rios said he is dedicated to helping others go about their lives in a way that makes them feel supported — and never alone. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My noble purpose is to help those that are suffering and struggling to find a way out, and then have them go and help others,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s how we build a more compassionate world.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the January 9 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
