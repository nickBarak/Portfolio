However, the Vikings earned some home court stability as they returned to Portland for their next two matches. Following a squeaky 71-64 win over UC Riverside, the Vikings routed Willamette as they dropped a hearty 125 points in the runaway victory.</p>\n<p>Quarterbacked by sophomore guard Holland Woods, a Phoenix, Arizona native, the Vikings attack has outscored opposition with 84.6 points per game while holding opponents to just 69.7 points against per contest. Woods has averaged 14.3 points over three games while chiming in for an average of 4.3 assists and 3.0 steals in each match.</p>\n<p>Woods is complemented in the frontcourt by senior forward Jamie Orme who’s followed close behind the sophomore guard in scoring the season. Orme has delivered 13.7 PPG average along with a team-high 7.0 rebounds per game. Off the bench, look out for junior college transfer guard Michael Nuga who has posted 11.3 points on average while shooting 61.9% from the field.</p>\n<p>In game two of the two-day Holiday Classic, the Gauchos will take on a feisty University of Idaho squad that has opened up the year with a 1-2 record. The Vandals suffered early losses to UC Irvine and Nicholls State in the first games of the year but bounced back last Sunday with a convincing 87-59 triumph over Bethesda.</p>\n<p>Although four Vandals have averaged double-digit points through their first three contests, Idaho has struggled with depth as it carries a noticeably young roster with only 3 upperclassmen. The offensive attack is centered around freshman guard Cameron Tyson who has averaged 20 points through three games.</p>\n<p>Tyson is an efficient shooter who boats a 59.5% from the field, but the first year doesn’t share the ball often and is not a threat on the boards. Tyson is complemented in the backcourt by a pair of junior guards in Trevon Allen and Marquell Fraser.</p>\n<p>The Vandal offense is run through Fraser who distributes a team-high 5.0 assists per game while securing another team-high 8.0 rebounds per contest. The junior has also added 10 points per game on an average of 31.5 minutes.</p>\n<p>The story of the year for the Gauchos has been their immediate success on the year with four newcomers in a starting role. As preseason All-Big West Conference standout Max Heidegger has been off the floor battling a concussion, the Gauchos have maintained an impressive scoring presence throughout four games.</p>\n<p>However, the wait may finally be over as Heidegger tweeted “almost back” around 10 p.m. on Monday evening which sparked a flurry of hypotheticals for the upcoming back-to-back weekend.</p>\n<p>Although the star point guard’s return might be just around the corner, you can count on the Gauchos offense to strike with a sweeping arsenal in Boise over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Tip-off for game one of the Vandal Holiday Hoops Showcase is on Black Friday at 4 p.m. as the Gauchos face off against Portland State before they shift their attention to a contest with the Idaho Vandals at 6 p.m. on Saturday evening at CenturyLink Arena in Boise, Idaho.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

id=\"caption-attachment-83246\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Peyton Stotelmyre/DAILY NEXUS</p></div>\n<p>One of the most often-used phrases in all levels of men’s sports is “man up.” Whether it be a high school basketball player overcoming a rough shooting stretch or a college goalie fighting through an injury to stay in the game, the first lesson that young men are taught as athletes is that pain and sadness and discomfort are obstacles to overpower. To be a man in the world of sports is to shut out fear and uncertainty, to exude aggressiveness and passion and to limit doubt and over-thinking. To be a man is to win.</p>\n<p>Other than the archaic gendered connotations of the phrase, these lessons aren’t necessarily bad on paper. Many coaches point to the application of what they teach even outside of sports as rationale for why athletes should listen. American society is theoretically organized to value self-confidence and hard work. There’s supposed to be winners and losers, and if you believe in yourself and put in the work then you can achieve anything. We use Kobe Bryant’s relentless perfectionism, LeBron James’ refined diet and workouts and Michael Jordan’s extreme work ethic as examples of those at the top getting to where they are by devotion and, more importantly, by choice. Of course they are successful; they chose to work hard to get there.</p>\n<p>Due to the innate link between economic success and happiness in the American consciousness, this ultimately comes to mean that they chose to be happy, and by extension anyone else with just some hard work and elbow grease can choose to be happy too. But what about the millions of people who don’t always have the opportunities or resources or neurological capabilities to “choose” to be happy — where do they fit in?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Toronto Raptors’ perennial All-Star DeMar DeRozan made headlines recently because of an interview around this topic with the Toronto Star. “It’s one of them things that no matter how indestructible we look like we are, we’re all human at the end of the day,” DeRozan explained. “We all got feelings … all of that. Sometimes … it gets the best of you, there’s times everything in the whole world’s on top of you.”</p>\n<p>This interview came on the heels of a tweet which DeRozan sent out in February that simply read “This depression get the best of me…” and sparked a national dialogue around how society stigmatizes and stifles mental health awareness among male athletes. Cavaliers forward Kevin Love expanded on this conversation in a piece he penned for the Players’ Tribune, in which he pointed out that “These values about men and toughness are so ordinary that they’re everywhere . . . and invisible at the same time, surrounding us like air or water.”</p>\n<p>There are two especially important points that DeRozan and Love made in their statements, and both offer solutions to deal with the issues surrounding mental health education. The first is that anyone at any time can be affected by some sort of mental illness, although it is important to note that there are very important outside factors (degree of illness, race, gender identity, economic status) which affect both the support for and impact of these problems. The second is that there is a very specific socialization of men, by men, that occurs in the United States, which manifests itself into toxic ideologies and actions for men ourselves and the communities we inhabit.</p>\n<p>It goes without saying that in order to start working on the issues of misrepresentation and miseducation when it comes to mental health, there has to be acknowledgment that there are problems in the first place. This is why it was important to hear not just an NBA player, but a Black NBA player, come out and address a topic like depression.</p>\n<p>Centuries of oppression, whether it be through the restriction of access to medical knowledge and care or the dehumanization and desensitization of Black and brown suffering, has created extreme stigma within communities of color surrounding mental health. Black Americans are more likely to undergo feelings of depression and worthlessness than white Americans, and yet, according to Mental Health America, have less access to treatment and actually utilize help at far lower rates.</p>\n<p>It would be far simpler to address these statistics if it was simply a matter of outward exclusion; however, internal attitudes ingrained over the years complicate accessibility as well. Because of historical precedents such as the Tuskegee Syphilis experiment or contemporary exclusion from groups such as the American Psychological Organization (of which Black Americans only make up 2 percent), there has been a cultural isolation of Black and brown communities from the medical community, which in turn has led to the solidification of negative and inaccurate ideologies.</p>\n<p>The characterization of mental illness as “weakness” or as in opposition to masculinity is very prevalent within these communities and has a tangible impact, such as the marginally higher attempted suicide rates among young Black boys compared to white children. By exposing his own fragility, DeRozan has helped counter this and start toward creating an atmosphere where Black and brown children are believed and supported.</p>\n<p>It is important to note, however, that it is men who have to take on most of the burden of unlearning and working toward less stigmatization of mental illness. As we have seen with recent mass school shootings, as well as the well-documented history of male violence in this country, our conception of masculinity or “manhood” is just not healthy. Entitlement and over-confidence combined with a lack of empathy for others might work sometimes on the basketball court, but is a disastrous approach to relationships in other aspects of life.</p>\n<p>The truth is, for women and queer folks of color, most danger and abuse does not come from outside, but rather from straight men of color in their own communities. While all people of color have to deal with racism, stigma surrounding mental illness and lack of accessibility in other aspects of life, it is somehow acceptable to use violence against Black and brown women as an outlet for male frustration and inadequacy. This is a problem for all men, yet one would hope that having to deal with an intersection of other oppressions would give Black and brown men a better understanding of how not to channel their problems into “punching down.” Only once we are able to protect those who are most vulnerable will we be able to attack the institutions or figures in power which are the crux of the problem.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, sports both reflect and create culture. Athletes such as DeRozan and Love speaking up about their own struggles with mental health mirrors a recent illumination of the topic in popular discourse; however, toxic ideals surrounding masculinity in sports have also been ingrained into American society for years. It is up to men to change how we talk and think about mental health, for our well-being and everyone else’s safety.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 24</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

in comparison to the other Big West Conference opponents, UCSB is ranked second overall in the standings, only a pair of wins behind UC Irvine who have played two more games than the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>As for the hosting Rice Owls, they’ll want to pick up the pace as their 4-6 overall record has proven subpar. They will, however, be coming off their most recent victory against a St. Edward’s side, which ended in favor of the hosts by a final score of 78-73.</p>\n<p>Although, before that win the Owls were on a four-game losing streak that they’ll want to forget about as soon as possible. In terms of conference standings, under Conference USA, they find themselves in the bottom third overall.</p>\n<p>Historically speaking, UCSB has faced Rice two times in the program’s past, and have never dropped a game in that time; with their last meeting occurring back in 1973. Away games are always tricky to speculate on, but the Gauchos will look to continue their winning ways and maintain their undefeated status over the Owls.</p>\n<p>Defense has been the main point of emphasis for this Gauchos side in recent weeks, and it has definitely paid off. However, following the most recent UAPB match, the team will want to limit turnovers as much as possible and capitalize on scoring opportunities as they come.</p>\n<p>In terms of players to watch for the Gauchos, two guards have now passed the 100-point mark this far through the season. First, graduate Ar’mond Davis leads his side in scoring with a total of 129 points on the year. Sophomore JaQuori McLaughlin, who is first in minutes played for UCSB, is second in scoring with a total of 100 flat to his name. Speaking of sophomore guards, Devearl Ramsey continues to shine in his playmaker role, in Max Heidegger’s absence; Ramsey is tied, with McLaughlin, for leading UCSB in assists, with a total 34 already.</p>\n<p>On the opposition’s end, the Gauchos will have to deal with four different scorers who have all surpassed the 100-point mark for the Owls. Leading in scoring is Rice’s junior guard, Ako Adams, who has made 124 total points; Adams also leads his side in playmaking with 33 assists so far through the season. Graduate forward Jack Williams will be another key player that the Gauchos will have to contend against on both sides of the court.</p>\n<p>At 6’8”, Williams was one of those four plus 100-point scorers, with 106 to his name, and he is also the Owls’ leading rim protector; the big man boasts 73 total rebounds, 17 of which were on offensive and the remaining 56 on defense.</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel to Tudor Fieldhouse, in Houston, Texas, for their matchup against Rice University. Tipoff off time is this Saturday, December 15, at 12 PM noon.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Max Heidegger made his long-anticipated season debut in Houston, Texas on Saturday as the UCSB men’s basketball team held off the Rice University Owls in a 99-89 overtime thriller.</p>\n<p>Although questions arose about how the star guard would insert himself back into the Gauchos rotation, Heidegger’s return to the attack was as smooth as the Gauchos three-point stroke from deep. UCSB knocked down 48.6% of perimeter shots as they opened the game on a 12-0 run from four straight triples including two that came from sophomore Jaquori Mclaughlin.</p>\n<p>Mclaughlin finished with 22 points while shooting 7-10 on field goals. He hit on a game-high 6-8 from three in addition to tallying four assists in the process. His starting backcourt counterpart sophomore Devearl Ramsey was magnificent leading the Gaucho’s attack in crunch time, as he added 8 points right off the bat in overtime en route to a career-high 21-point night with five three pointers.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“[Devearl] had 3 assists and one turnover. All I care about is don’t turn the ball over,” chimed Head Coach Joe Pasternack after the game. “We get him to go 5-7 from three… that’s a bonus, that’s huge. We needed every single one of them.”</p>\n<p>Down 12 points within the first 2 minutes to open the game, the Owls clawed back and took command with a 31-7 stretch to put Rice up 31-19 with 4:21 to play in the first half. The scoring stretch was capped off by a three-point play by freshman guard Chris Mullins who added 21 points in 40 minutes for the Owls and while going 6-16 from the field.</p>\n<p>Each team traded jumpers as the half ticked to a close with Rice up by 10 in the final second. With just a flash of time on the clock, Heidegger muscled the ball past the timeline and drew a shooting foul from three with just .1 seconds left. The Oaks Christian High School product sunk all three free-throws and moved the Gauchos within 7, down 39-32 at the break.</p>\n<p>Heidegger immediately assumed a quarterback role in the attack whenever he came on the floor. In his return, the preseason first team All-Big West Conference honoree added 22 points in 29 minutes off of the bench while shooting 6-16 from the field.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho’s offense lit up at the start of the half as they opened up on a 13-2 scoring run in which Devearl Ramsey and Heidegger collaborated for 11 of 13 out of the gate in the second half.</p>\n<p>Just minutes after entering the half off the bench, Heidegger put an exclamation mark on the Gauchos opening push when he connected with consecutive threes as he launched the latter from over 35-feet out to put UCSB on top for the first time since the 11-minute mark in the first half.</p>\n<p>Following a trio of free-throws from graduate guard Armond Davis with 13:16 on the clock, the momentum had officially shifted as the visiting Gaucho’s had now taken a 50-45 lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB silenced the crowd with its suffocating defense on the ensuing possession which forced a telegraphed pass from freshman guard Trey Murphy III. Just in front of the midline, senior forward Jarriesse Blackmon jumped in front of Murphy’s feed and finished with a flush in transition on the other end.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos continued their offensive production spearheaded by the Mclaughlin-Heidegger attack in the second half, Chris Mullins and junior Robert Martin finished with 10 and 11 points respectively to set the scene for a last-ditch comeback in the final 4 minutes.</p>\n<p>Following a quick release trey from Mclaughlin with 3:41 left on the clock, the Owls finished off regulation with a 9-2 run that sent the Saturday matinee matchup into overtime at 77-77.</p>\n<p>Devearl Ramsey took matters into his own hands as the game made its way into extra time. Ramsey dazzled by adding 8 points in the first minute and a half as he splashed two from downtown along with a driving teardrop at the rack to put UCSB up 87-82.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos carried their lead to the finish line as they went 10-10 from the stripe in overtime to close out the thriller. SB hit 23 of 24 free throws compared to the Owls who went 18-34 from the line.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter who you’re playing; the same things matter. Do you hit your free throws on the road? In Washington we didn’t. Here we went 23 of 24 from the free throw line,” said Coach Pasternack. “You can’t turn the ball over on the road and we had nine turnovers; one of our best performances of the year.”</p>\n<p>Five Gauchos finished in double-digits with Heidegger, Mclaughlin, and Devearl Ramsey all ending the night with more than 20 points. Armond Davis joined in with 10 while freshman forward Amadou Sow went a perfect 6-6 from the field on his way to a 12-point night.</p>\n<p>The ‘Chos away game at Rice was Santa Barbara’s penultimate non-conference road game as they head to Omaha, Nebraska to take on University of Nebraska Omaha at the Baxter Arena on Wednesday, December 19 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85392\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-17/ramsey-dazzles-in-overtime-as-gauchos-win-in-heideggers-return/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85392\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-17/ramsey-dazzles-in-overtime-as-gauchos-win-in-heideggers-return/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-17/ramsey-dazzles-in-overtime-as-gauchos-win-in-heideggers-return/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-17/ramsey-dazzles-in-overtime-as-gauchos-win-in-heideggers-return/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-17/ramsey-dazzles-in-overtime-as-gauchos-win-in-heideggers-return/","id":1041,"author":{"id":36,"name":"Max Kelton"},"related":[1040,1039,1038],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
