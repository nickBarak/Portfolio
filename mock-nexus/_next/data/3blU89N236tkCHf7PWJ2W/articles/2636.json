Each speaker will present an individual topic about the struggles and successes relating to recovery. Sponsors will offer resources and information to students, with organizers anticipating attendees from across the UC and out of state.</p>\n<p>UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program counselor and recovery specialist Angie Bryan said the conference can help break down preconceptions about the recovery process while creating a community for recovering students.</p>\n<p>“One goal is to bring students together in recovery just for fellowship and mutual support,” Bryan said. “We’re trying to promote awareness about being in recovery, and that people in recovery are assets to a college community … to reduce the stigma about being in recovery in college.”</p>\n<p>Bryan said the recovery movement began at UCSB four years ago with the assistance of UC Riverside and has grown into a UC-wide program for addiction recovery.</p>\n<p>“I think initially the goal was to help start the movement in California,” Bryan said. “Four years ago, we were just starting our program here and Riverside had a student group, but there wasn’t else much happening in our state. Now we have collegiate recovery programs at most of the UCs.”</p>\n<p>Second-year psychology major and recovery intern for Gauchos for Recovery Adam Daar said UC Riverside supports UCSB in hosting the event.</p>\n<p>“UC Riverside wanted to keep it student led, and I think that people liked the idea of bringing it to Santa Barbara because they saw that we had a strong collegiate recovery program community already,” Daar said. “We are really happy to be able to do this.”</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year global studies major and recovery intern for Gauchos for Recovery Emily Bills, recovery programs have been growing rapidly in recent years and UCSB has one of the best programs to host the conference.</p>\n<p>“There are only so many recovery programs in California that are able to host. We have a huge support from the Alcohol and Drug Program that no other schools really have,” Bills said.</p>\n<p>According to Director of UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program Jackie Kurta, the process of recovery will be destigmatized throughout the conference. Kurta said she hopes this will lead to more acknowledgement and support for recovering students.</p>\n<p>“I think there are assumptions made about how college students lead their lives,” Kurta said. “There’s stigma about people being in recovery or students who were struggling and not yet able to make a choice that is working well for them. I think our community needs to be more sensitive to being helpful and supportive and not being judging and off-putting in that way.”</p>\n<p>Kurta said the conference will also showcase UCSB’s efforts to improve the lives of students dealing with addiction and recovery.</p>\n<p>“We all saw it as a terrific opportunity to bring attention to the work that is being done and to applaud the efforts of the program and to bring some recognition to our campus, because people don’t always think of UCSB and sober living,” Kurta said. “It was an opportunity to say we have a thriving program, we have a very diverse community and our community can include students in recovery.”</p>\n<p>Daar said he hopes the conference can help unify colleges and create diverse alcohol and drug programs at different universities.</p>\n<p>“I think something the conference can do is [help] other schools with their recovery program and learn about our own and cultivate a space of learning … and expand the national recovery movement, especially on college campuses,” Daar said.</p>\n<p>Daar said all students and UCSB staff are welcome to attend the conference and can volunteer for the event to learn about recovery.</p>\n<p>“They can reach out to us and sign up for volunteer shifts,” Daar said. “They get free admission and are welcome to help out and attend the entire conference — they get all the information that is really guided for students.”</p>\n<p>Daar said if students are struggling with an addiction they should seek help and know that recovery teams are there for support.</p>\n<p>“Try really hard to not be afraid to ask for help. Know that no one in this recovery community is going to judge you for asking for help,” Daar said. “They can come to us to ask for help and they will be welcomed with open arms. I want them to know that.”</p>\n<p>Bryan said the resources offered at the conference can be of help to anyone affected by addiction.</p>\n<p>“I just want to emphasize that everybody is touched by addiction in some way, whether it’s personally or [through] a friend or family member,” Bryan said. “I think that anyone could get something out of the conference.”</p>\n<p>The Alcohol and Drug Program offers weekly meetings open to all community members and hosts quarterly events. Services are primarily free to all students, including resources for being an ally in recovery.</p>\n<p>For more information about the conference and registration, visit

Lingerie,” describing the post-9/11 lives of six Pakistani-American Muslim women Friday at 8 p.m. at the MCC Theater.</p>\n<p>Fatima’s play intertwines sex, politics and religion as the six women discuss their lives during a heavily Islamophobic time in America while drying their lingerie. The play aims to dispel stereotypes of Muslim culture and women.</p>\n<p>MCC Programmer Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said the event represents ideals the MCC aims to promote.</p>\n<p>“This play was really hot — up and coming,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “It fit within the narrative and algorithm that the MCC uses, that intersection of diversity, relativity and being current.”</p>\n<p>Mohsenian-Rahman said the purpose of the show is to educate UCSB students about the often negatively portrayed culture of Pakistani women.</p>\n<p>“There is such a heightened sense of Islamophobia and aggression towards anyone in proximity to that faith in this country that I think anything that you can utilize to cut down at that kind of aggression is beneficial,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “I think that a play like this might hit the mark for some in breaking down those barriers, and perhaps not for others.”</p>\n<p>Muslim Student Association (MSA) member and third-year CCS literature major Heeba Kaleem said because Fatima is Muslim, her performance will offer an accurate perspective on what it is like to be stereotyped.</p>\n<p>“It’s not just someone who doesn’t know anything about Muslim culture or may have stereotypical understandings of what being a Muslim in America is like, so I’m happy there’s some kind of story being told,” Kaleem said.</p>\n<p>MSA member and third-year economics and math major Nihal Hakim said he thought the title of the play is offensive to Pakistani people.</p>\n<p>“At first when I saw the event name, “Dirty Paki Lingerie,” my first hang up was on just the name, or the use of the word Paki,” Hakim said. “Paki is a racial slur, especially in the UK, but also to a certain degree in the U.S. It’s a word that really brings down a whole community of people.”</p>\n<p>Hakim said the image on flyers for the event of Fatima holding piece of lingerie while wearing a hijab is a false image of what it is like to be a Pakistani woman.</p>\n<p>“It relies on the stereotypes of the Muslim woman — the Pakistani woman — being somewhat different and that difference being an oppression and that oppression can only be alleviated by a very specific type of post-colonial westernization,” Hakim said.</p>\n<p>Mohsenian-Rahman said she encourages people to watch the show with an open mind despite the backlash from students and alumni.</p>\n<p>“I would encourage them to think twice and come to the event to think about what the ultimate goals of the play really are,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “It’s not necessarily perpetuation; she’s not trying to participate in stereotyping ourselves or themselves or yourselves, she’s trying to combat them.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Bearman also held a Q&amp;A session and signed copies of his most recent book, Drugs Are NOT the Devil’s Tools.  Bearman was a key founder of the Isla Vista Neighborhood Clinic in 1970 and Director of Medical Services for the Santa Barbara Regional Health Authority (SBRHA) for 17 years.</p>\n<p>Bearman began with a 45-minute lecture on the history of  drug consumption,  beginning with Zoroastrian rituals and ending with GW Pharmaceuticals’ 2014 medical trials of Epidiolex, a liquid form of Cannabidiol used to treat epilepsy.</p>\n<p>Bearman said the history of cannabis use can help people understand modern policy and culture surrounding the drug.</p>\n<p>“The reason that history is important is it helps explain why we have this peculiar attitude towards this substance that has a tremendous amount of healing potential,” Bearman said.</p>\n<p>According to Bearman, drug policy in the past has discriminated against African-American, Latino, Chinese, Native American and Irish minority groups, as well as many others.</p>\n<p>Bearman said the word “witch-hunt” stems from Pope Innocent VIII’s Summis desiderantes affectibus in 1484. According to Bearman, the issuance sought to punish midwives (witches) for their use of cannabis to dull childbirth pains, since Church doctrine viewed this practice as heretical.</p>\n<p>“One of the first groups that was discriminated against was where we get the word ‘witch-hunt’ from,” Bearman said. “Witches were midwives and used cannabis to ease the pain of childbirth.”</p>\n<p>Bearman later said hemp was the “oil of the 16th century” due to its use in trans-Atlantic ships’ “sails and rigging,” including those used in the slave trade.<br>\n“Those boats were used for the triangular trade, both sugar, rum and slavery,” said Bearman.</p>\n<p>Bearman said the Founding Fathers, including George Washington, were especially fond of hemp and grew the plant.</p>\n<p>“Washington wrote in his diary that he so hoped he’d get home in time for the hemp harvest since he so particularly enjoyed being there for the burning of the slag,” Bearman said.</p>\n<p>After providing a broad history of drug use, Bearman shifted his focus to the history of cannabis in Western medicine, crediting Dr. Brooke O’Shaughnessy with first reintroducing cannabis to the Western world.</p>\n<p>“Dr. Brooke O’Shaughnessy had been in India, where they’d been using cannabis for at least 3,000 years,” Bearman said. “They’re still using cannabis in India, at least by the poor, as a medicine.”</p>\n<p>After O’Shaughnessy reintroduced cannabis to western medicine, it quickly gained broad popularity with almost 2.5 million doctor’s prescriptions filled in 1928.</p>\n<p>Bearman said the wide use of cannabis as a legal medicine quickly changed due to policies enacted in 1930 by commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics Harry J. Anslinger, serving cotton and nylon corporations’ interests.</p>\n<p>“He was the greatest bureaucrat of all time because he created a problem where it didn’t exist and thus increased his bureaucracy,” Bearman said. “The effort had really nothing to do with marginalizing marijuana — they were aimed at marginalizing hemp.”</p>\n<p>Bearman ended by discussing contemporary medical studies on cannabis and the endocannabinoid system as well as discussing what he calls the “New Paradigm” — the viewpoint that substance abuse should be treated as a medical condition instead of through the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p>“The first modern research on cannabis was having to do with seizures in 1949,” Bearman said. “Cannabis is immensely helpful for cancer patients and in fact it may kill cancer cells.”</p>\n<p>Bearman answered a range of questions, including how cannabis affects driving, “big tobacco’s” possible future role in cannabis production and how a change in drug scheduling would affect cannabis research.</p>\n<p>“What the Department of Transportation says is there’s no relationship between impairment and the level of THC,” Bearman said.</p>\n<p>Bearman said the role of “big tobacco” in marijuana legalization would have a negative effect.</p>\n<p>“I think the odds are 100 percent and it’s bad,” Bearman said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara resident Jarryd Wafer said he enjoyed the talk and was very interested in cannabis’s potential to treat his type I diabetes.</p>\n<p>“I thought it was great learning about the histories associated, where we’re at today and where we’re going with cannabis,” Wafer said.</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Tara Cseresynyac, who works as Dr. Bearman’s personal assistant, said she was happy about the turnout and is looking forward to future lectures.</p>\n<p>“I was impressed by the turn out; I thought there was a great variety of people,” Cseresynyac said. “There were students, professionals — a huge variety of people.”</p>\n<p>In an interview following the lecture, Bearman said he would be open to giving another talk on campus and said he would like to see broader teaching of the endocannabinoid system at universities.</p>\n<p>“I was very pleased with the turnout. I think people were interested — people stuck around, asked good questions and were interested in the information,” Bearman said. “I’d like to see UCSB have a course on the endocannabinoid system.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of the Thursday, November 5, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66163\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/dr-david-bearman-talks-history-uses-of-cannabis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66163\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/dr-david-bearman-talks-history-uses-of-cannabis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/dr-david-bearman-talks-history-uses-of-cannabis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/dr-david-bearman-talks-history-uses-of-cannabis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/dr-david-bearman-talks-history-uses-of-cannabis/","id":2633,"author":{"id":133,"name":"Duncan Calvert"},"related":[2632,2631,2630],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
