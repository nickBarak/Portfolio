Six applicants will then be selected after applications close on June 1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lisa Klock, the process innovation program manager of the College of Letters &amp; Science Information Technology (I.T.) department, explained that a visit to Westmont College in Santa Barbara served as a major catalyst for the internships. In observing Westmont I.T. interns, she noted that “it [was] extraordinary what the students are capable of” as they worked alongside faculty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klock stressed that UCSB’s internships are open to anyone “who’s really wanting this” and that they’re “not just looking for the coder.” All majors, she said — including humanities and social sciences majors — who demonstrate creativity, motivation and “a desire to learn something new” are welcome to apply.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Explore, dream and discover,” Klock summarized. “Coding can be taught.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although interns will be positioned in different departments and will be working with different sets of software, Klock said that students will still meet regularly to share their progress, talk about their experiences and present their work to administrators. The objective is to foster a sense of camaraderie among all six interns and prepare them for the “real world,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chief among the program’s considerations, Klock said, is to increase student involvement on campus and to “keep these students working for the UC and inside the UC family.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We only have what is known as ‘one deep’ structures in many of our IT operations,” Matthew Hall, associate vice chancellor for I.T. and chief information officer of UCSB, said in an email. “If a person leaves, it leaves a skills and capabilities gap.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The solution is to “immerse students in I.T. culture,” Klock said. That involves having undergraduates with full administrative privileges directly creating and editing the school’s digital infrastructure, she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a win-win,” Hall said. “Employers benefit by lowering the burden of on-boarding well-qualified candidates. And the interns are equipped with practical skill in a high demand field.” Another benefit, he said, would come in the form of “a potential pool of future employees” for the UC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, the coronavirus put a wrench in the internship plans, but staff members adapted the internship training in order to keep them on pace with the original schedule.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The pandemic struck the same month we sent out the application,” Rebecca Carroll, the technical project manager at Enterprise Technology Services, said. As a result, the I.T. department was forced to adapt the program relatively quickly during its shift to working remotely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carroll explained that internship training will be conducted throughout the summer, through either Zoom meetings or all-expenses-paid online courses like LinkedIn Learning, Pluralsight and the UCSB Learning Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For interns who may not have ready access to a device of their own, Carroll said, the department will provide them with laptops, with all of the necessary software pre-installed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Come fall quarter, Klock hopes that students will be able to physically work at the offices on campus “once everything opens up again.” In the meantime, she said her priorities include clear communication and assignments for interns and making sure that “the student is happy in their needs.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The results from this year’s pilot internships will inform the next year’s, Klock said, and in the coming years, her goal is to expand the program across the entire UC system.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

id=\"caption-attachment-94020\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Lea Toubian</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus believes that Toubian’s experiences working as a senator and with local campaigns in I.V., in addition to her specific goals if elected, have lent Toubian an advantage over her opponent, Yasamin Salari, who is running with the Isla Vista Party. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, that is not to say that Salari would not do well in the position — while Toubian has the edge, we believe that both candidates are incredibly qualified to serve as External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA). Our campus would be in good hands regardless of who is elected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian’s platform focuses on increasing the I.V. community’s access to its local government and addressing student needs in times of crisis, which includes creating a cohesive emergency response plan that involves the university, the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and other organizations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Toubian aims to increase voter registration among both students and I.V. residents, develop proactive responses to sexual assault in I.V., hold landlords accountable for cliff erosion in I.V. and continue environmental projects such as the I.V. Compost Collective.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the Nexus does doubt the feasibility of Toubian’s goal to hold landlords accountable in addressing cliff erosion during her term as EVPLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian’s involvement with Campus Democrats her freshman year allowed her to embed herself in the community and foster personal connections with the I.V. CSD. She also worked as the external director of Associated Students Lobby Corps and was involved in the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Measure R campaign</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which secured funding for the I.V. CSD in 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her sophomore year, Toubian served as both an on-campus senator and as the secretary of Campus Democrats. After she returned from studying abroad this year, she took a position as the chief of staff for current Internal Vice President Alli Adam. Toubian believes that her time working with the Senate has prepared her for the role of EVPLA, despite not having worked directly with the office before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had to learn a lot about the communities that exist at UCSB. I had to learn about how to listen and uplift other people’s voices instead of putting mine ahead of them,” Toubian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Instead of imparting my own biases on someone or a group of people, instead of speaking on behalf of people, [I learned] how to be the representative and actually uplift their voices using the platform that you’re given.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By working as chief of staff for Adam, Toubian said the position, along with her involvement in Campus Democrats, allowed her to stay connected with various groups on and off campus. Pulling from her experiences from Campus Democrats, she also sees voter registration for the upcoming November election as a priority for the office.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian also identified various issues around campus that she would like to address using the full power of the EVPLA office, including food insecurity, housing issues and sexual assault in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The benefit of having an office under you is that you could also specifically delegate people to make one issue or a small handful of issues their priority, which I think is a lot more effective than having one person try to tackle and say that they’re going to tackle every single issue,” Toubian said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re each able to tackle and be the spearheads for each issue and they can become experts on the topic. There are people who are passionate and most importantly, they’re people who have relevant experiences with that [issue],” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian also hopes to expand access to resources by widening normal outreach through Facebook and door-to-door canvassing, particularly for the non-student population in I.V., by providing translation services for non-English speakers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though Toubian is receiving our endorsement, the Nexus believes that Salari would also do well in the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salari served as an on-campus senator on the 69th Senate but </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-26/judicial-council-unanimously-votes-to-remove-a-s-senator-salari/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was removed in Winter Quarter 2018</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for violating the eligibility requirement for the position, which states that on-campus senators must live amongst their constituents. In her interview with the Nexus, Salari cited financial issues as the reason she moved off campus and said that her work in the EVPLA office over the past few months inspired her to run for the position of EVPLA and improve it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salari’s platform focuses on expanding on the university’s timely warning system to include any incidents of violence in I.V., not just on campus-associated property. She said she also hopes to work with Students Against Sexual Assault, Take Back the Night, the Title IX office and the Interfraternity Council to establish monthly meetings to assess the campus’ sexual assault climate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Toubian is well-versed in the I.V. CSD’s structure and its work, Salari had more tangible experience than Toubian in working directly with the I.V. CSD, as she currently serves as the I.V. CSD coordinator in the EVPLA office under Christian Ornelas. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through this role, she became familiar with the projects of past EVPLAs, such as the police collaborative board, to address safety issues between students and police, a project she hopes to continue. It was also clear that she is knowledgeable about the various entities that the EVPLA and the I.V. CSD work closely with and has working relationships with many of them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salari also wants to provide a direct bus shuttle between I.V. and Camino Real Marketplace for students to acquire essential groceries, but she was not able to provide a tangible plan or distinguish why her plan was different from the bus lines already in place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also recognized the importance of groups in I.V. besides students, such as the houseless population and families, and wants to work to establish a line of communication through the EVPLA office to learn more about non-student populations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout her interview, it was clear that Salari was the candidate who had her ear to the ground in I.V. and on campus and would likely raise more awareness of the EVPLA office among students and student groups. Toubian, whose experience was more political, would benefit from Salari’s student-oriented approach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Nexus believes that Toubian’s experience lends her to be a better fit for the position of EVPLA, we acknowledge that both candidates’ work and familiarity with the office and I.V. speak to their qualifications for the job.</span></p>\n<p><em>Update: The Nexus has replaced the portraits done of each candidate with their self-submitted headshot. We heard concerns about the portraits not accurately reflecting what the candidates look like and will actively work to ensure that this will not happen in the future.</em></p><div

2018, and the three-goal comeback against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the Champions League last year. Those were certainly nice moments. But they never felt indicative of broader success; rather, they felt lucky. United fans were happy we finished second because, frankly, we didn’t deserve to (thank you, David de Gea). United fans were happy we came back against PSG because we knew we lacked the quality to compete with a team of that caliber — something United proved when they flamed out in the next round against Barcelona.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But on Wednesday, when Manchester United dismantled Sheffield United 3-0, I felt hope.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I say dismantled because, well, the 3-0 scoreline doesn’t do justice to the performance. After two early goals, Manchester United was content to maintain possession, forcing the Blades to chase the ball around for most of the second half. The Red Devils kept 68% possession on Wednesday, while outshooting Sheffield United 13-4.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be transparent, it was a lackluster performance from Sheffield United, who have looked less-than-stellar since the restart. While the Blades still sit in an impressive eighth place, they’ve looked much more like the newly promoted side they are in recent times, rather than the team that was pushing to qualify for the Champions League back in March.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Wednesday’s performance was bigger than gaudy stats, bigger than an underwhelming opponent. No, Wednesday’s performance was a blueprint to future success for Manchester United.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since Manchester United acquired creative maestor Bruno Fernandes in January, pundits and fans alike have wondered how Fernandes could coexist with star French international Paul Pogba, who had spent most of the season on the sidelines with an ankle injury. In February and March — without Pogba — Fernandes displayed his quality, racking up 4 goals and 3 assists as an attacking midfielder. Fernandes’ ability to play a killer pass, as well as his lethal long-range shot, allowed Manchester United to better break down opponents playing a low defensive block.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a healthy Pogba, however, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had to devise a plan in which the two could play together. While both offer creativity and quality going forward, both also oftentimes struggle on the defensive end. Many pundits speculated that playing both together would cause problems for United’s back four.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it remains to be seen how the two perform together against a top opponent, Wednesday’s performance should help disprove that theory. Solskjaer employed Pogba as a deep-lying playmaker, which enabled him to control the pace of the game while still providing cover for the back line. Although not quite as dangerous going forward as he usually is, Pogba still had the ability to play dangerous through balls — which he successfully did throughout the game. Meanwhile, Fernandes operated in his favored attacking midfielder role, linking up with Pogba and the front three on multiple occasions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, Solskjaer utilized veteran midfielder Nemanja Matic as a holding midfielder who acted as the glue that kept the entire formation functional. There’s no doubt that the 31-year-old has lost a step in recent years; with Pogba and Fernandes ahead of him on the pitch, however, they don’t need his pace. Instead, Matic operated just in front of the full-backs, sniffing out any counterattacking chances that Sheffield United had when Pogba opted to move up the pitch into the attacking third.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be clear, Manchester United wasn’t flawless on Wednesday. Marcus Rashford — Manchester United’s top goal scorer this season — missed a few easy chances, although his passing was pristine. The Red Devils still desperately need a right winger: Mason Greenwood is great, but he’s a far better second-striker than winger. The backline of Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof — as solid as it’s been this season — still struggled against pacy counterattacks. And striker Anthony Martial won’t be able to score a hat trick every game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Manchester United wants to challenge for the title next season instead of fighting for a Champions League berth, it will need to improve on all of these fronts while renewing the contract of Pogba.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For the first time in recent memory, however, there’s a clear path ahead for Manchester United. It may not be much, but after everything that has gone wrong in the past seven years for the Red Devils, it’s a welcome start.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

400;\">For more than a month, soccer fans have clung desperately to any semblance of soccer. The Belarusian Premier League — which has unwisely kept playing in the wake of COVID-19 — has drawn record-breaking viewership numbers. I myself was so desperate for sporting content that I sat through an entire FIFA match between England internationals Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford (spoiler: their FIFA skills are far inferior to their real-life skills). With no end in sight, I’ve had to get my soccer fix through patchy World Cup highlight videos, Instagram Live and copious amounts of Football Manager 2020. Needless to say, it’s been rough.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But finally, there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. Yesterday, two German minister presidents — Markus S</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">öder </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and Armin Laschet  — expressed optimism that the </span><a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/germany-bundesliga-return-to-action-on-may-9-definitely-possible/a-53193629\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bundesliga could return May 9</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While the official date will be decided later next week, it likely won’t vary far from this May 9 date. Germany has been coordinated and efficient in their COVID-19 response, and just recently started opening up the country. With a plethora of tests at their disposal, playing the Bundesliga behind closed doors in the near future seems both pragmatic and possible.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those of you thinking “Great, soccer is back, but who cares about the Bundesliga!?,” well, evidently we all do now. In case you didn’t care previously, though, here’s a short guide on the league to catch you up to date and help you prepare mentally for the return.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/roblew.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1353438342\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"94075\"> </a></p>\n<p><b>Can Anyone Catch Bayern?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With nine games left in the season, perennial juggernaut Bayern Munich leads the table, four points clear of second place Borussia Dortmund and five points clear of RB Leipzig. Remarkably, Bayern is seeking their eighth consecutive Bundesliga title, although of late the Baverian giants have appeared far more mortal than in the past. Bayern sacked their previous manager, Niko </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kovač,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in early November after a tumultuous start to the season, but under new manager Hansi Flick, the club hasn’t lost any competitions since December 7. Bayern’s success this year rests squarely on the shoulders of 31-year-old Polish striker Robert Lewandowski, who has bagged a remarkable 25 goals in only 23 games played. Defensively, Bayern is as solid as ever, led by Manuel Neuer — who seems to have rediscovered his form this season. Still, Bayern has proven their vulnerability this season, especially when Lewandowksi doesn’t find the back of the net. With an away match at Dortmund remaining, the league is anything but finished.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/roblew.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1353438342\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"94075\"> </a></p>\n<p><b>Dortmund: The Inconsistent Challengers</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last time the world saw Dortmund play, the Western German side blew a 2-1 aggregate lead to Paris Saint-Germain in the second leg of their Champions League fixture. That about sums up this Dortmund side: limitless potential, but with youth and a defense that has been shockingly leaky for a team with title ambitions. Since signing Erling Braut Haaland in the winter transfer window, Dortmund has featured one of the most lethal attacks in all of soccer. Already, the 19-year-old wunderkind has bagged nine goals for the German side, while 20-year-old Sancho has used his pace and technique on the wing to contribute 14 goals and 16 assists. With established German internationals Mats Hummels and Marco Reus in the side, talent has never been the issue. Consistency, on the other hand, has often plagued Dortmund, like in their 4-3 loss to Bayer Leverkusen in February. While the odds remain against Dortmund, don’t count out one of the most explosive teams in Europe.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/roblew.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1353438342\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"94075\"> </a></p>\n<p><b>RB Leipzig: The Early Bloomers </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a seemingly less realistic pick to win the Bundesliga, Leipzig sit only 5 points back of Bayern for first place and 1 point back of Dortmund for second place. After a torrid start to the season, Leipzig have cooled off considerably, with draws in their last two league games. Nevertheless, this side showed the world what it can do when it dismantled Tottenham Hotspur 4-0 on aggregate in the Champions League. Star forward Timo Werner leads the front line with 21 goals in 25 games, and Austrian international Marcel Sabitzer has proved to be an admirable secondary option with 8 goals and 6 assists in the league so far. Having already played Bayern twice this season, however, it will take a collapse from the Bavarian giants for Leipzig to swoop in for the title.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/roblew.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1353438342\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"94075\"> </a></p>\n<p><b>The Others: Borussia M</b><b>ö</b><b>nchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It remains unlikely that either of these teams will win the title: Borussia Mönchengladbach sits 6 points back of Bayern and Bayer Leverkusen sits 8 points back of the leaders. However, both these teams play Bayern again this season, and therefore will play a crucial role in determining the champion. In addition, these two teams are vying against one another for the fourth and final Champions League qualification spot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By most metrics, Mönchengladbach have significantly overachieved this season. Led by Swiss international keeper Yann Sommer, Mönchengladbach’s back line has been pivotal in their success this season. While Mönchengladbach lacks the star quality of their rivals, their attack has proved to be efficient, with French forward Alassane </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pléa</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> leading the team with 8 goals in 22 games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the flip side, Bayer Leverkusen has an abundance of talent, but have yet to fully put together the performances the side is capable of. Midfielder Kai Havertz is one of the premier talents in the league, and has put together solid performance after solid performance in what is almost assuredly his final season for the side. Elsewhere, veteran Karim Bellarabi continues to shine, while 22-year-old Leon Bailey has shown glimpses of his massive potential. An injury to leading goal scorer Kevin Volland significantly dampers the potential of this team, but there are still enough pieces to vy for fourth place.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.
