What the hell are we doing?” he asked.</p>\n<p>Joe Biden was the vice president under the Obama Administration from 2009 to 2017 and has played a vocal role opposing the Trump Administration since his departure from office.</p>\n<p>Biden encouraged students to remain hopeful about politics, even if they believe the current national climate is broken “beyond repair.”</p>\n<p>“The reason I’m so excited about the millennials is because you reached the same place my generation did in the mid-sixties,” he said. “There’s no damn reason your generation can’t [face what’s ahead].”</p>\n<p>The United States’ involvement in the Vietnam War and the turmoil of the Civil Rights Movement throughout the 1960’s provoked protests and riots throughout the nation and on college campuses, including student anti-war protests at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Biden spoke passionately about the recent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia and reminded the crowd that Americans must bring moral values back into the political system and reject the “phony nationalism” of white supremacists.</p>\n<p>He also criticized President Donald Trump’s response to the protests in Charlottesville.</p>\n<p>“The silence was deafening. Silence is complicity,” he said. “[Silence] emboldens the small number of sick people that are out there.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79251\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79251\" data-attachment-id=\"79251\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-24/biden-expresses-hope-for-the-future-through-students/al_joebiden-171021-dustinharris-02/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-79251\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-79251\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Biden began his night in front of a sold-out crowd at the Arlington Theatre in Santa Barbara. <em>Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB sociology professor Kum-Kum Bhavnani joined Biden onstage for the Q&amp;A portion at the end of the lecture. Biden and Bhavnani discussed gun control, race relations in the U.S. and Biden’s son Beau’s battle with brain cancer.</p>\n<p>Though he often became visibly uncomfortable and withdrawn, Biden spoke with eloquence of his great personal tragedies.

The week’s events aim to address the nature of institutionalized racism and its effect on society.</p>\n<p>Garza, current special projects director for the National Domestic Workers Alliance, will share her call-to-action against discrimination in the U.S. and urge individuals to join the fight for justice for all black lives.</p>\n<p>Garza will also be featured in a sustainability workshop at 12 p.m. Wednesday in the Associated Students (A.S.) Pardall Center to discuss student activism, strategizing and movement.</p>\n<p>The BLM movement started in 2012 after 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was posthumously put on trial for his own murder and the shooter, George Zimmerman, was acquitted of the murder charges.</p>\n<p>Martin’s death and Zimmerman’s acquisition sparked outrage across the country. Racial tension became the center of protests much like those in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 after Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed by then police officer Darren Wilson.</p>\n<p>These cases prompted grassroots community organizing like BLM in response to the rising number of police shootings across the country.</p>\n<p>The internet responded to the growing tensions with #BlackLivesMatter.</p>\n<p>Opal Tometi, Patrisse Cullors and Garza, the BLM founders, transformed the viral hashtag into a movement that is now a chapter-based national organization working for the validity of black life.</p>\n<p>According to their website, BLM strives to broaden the conversation around state violence to include all of the ways in which black people are intentionally left powerless at the hands of the state.</p>\n<p>“It was a response to the anti-Black racism that permeates our society and also, unfortunately, our movements,” wrote Garza in the “herstory” section of their website.</p>\n<p>Critics of the movement visited UCSB earlier this year and stirred controversy over free speech.</p>\n<p>Ben Shapiro, conservative political commentator and author, visited Campbell Hall in February for an event titled “The Regressive Left, ‘Social Justice’ and #BlackLivesMatter.” The lecture was previously entitled “Lies, Prejudice and Division: The Legacy of the #BLM Movement.”</p>\n<p>The event was preempted by a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-s-senate-approves-funding-for-ben-shapiro-event-after-six-hour-meeting/\">six-hour-long A.S.

Hechler said 48 percent of students within the UCs identify as “food insecure.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like our food bank is humbly tucked away in the UCen and no one really knows about it, but we serve about 1,200 students a week, and that’s unreal compared to others,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hechler said he was the only one at the UC Council of Presidents who was able to say their campus had a successful food bank. He said UCSB is “way ahead” of other campuses in fighting student food insecurities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones said that, aside from the food bank team, Hechler has “really pushed things forward to have things settled and made sure that the expansion happened.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also said the whole food bank team got together to fight for the expansion, and she hopes to see it completed before she graduates in June.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hopefully with the work that we’re doing, we can destigmatize the desire and need to get food aid when you need it,” Jones said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza, a UC San Diego alum, last came to UCSB nearly 10 years ago when she worked for the University of California Student Association.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Setting the tone for an intersectional conversation about social justice, Garza welcomed the full auditorium by asking the audience to acknowledge that they were standing on land once occupied by Chumash indigenous people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She then expressed her support for the list of demands from the Black Student Union, Black Student Engagement program and Black Resource Committee, which includes ensuring that black students make up more than 5 percent of the university’s student population.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also supported the idea to hire two full-time black psychologists on campus and spoke of the psychological effects of controversial speakers invited to the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Emotional wellness is important for everybody, not just black students,” she said, “but certainly in a campus environment, where I hear there was just a speaker here talking about the lies and division of Black Lives Matter.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Shapiro spoke at Campbell Hall in February for his event titled “Lies, Prejudice, and Division: The Legacy of the #BLM Movement,” which was later named “The Regressive Left, ‘Social Justice’ and #BlackLivesMatter.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said narratives of history impact our present and future. She said “this country is powered by the engine of amnesia” because historical aspects are often “conveniently” left out in conversation about BLM.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza went on to say that the nation has a history of racially prejudiced “laws, policies and practices,” which she said are “deliberately designed to rob some of power in favor of giving others power.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She noted that of the “two million people locked up … one million of those people” are African American. She said they are not incarcerated because they are “inherently criminal.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is not liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican; this is just what is,” she said. “It’s because there are laws that disproportionately target black people for things that all people do, but not all people get put in cages for their lives.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This July will mark the four-year anniversary of BLM, and Garza said she wanted to make it clear that it is not just a movement for black lives, “but a movement to save all of our lives.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said there are misunderstandings of the movement that distract from its message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Black Lives Matter started as a love note to black people, but it is a demand and a call to action,” Garza said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77388\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77388\" data-attachment-id=\"77388\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-02/black-lives-matter-co-founder-debunks-blm-myths-at-campbell-hall/alicia-garza-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"768,512\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Alicia Garza-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-77388\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77388\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said this movement began in generations prior to hers and is now a continuation of a long legacy of struggle in the United States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza also outlined three “myths” of BLM: the notions that it is anti-police, anti-white and black supremacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said the movement is not anti-police, but, rather, it is against the perpetuation of cycles of violence. She said she believes the cycle will end when someone is courageous enough to say that the institutions and systems in place “are not working.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza also said the allegation that BLM is a black supremacy group “just doesn’t make sense.” The activist group does not want to perpetuate the same systems that oppress people but, rather, to transform the powers that operate those systems, Garza said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christine Dolan, associate director at the Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity and one of the organizers for the event, said BLM week is about “coalition building.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dolan said they believe the event was an effective way to bring people together and “center the Black Lives Matter movement on campus.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fabiola Pérez, a fourth-year biological anthropology major, said she thought Garza made “all these issues human” and spoke about them in realistic terms.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like a lot of the stuff we see is so out there and it feels so far away, when in reality it’s very immediate and very close,” Pérez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said she wanted the audience to leave thinking about “the ways we want to create movement and the ways we establish power.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the U.S. needs “really courageous white people” to realize white supremacy does exist, adding that economic struggles are national concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “White folks need this movement,” she said. “They’re being fed a lie, too.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77525\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-02/black-lives-matter-co-founder-debunks-blm-myths-at-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77525\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-02/black-lives-matter-co-founder-debunks-blm-myths-at-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-02/black-lives-matter-co-founder-debunks-blm-myths-at-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-02/black-lives-matter-co-founder-debunks-blm-myths-at-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-02/black-lives-matter-co-founder-debunks-blm-myths-at-campbell-hall/","id":2395,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2394,2393,2392],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
