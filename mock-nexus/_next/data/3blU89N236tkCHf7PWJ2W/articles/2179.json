I’ve experienced all sorts of people.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen, a third-year history major, is a part of Mock Trial at UCSB and Vice President of the Phi Alpha Delta Pre-Law Fraternity. He said he has no declared conflicts of interest, as he had joined Mock Trial after Kopel left.</p>\n<p>“When I was growing up, I talked a lot. The only thing my mom told me to do was go into law,” Nguyen said, “[during high school] I was in Mock Trial, Model UN … I love the judicial process.”</p>\n<p>“I am really good at working with people; I’d like to think that I’m a people person… I believe I have a strong work ethic.”</p>\n<p>Marron, a fourth-year political science and communications double major, said she also has no conflicts of interest. Along with Nguyen, she is part of the Phi Alpha Delta Pre-Law Fraternity.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen what the school is, especially what the students kind of want, as well,” she said.</p>\n<p>“I’ve worked closely with the student body… I’ve been on the student faculty committee for about two years now and work in the Office of Judicial Affairs, so I see the administrative side and the student side, as well.”</p>\n<p>Nilsen, a third-year computer science major, previously worked as a solicitor general for the A.S. attorney general’s office. He was not present at Wednesday’s meeting to speak.</p>\n<p>The Senate <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-17/a-s-senate-tables-judicial-council-appointment-for-the-third-week-in-a-row/\">previously questioned</a> Nilsen’s ability to be impartial, given that his time on Mock Trial overlapped with Kopel’s.</p>\n<p>However, they approved him on Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>Before Wednesday’s meeting, only one student, second-year history of public policy and political science double major Raymond Alonso, sat on the council.</p>\n<p>The council requires three members to meet quorum.</p>\n<p>Because it was unable to meet quorum, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/petitions-regarding-a-s-spring-elections-remain-undecided-as-judicial-council-unable-to-meet-quorum/\">two petitions</a> – one regarding alleged campaign violations by Campus United (CU) during the Spring 2018 Elections, and another that would reinstate External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA)-elect Mayela Morales – were left unaddressed.</p>\n<p>The Council will now choose a chair amongst themselves and submit their choice to Kopel, who will approve it, Kopel previously told the Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Are we going to burn?’”</p>\n<p>Tamara was rerouted to the long road out of Magalia toward Chico, which took her approximately three and a half hours.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85122\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1289994422\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"85119\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85122\" data-attachment-id=\"85122\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-29/camp-fire-leaves-ucsb-students-hometown-destroyed/online-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1143&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1143\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ONLINE-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=250%2C143&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=888%2C507&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-85122\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3-1024x585.jpg?resize=888%2C507\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"507\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C585&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=250%2C143&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?resize=768%2C439&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ONLINE-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-85122\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Butson family</em></p></div>\n<p>For those three and a half hours, Mikala heard nothing.</p>\n<p>“The route that they took up through the mountains has no reception,” she said. “The last time I had gotten a text was ‘We’re evacuating, do you want me to grab you anything?’ and then I didn’t hear from them for like four hours.”</p>\n<p>With both misinformation and a general lack of information coursing through social media during the early hours, Mikala was left to wonder if her family had been lost to the flames.</p>\n<p>“I wish I was there to help my mom, get stuff out of the house and help her evacuate and be there for them,” she said. “But I was all the way here. I felt kind of hopeless.”</p>\n<p>Residents driving out of Paradise and Magalia on the main road, the Skyway, found themselves <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/11/10/this-is-when-i-die-unforgettable-tales-of-escape-from-the-camp-fire/?utm_content=tw-mercnews&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social\">trapped </a>as the flames licked their cars, killing a number of residents.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, Magalia altered the roads in its downtown to be more reminiscent of an old town, like Truckee, Calif., Tamara said.</p>\n<p>But that meant converting two of the four lanes into parking — two lanes that were unavailable for residents as they attempted to evacuate.</p>\n<p>“Everybody was kind of freaking out, going ‘How did this happen? How did we get all these billions of dollars to change this road?’” Tamara said. “‘We need the access, because if there’s a fire, where are we going to go?’”</p>\n<p>“And so, sure enough, a fire happened and everybody was like ‘Why did they do this? It’s like they meant to kill us or something.’”</p>\n<p>The lack of official communication, coupled with the minimal evacuation routes, meant many residents died in their homes.</p>\n<p>“We’re on an emergency system. They’ve been preparing us for a couple years. Like, ‘If there’s an emergency, we’re gonna call everybody reverse 911,” Tamara said. “We all felt pretty comfortable, like they’re going to call us for any emergency. Nobody knew anything, and it was early in the morning, you know, people were still sleeping. And that’s how come a lot of people died in their homes and in their cars. It was horrifying. It was horrible.”</p>\n<p>“We felt so forgotten, so alone.”</p>\n<p>The Butsons’ house is still standing after the fire.</p>\n<p>“Our house is pretty smoke damaged inside,” Tamara said. “We have soil outside that’s toxic, and the insurance is going to give us no money. They’re only going to bring in cleaners and have them clean.”</p>\n<p>If Tamara feels that the cleaning job is not satisfactory and there are still leftover toxins, she then has to pay for tests to measure the toxicity, which cost anywhere between $1,000 and $5,000, according to Tamara.</p>\n<p>“I can’t go back to my house; there’s no way I can live in toxicity,” Tamara said. “My house should’ve burned down because if it would’ve burned down, I at least could’ve had money to then take it and then pay off the bank and then start again.”</p>\n<p>“But it didn’t, so I’m one of the unlucky ones.”</p>\n<p>Tamara, Mikala and Nick moved to Paradise when Mikala was three years old, and eventually moved to Magalia, the neighboring town.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“I’m 54. I have no idea … I just can’t make enough money starting over. I don’t know what I’m going to do.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“It’s difficult to say I enjoyed growing up there,” Mikala said. “My mom had only just been able to get a job that was higher-paying. None of the people around me had a lot.”</p>\n<p>Butte County is one of the poorest counties in California, Tamara added.</p>\n<p>“People literally … the seniors, the disabled, the single moms, they absolutely have no money. I’m fortunate. I feel fortunate. I came with nothing, but I feel fortunate,” Tamara said.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 17, President Trump visited Butte County alongside Governor Jerry Brown and Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>\n<p>“When he was giving his speech, [Trump] couldn’t even remember the name of Paradise. He called it ‘Pleasure,’” Mikala said. “His response has not been supportive.”</p>\n<p>“He has basically said it was our fault … that we should’ve raked our leaves, we should’ve done these small things,” she added. “He’s denying any bigger issue of climate change or any bigger issue of PG&amp;E being the cause of it.”</p>\n<p>Mikala spoke about the political attitudes of Butte County and Paradise more specifically. Although the area is mostly conservative, many Trump supporters questioned Trump’s response to the Camp Fire, according to Mikala.</p>\n<p>However, she doesn’t believe political opinions have substantially changed after the fire.</p>\n<p>“It’s very red, and, basically, the opinions reflect that.”</p>\n<p>There is one common sentiment on the ground: <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/11/09/pge-power-lines-may-have-sparked-deadly-butte-county-wildfire-according-to-radio-transmissions/\">Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E)</a> is to blame, Mikala said.</p>\n<p>Months ago, Mikala and her family got a notice in the mail from PG&amp;E which indicated that when there is high fire danger, PG&amp;E would shut off the power.</p>\n<p>A couple of days before the fire, PG&amp;E reported that there would be high winds and therefore the power would be shut off, Mikala said.</p>\n<p>“They had never shut off the power, even though they told us they were going to,” she said. Then, the fire happened.</p>\n<p>“There are already people who are starting the lawsuits against them and like getting legal teams together,” Mikala added. “I’ve seen hundreds of people talk about it online. If they find out that’s what caused it, it’s going to be a huge thing.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-paradise-fire-lawsuit-1542165733-htmlstory.html\"><i>The Los Angeles Times</i> reported</a> that people who lost homes in the Camp Fire have, in fact, already begun suing PG&amp;E.</p>\n<p>According to the lawsuit, PG&amp;E “did not maintain its infrastructure and failed to properly inspect and manage its power transmission lines,” the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reported.</p>\n<p>In the days since Tamara and Nick left Magalia, they traveled to Santa Barbara to stay with Mikala in her one-bedroom apartment, which is “paid for entirely by financial aid and loans from the school,” Mikala wrote on the family’s <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/butson-family-camp-fire-fund?fbclid=IwAR0Lkse9VxkxeRzEuh4HMqnqfMJqLXW9R9ffpXboxChCWDuZqxBiK18nmQM\">GoFundMe</a> page.</p>\n<p>After staying with Mikala for about a week and a half, the two found an apartment in Solvang, which they were able to furnish with two beds and a few household items with money from the GoFundMe.</p>\n<p>Mikala signed them up for Adopt a Family, a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/paradisefireadoptafamily/?ref=group_header\">Facebook group</a> to connect those affected by the Camp Fire and those who want to help. The person who has ‘adopted’ Tamara’s family has been sending them items every day from their Amazon Wish List, including a coloring book to help Tamara de-stress.</p>\n<p>But what comes next?</p>\n<p>“Wow,” Tamara exhaled.</p>\n<p>A heavy pause followed.</p>\n<p>“You know, I’m freaking out right now. I loved my job. I finally had a job that I was doing so well financially, and I had it planned out. I was paying off things, I was going to save. I had enough for taxes. I was feeling good about it,” she said.</p>\n<p>“I’m 54. I have no idea … I just can’t make enough money starting over. I don’t know what I’m going to do.”</p>\n<p>For now, Tamara sees herself putting down roots in Solvang, close to her daughter.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a really hard time having my family apart,” she said.</p>\n<p>Mikala, who will be graduating this spring, is looking to get a full-time position at the UCSB Library, where she currently works part-time.</p>\n<p>“I’d like to go to graduate school, but I was going to take the year off. But now, maybe I should just go on for financial purposes instead of taking the year,” she said.</p>\n<p>The family doesn’t see a future for them in their hometown.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think [Paradise and Magalia] are going to rebuild, and if [they do], it’s going to be many, many, many years because it’s just so devastated,” Mikala said.</p>\n<p>Tamara and her son will be in Solvang for at least the next year.</p>\n<p>“[Nick] was here awhile back and loved Solvang, and he told me many many months ago that if there’s anywhere he wanted to live, it would be Solvang,” she said. “So, I said, ‘That’s where we’re going to live,’ and here we are.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The Public and Mental Health Commission was approved for $26,000 for this year, according to Kaayal.</p>\n<p>“Around $10,000 is specifically for the Mental Health Conference,” he said. The rest of the money would be allocated toward honoraria, marketing and projects.</p>\n<p>In the past, the Mental Health Planning Committee, an independent entity, has planned the annual Mental Health Conference. This year, the Public and Mental Health Commission plans on helping the committee.</p>\n<p>The executive board of the Public and Mental Health Commission will have a conference coordinator position dedicated to Mental Health Conference planning, according to Kaayal.</p>\n<p>The executive board will also include co-chairs, policy analysts, a mental health special projects coordinator, a public health special projects coordinator, a nontraditional first generation representative, an event/program director, a QTPOC representative, a financial coordinator and a marketing outreach director among others.</p>\n<p>Kaayal plans to be one of the co-chairs alongside Bongi Makatini, a fourth-year biological sciences major and Spanish minor.</p>\n<p>Makatini reached out to Kaayal after seeing the work he was doing regarding mental and public health. After the resolution passed in March 2018, Kaayal and Makatini came together during Spring Quarter 2018 and worked on the commission over the summer.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t want to step on the toes of the great work that’s already been done on campus, but we really wanted to see A.S. taking more of a stand to try to help tackle different issues regarding mental health here on campus,” Makatini said.</p>\n<p>The Committee on Committees already approved Kaayal and Makatini for the co-chair positions and submitted the two appointments to A.S. President Brooke Kopel.</p>\n<p>Kopel has sent those appointments to A.S. Senate, and A.S. Senate now must vote in favor of the appointments. The Senate must also approve all other executive board appointments.</p>\n<p>Even though the executive board has yet to be approved, Kaayal and Makatini have started planning prospective projects.</p>\n<p>One of the projects involves free flu shots for UCSB students, according to Kaayal. The project would be funded by the commission.</p>\n<p>“We’re also working with student health and library administration and custodial services to start placing hand sanitizer dispensers around campus,” Kaayal said.</p>\n<p>“We’re starting to target the library first and then hopefully branch that out to the UCen and lecture halls.”</p>\n<p>Makatini mentioned the toll the quarter system takes on the mental health of UCSB students, and how students who never had mental health problems prior to college “all of a sudden have anxiety or depression or any other mental health disorders.”</p>\n<p>“We really want to make sure that students have a central voice through Associated Students to be able to utilize these different resources,” Makatini said.</p>\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.
