All proceeds from the event will be donated to the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unique to UCSB is the inclusion of herstories, a storytelling portion built on students’ experiences. According to Kyeremateng, UCSB may discontinue The Vagina Monologues  in coming years to focus solely on Herstories. Herstories involves first-hand prose written by students, creating an even stronger bond with the campus and community. The portion will be directed by Rachel Gregory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Kyeremateng’s key influences on the production has been the addition of diversity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The feminist movement is rising, and Herstories brings up a more diverse cast that The Vagina Monologues tend to not have,” Kyeremateng, who is a veteran of the production, said. “Looking back, the troupe was not as diverse as it could have been.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The show stresses the importance of representation, she said, with this year’s cast including a bigender member for the first time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While The Vagina Monologues alone are wonderfully informative, Kyeremateng said the name can exclude certain experiences; for example, someone who identifies as a woman may not be able to participate in childbirth, thus excluding LGBTQ+ identities. Kyeremateng is also performing her own prose piece this year on being an undocumented black woman in the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophie Swezey, an actress working on the monologue “The Vagina Workshop” said her piece is about a middle-aged woman who goes to a “vagina workshop” to learn more about her vagina and how to make herself orgasm. She goes through a transformational experience</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> finds her clitoris and ultimately learns how to make herself orgasm.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We live in a society that tends to discourage women from exploring themselves, touching themselves, and talking about their vaginas,” she said in an email. “I think in essence that’s the most powerful part of The Vagina monologues — that women are talking about their experiences and discussing ‘taboo topics.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While never having had this woman’s exact experience, Swezey identifies with her character in terms of self-confidence and comfort with one’s body, issues many women face.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Vagina Monologues intend to be a uniting and empowering show for women, but Kyeremateng said, “It’s not exclusive to just women; in order for the feminist movement to work, we need to get our allies involved.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those who are uncomfortable attending an event where women openly discuss vaginas, actress Rose Houska said, “It’s okay to be uncomfortable. These are things we are not ‘supposed’ to talk about, so naturally it’s [going to] be uncomfortable.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tickets can be found online <a href=\"https://events.ucsb.edu/org/os/wett\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, at the A.S.

The remaining 97 votes went toward other Democratic and third-party candidates.</p>\n<p>Nearly 90 percent of voters chose to support Democratic candidates at the polls. Abboud said Sanders’s strong lead was likely due to support from the Sanders campaign support throughout campus and I.V.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t just that people wanted to vote for Bernie, but Bernie helped get people politically aware,” Abboud said. “A lot of the people we talked to knew about the issues very early on, so it was a good year.”</p>\n<p>The voter turnout among UCSB students and I.V. residents is even more astonishing because the primary election was held on last week of the quarter, when most students were completing final exams.</p>\n<p>“The numbers … show the level of organization and volunteer efforts here for the primary were extremely higher than average,” Abboud said. “The whole campaign was centered around driving turnout, because the primary was during finals week.”</p>\n<p>Abboud also noted that UCSB and I.V. voters will be especially important to the general election in November because of specific ballot measures, such as a marijuana legalization bill and the vote for I.V. to become a Community Services District (CSD).</p>\n<p>“The Isla Vista Community Services District election is in November and that is the most direct thing anyone could ever vote on to make Isla Vista a better place,” Abboud said. “So we believe that the excitement and the promise of CSD plus the importance of all the other races of elected office and the wide array of propositions on the ballot will be driving factors for people to vote.”</p>\n<p>Voters in Santa Barbara also selected candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the state senate, assembly and the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors. Final results will be determined after the general election on Nov. 8.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, June 23, edition of the</em> Daily

Guest House, which began renovations in 2014, welcomed UCSB students and staff to its grand opening ceremony on Jan. 31. The $30 million project was financed primarily by a 30-year, $12.84 million loan.<em> Campbell Nolan / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Marc Fisher, vice chancellor for campus design and facilities, the original building needed renovation because of building damage and a lack of modern conveniences such as an elevator.</p>\n<p>The heating, plumbing and electrical systems had all been in place since the building’s construction in 1968 and were at risk of failure.</p>\n<p>In order to make The Club economically viable, the university added 30 guest rooms to the four remaining original rooms after two were torn down in the course of renovation.</p>\n<p>The total cost of the building was $20.6 million, $1 million of which was donated by Betty Elings Wells, a frequent donor to UCSB.</p>\n<p>The project took a year longer than expected because of unforeseen soil conditions, as well as discrepancies between the working drawings from the 1960s and the actual condition of the faculty club.</p>\n<p>The renovation was partially financed by a 30-year loan, which is standard for large buildings, according to Chuck Haines, the acting assistant chancellor for the Office of Budget and Planning. The loan totals $12.84 million and has a 3.78 percent interest rate.</p>\n<p>Haines estimates that the interest payments will come out to around $9 million, pushing the total cost of the project to about $30 million.</p>\n<p>The university expects revenue from The Club to pay for the cost of the building. According to Haines, UCSB will not use student tuition dollars to finance the building.</p>\n<p>According to Robert Kelley, UCSB historian, the original faculty club was completed in 1968 at the suggestion of Professor Steven Horvath.</p>\n<p>Horvath insisted that the building be a distinguished venue for visiting guests as well as faculty and community gatherings and that it be by the lagoon to capture a “serene ambiance.”</p>\n<p>Fisher said the campus had explored the possibility of relocating The Club to a different location or repurposing the old building, but the university felt strongly that the location’s historical significance be preserved.</p>\n<p>The new building, which overlooks the lagoon, has 34 guest rooms, a bar and lounge, private meeting and conference areas and a terrace.</p>\n<p>Room rates start at $270 for non-members and $230 for members. In addition to paying off the loan, revenue from The Club will also support the staff and building upkeep.</p>\n<p>“The Club &amp; Guest House at UC Santa Barbara is designed to serve the temporary housing needs of University-affiliated guests and individuals conducting University business,” the building’s website says.</p>\n<p>In order to accommodate the limited space and high demand, guests who wish to stay at The Club must be attending a campus event or visit, be a club member, visiting faculty or conducting university business.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, Feb. 9, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.
