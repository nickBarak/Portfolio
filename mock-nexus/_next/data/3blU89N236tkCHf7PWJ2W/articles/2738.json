Sworn in May 27 to fill vacancies left by three senators who stepped down shortly after the spring elections, on-campus senator and first-year undeclared major Elizabeth Brock and on-campus senator and first-year political science major Mercedes Rodriguez were selected by a special committee after an interview process to replace Brendan Korbas and David Xie. Off-campus senator and second-year political science major Kelly Pearman replaced Jake Johnson after having been his runner-up in the spring 2015 elections.</p>\n<p><b>ON-CAMPUS SENATOR </b><b>ELIZABETH BROCK</b></p>\n<p><b><i>Daily Nexus</i></b><b>: Why did you apply to be an on-campus senator?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>: I love being involved and am extremely passionate about impacting lives; I felt this position could give me a better chance in reaching as many students as possible across our campus and that my plans to impact our shared community could be put in motion more effectively and efficiently.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: Have you been involved with A.S. before?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>: I have not, so this is very exciting for me!</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: How have you been involved at UCSB?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>: This past year, I’ve been the president of the amazing Santa Cruz Residence Hall … Being president automatically placed me in the Residence Halls Association … where I also discovered my passion for student affairs. I’m also a newer part of the National Residence Hall Honorary, or NRHH, and it’s been great getting to know that new family as well.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What do you hope to accomplish this year?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>: I hope to eventually separate Counseling and Psychological Services [C.A.P.S.] from Career Services, as they’re both currently housed in the same building … It’s absurd that certain counselors at C.A.P.S. have offices the size of closets … I believe the C.A.P.S. building should also be painted and possibly renovated. Hopefully, there can be a collaboration with our university’s art department to create some beautiful murals over that Pepto-Bismol pink. That space is supposed to be a welcoming invitation for students seeking help, and walking up to that building illustrates the exact opposite. We should feel motivated and inspired when entering the C.A.P.S. environment, and brightening its atmosphere would truly help.</p>\n<p>Another project I’d like to take on is placing mental health kits in every room of every residence hall before move-in day Fall Quarter. I feel this will show incoming as well as returning students how valuable and vital our mental well-being is. By placing these kits in the rooms first thing, we’ll be able to create a healthier, more active and more knowledgeable mental health environment where students will hopefully begin to value their internal well-being much more seriously.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: Why do you think you will be a good senator?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>: I am straightforward when addressing situations, and I’m not afraid to communicate when hard conversations are needed … My compassion for others and my overall love for our university drives my passion to be in this position and will allow me to work devotedly and wholeheartedly towards every goal that’s in front of me. I maintain a very open mind, and I love to hear about ways to improve what’s already set in motion. I believe in listening to other perspectives before solidifying any decision … I am qualified with leading a council and being an active and leading member in multiple organizations through high school to now. I enjoy working in a team and deeply value collaboration and coexisting efforts to get things done, which I believe will help me connect with departments across campus to complete my mental health projects.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What do you want to change about A.S.?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>:  A.S. should not be about who’s in which party, who has the greatest ego or who’s enemies and friends with who. There should not be that internal drama because it infects the organization and results negatively in helping our community and constituents. We should all be working together towards the same goal of bettering our campus to brighten student lives.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>OFF-CAMPUS SENATOR KELLY PEARMAN</b></p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: Why did you run to be an off-campus senator?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: I chose to run to be a senator because I really wanted the opportunity to improve the campus and community for students and Isla Vista residents. I really have the passion to be a voice for students and I am so excited to be one of their representatives. I can’t wait to create change.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What experience do you have being involved in the UCSB community?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: I have been involved in A.S. for the past two years. As a first-year, I was a fellow in the Internal Vice President’s Office. During my second year at UCSB, I was the senate coordinator in the Internal Vice President’s Office and I was also the recruitment and outreach coordinator for Committee on Committees.</p>\n<p>I am a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma. I was also involved with RHA during my first year at UCSB.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What projects do you want to complete as a senator this year?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: My first project goal is to create a more interactive training for sexual assault intervention and prevention. I want to work with Panhellenic and Interfraternity Council to implement this. Also, I want to collaborate with my fellow senators Austin Hechler and Mika Kawakami on this project, who also have knowledge about Greek life.</p>\n<p>Another project I want to work on is developing a long-term parking plan in Isla Vista … It is creating safety problems and causing I.V. residents to receive citations. I want to work with the EVPLA Office and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol on this project along with holding forums for students to voice their opinion on how they want parking to change in the future. Having a lot of student input is really important.</p>\n<p>My third project goal is to create vending machines in Isla Vista with school and study supplies in them so students can access these resources at any time of the day. A few previous senators have worked on this project, and I want to continue it and implement it.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What do you think will be your biggest challenge during your time as off-campus senator?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: I expect that it will be challenging to work with 24 other very passionate people, and I know some meetings will be difficult when our opinions clash.</p>\n<p>People will disagree, but I plan to put myself in other people’s shoes to understand where they are coming from. I think it’s really important to try to understand why people believe the things they do and that will really help me in deciding about legislation and working with people throughout the year.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What do you want incoming senators to do differently than their predecessors?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: I think that the Senate should really take the time and effort during the first few weeks of the term to really get to know the Legal Code, the financial policies and the structure of the association itself. When Senators are more knowledgeable about the association and its governing documents, etcetera, they will be able to navigate it a lot better when writing legislation and when they are initiating projects.</p>\n<p>Senators should definitely take extra steps to work with Senators that they normally hadn’t already worked with. It makes Senate a closer group of people with better camaraderie and working rapport.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What will make you a good senator?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: I have been very involved in A.S. for the last two years, and this gives me the experience and knowledge about what students want, and how we as student leaders can give that to them. Being the senate coordinator for a year gave me the knowledge of what it means and what it takes to be a great senator. I also have worked with past senators on projects and legislation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>ON-CAMPUS SENATOR MERCEDES RODRIGUEZ</b></p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: </b><b>Why did you apply to be an on-campus senator?</b></p>\n<p><em>Rodriguez:</em> At first, I didn’t know much about it, so my RA kind of encouraged me because I’m in Hall Council currently and he thought it would be a good fit for me, and he also explained to me how we can help advocate for students and get their voices heard, and that’s what I really want to focus on, being a political science major actually wanting to go into activism.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: How have you been involved at UCSB?</b></p>\n<p><em>Rodriguez: </em>I actually wasn’t involved in A.S., I was just involved in Hall Council. I was a multicultural awareness chair, so I pick up on all of the isms, and that made me a lot more aware … I think knowing a lot more of those ideas is going to help me just kind of implement the things that I actually want to see being done … I think racism is going to be a huge one.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What are your goals for the coming year?</b></p>\n<p><em>Rodriguez: </em>Definitely just trying to push for diversity, I think that’s going to be my focal point for this year. Not necessarily to offset the demographics, but kind of teach people that our demographics are not as correct as some people might think they are, and that the underrepresented do have a voice and they’re actually very vital to our school. So I’m going to be focusing definitely on the minorities and just having their voices heard and all their work being recognized.</p>\n<p>Living on the multicultural floor this year, I know I definitely want to bring it back because I know it is going to change into a first-generation floor. But I want to bring back the multicultural floor definitely because I feel like it had a huge impact on my overall experience of being a first-year … For now, that’s the only concrete idea I have, because I just currently was aware that I got into office.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What do you think will be your biggest challenge as a senator?</b></p>\n<p><em>Rodriguez: </em>Being biracial, first of all, because I am Caucasian and I am Hispanic so it’s kind of hard to be myself in both positions, because I do look more Hispanic, I get mistaken for being full Hispanic … I’m going to try to understand both sides of the spectrum, but it’s just going to be really hard.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63991\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-02/new-a-s-senators-discuss-goals-for-upcoming-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63991\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-02/new-a-s-senators-discuss-goals-for-upcoming-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-02/new-a-s-senators-discuss-goals-for-upcoming-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-02/new-a-s-senators-discuss-goals-for-upcoming-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-02/new-a-s-senators-discuss-goals-for-upcoming-year/","id":2738,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[2737,2736,2735],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report","biography":"Not available","articles":[1981,1982,2072,2234,2284,2351,2370,2417,2437,2512,2534,2614,2711,2733,2738,2754,2801,2827,2835,2940,2984,2992,3004,3036,3044,3090,3438,3439,3444,3450,3453,3465,3470,3471,3520,3581,3628,3655,3679,3698,3764,3776,3789,3791,3792,3794,3797,3800,3907,3958,3970,4043,4061,4134,4135,4169,4189,4190,4196,4197,4199,4213,4215,4216,4230,4232,4236,4244,4249,4250,4253,4262,4271,4277,4279,4281,4293,4294,4296,4309,4314,4315,4325,4328,4330,4343,4345,4346,4354,4364,4373,4374,4400,4405,4411,4412,4424,4425,4427,4429,4439,4446,4460,4461,4463,4468,4485,4486,4580,4635,4638,4640,4644,4702,4707,4728,4761,4777,4814,8046],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Party Politics Extend Past A.S.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students and administrators will come together on Friday to discuss demands made by students. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Students and administrators will come together on Friday to discuss demands made by students during the May 13 sit-in.</p>\n<p>The “It’s Not On Us, It’s On You” campaign led by survivors of sexual assault Alejandra Melgoza, Lexi Weyrick and Melissa Vasquez will host an open forum discussion between students and university administrators on Friday in the State Street room of the University Center at 10 a.m.</p>\n<p>Melgoza, Weyrick and Vasquez led a 13-hour sit-in at Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s office on May 13 to demand specific policies to improve the university’s handling of sexual assault cases. One of the stipulations made in the discussion that concluded the sit-in was an agreement to hold a public forum which Yang would attend. Interim Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Mary Jacob, Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming and additional administrators, including members of the Office of Judicial Affairs, have also committed to participate in the forum.</p>\n<p>The forum will include clarification of the demands and further discussion of plans to meet the students’ requests. On the event Facebook page, organizers cautioned those who plan to attend that administrators are mandatory reporters, meaning students should not share details of their experiences of sexual violence or sexual assault if they do not wish to “inadvertently begin an investigation.”</p>\n<p>Gaucho Consent Co-Chair, Take Back the Night Executive Board member and second-year sociology major Lexi Weyrick said the forum will provide students an opportunity to voice their concerns to administrators on issues related to sexual violence and sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“It’s a good setup for students to be able to air their grievances, for administration to see that this isn’t just about the three of us, to make sure that people are aware of the implications of sexual assault and sexual violence on the campus as a whole,” Weyrick said.</p>\n<p>Second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major Alejandra Melgoza said the event aims to provide students the opportunity to present their concerns on sexual violence and sexual assault to Yang in person.</p>\n<p>“It is an open forum for students to voice their concerns to Chancellor Yang and also to voice their concerns about our demands and help brainstorm ideas on how to further improve them or actually get them to happen,” Melgoza said. “It is just really a meeting for students to come talk to the Chancellor about their concerns — since it is pretty hard to get a meeting with him, we figured this would be a good way to have students talk to him face to face.”</p>\n<p>Fleming said while Yang is often limited in the amount of time he can speak with students in person about their concerns, other members-of the administration frequently work one-on-one with students.</p>\n<p>“The Chancellor has a pretty full calendar, and so it is challenging sometimes for students,” Fleming said. “Certainly, a lot of us at Students Affairs spend a lot of time working with students directly.”</p>\n<p>Fleming also said administrators have discussed plans to increase the amount of communication between students and administrators with It’s Not On Us, It’s On You leaders.</p>\n<p>“What we probably need is some more regular opportunities to hear from students,” Fleming said. “We’ve talked about establishing more of a permanent group that students can be part of that would meet just on a regular basis, maybe quarterly, with those of us that work in these areas to share.”</p>\n<p>First-year global studies major Catt Phan said she spent six hours at the sit-in and plans to attend the forum because she believes it is “crucial” for students to hold the university accountable for the ways they have handled sexual assault in past years.</p>\n<p>“It seems like admin and judicial affairs care more about our student fees instead of our sanity and bodies,” Phan said in an email. “It’s up to us to have productive dialogue because if change doesn’t happen now, it’s not going to happen later.”</p>\n<p>Phan said she believes sexual violence may be the biggest issue on campus and in Isla Vista and the university needs to better educate students on the importance of consent.</p>\n<p>“With the reputation of a ‘party school,’ there is a higher risk of sexual assault and unfortunately not enough people are educated about the sexual violence issues,” Phan said in an email. “We need to educate people and de-stigmatize sexual assault … the idea of consent needs to be further emphasized and survivors need to feel safe enough to come forth with their stories.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs office fellow and first year psychology major Alissa Gomez said she hopes to see a large number of students at the event because she believes sexual violence and sexual assault are issues affecting students both on campus and on a national level.</p>\n<p>“I’m hoping that people will feel free to voice their opinions as needed and that they’ll get to say what they feel is needed to their administrators,” Gomez said. “We have the ability as college students to make this change not only on our campus, but on campuses across the nation.”</p>\n<p>Weyrick said while she is uncertain how many students will turn out to participate in the discussion, the campaign as a whole has received positive feedback.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had a lot of interest. I feel like there will be a good amount of people, even if it’s just even to like critique our demands I feel like there will be turnout,” Weyrick said. “Also, to address Chancellor Yang, having that opportunity, I think, will get turnout.”</p>\n<p>Last Thursday, Melgoza, Vasquez and Weyrick planned to speak in public forum at the UC Board of Regents meeting to present their demands to UC President Janet Napolitano and Governor Jerry Brown, but were unable to attend due to flight cancelations and delays, according to Weyrick.</p>\n<p>“We got to the airport in plenty of time to catch our flight, but it was overbooked and so they wouldn’t let us on the plane even though we had reserved seats,” Weyrick said. “So that started just a snowball effect — we couldn’t get on the standby for the second, our third flight got cancelled, the fourth flight was delayed an hour.”</p>\n<p>Weyrick said although she, Melgoza and Vasquez were unable to attend the meeting, they still plan to make their demands known at a system-wide level.</p>\n<p>“We were unable to attend the Regents meeting, but we do still have a meeting with [UC Senior Vice President and Chief Compliance and Audit Officer] Sheryl Vacca in the works, so we’re still meeting with her, regardless,” Weyrick said. “We have a guarantee of a meeting, we are just scheduling it now. It will definitely be in the next couple of weeks.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, May 28, 2015 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article originally stated Alejandra Melgoza is a second-year Chican@ studies and political science double major. However, Melgoza is a second year double majoring in Chican@ studies and history of public policy.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63917\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/open-forum-to-discuss-sexual-assault-policy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63917\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/open-forum-to-discuss-sexual-assault-policy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/open-forum-to-discuss-sexual-assault-policy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/open-forum-to-discuss-sexual-assault-policy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/open-forum-to-discuss-sexual-assault-policy/","id":2735,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[2734,2733,2732],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Administrators, Students Discuss Sexual Assault Case Procedures","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Chancellor-Yang-Forum-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Chancellor-Yang-Forum-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The “It’s Not On Us, It’s On You” campaign leaders and survivors of sexual assault Alejandra Melgoza, Melissa Vasquez and Lexi Weyrick organized an open forum with Chancellor Henry T.

Attendees had the opportunity to ask questions of the campaign leaders and participating administrators regarding current sexual assault policies and the 13 demands.</p>\n<p>UCSB Office of Equal Opportunity &amp; Sexual Harassment and Title IX Compliance Director Ricardo Alcaino said the office cannot hire staff based on race or gender, but hopes to create a more diverse staff to fulfill the 11th demand.</p>\n<p>“We cannot select individuals due to their race or gender, we can’t do that, but we definitely can cast very broad nets and make sure our pools are very diverse so naturally, obviously, we will be more likely get a diverse candidate,” Alcaino said.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator and second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major Melgoza said the fifth demand calls for the creation of an Associated Students Survivor Fund to cover medical, travel, housing and other expenses for survivors of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“We are making sure that those funds are available to students and that students know these funds are available to them, because, often times, survivors have expenses, particularly for housing,” Melgoza said. “They want to move out of their living space, especially if it is out in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>According to Gaucho Consent Co-Chair, Take Back the Night Executive Board member and second-year sociology major Weyrick, the A.S. Survivor Fund would come from donations and would not increase student fees.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t coming from student fees, this doesn’t raise tuition or anything like that,” Weyrick said.</p>\n<p>Weyrick said availability of an A.S. Survivor Fund would not lead to false accusations of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“I really do not think there would be any kind of people that would want to first go through this and abuse these funds,” Weyrick said.</p>\n<p>Melgoza said Yang supports further examination of the second demand, which would increase the minimum suspension from one quarter to four quarters for students found guilty of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“The university still has to look into the legalities of that, and that is actually higher up, that is not something we can just do as a campus, so the Chancellor has given his support for a recommendation to pass that on,” Melgoza said.</p>\n<p>Melgoza said the third demand states the university must remove sexual assault perpetrators from university housing, employment or organizations.</p>\n<p>“Often times, immediate removal from housing doesn’t happen,” Melgoza said. “It is very interesting how students are removed from housing for playing loud music … but when it is about interpersonal violence it is not often talked about.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Police Department (UCPD) Detective Dawn Arviso said UCPD Chief Dustin Olson wants his staff to reflect the student body and supports the sixth demand, which aims to increase the number of women serving in local law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“Chief Olson is really big on having a diverse department that represents all of campus,” Arviso said. “We are really excited about that and most of those female officers and certainly a handful of male officers have expressed an interest in working with these types of crimes.”</p>\n<p>Office of Judicial Affairs (OJA) Assistant Dean of Student Life Suzanne Perkin said she needs further information regarding the eighth demand, calling for a method for students to evaluate and share their experiences with OJA.</p>\n<p>“We need something formal,” Perkin said. “Like here is an email that I got that was insensitive or here is an interaction that I had on this date that didn’t sit well with me or something like that. Something very concrete instead of just ‘it was mishandled.’”</p>\n<p>According to Weyrick, students who have bad experiences with OJA should be able to give a detailed report.</p>\n<p>“That is going to take time and trust for students,” Weyrick said, “It is not a grievance thing. It is a legitimate concern with how their case was handled, with who they were working with, so there would of course be solid like some sort of information something to relay, it would be specifics.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63990\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/administrators-students-discuss-sexual-assault-case-procedures/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63990\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/administrators-students-discuss-sexual-assault-case-procedures/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/administrators-students-discuss-sexual-assault-case-procedures/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/administrators-students-discuss-sexual-assault-case-procedures/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/administrators-students-discuss-sexual-assault-case-procedures/","id":2737,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2736,2735,2734],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
