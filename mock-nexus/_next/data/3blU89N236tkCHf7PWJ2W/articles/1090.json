The Gauchos are a team to keep an eye out for during the Big West championships and are aiming to make a memorable run for the NCAA regionals.</p>\n<p>“It never really surprises us when we win. We are a dangerous team,” Head Coach Simon Thibodeau said. “We are a sleeping team that is not ranked as high, but we are right there and we are playing better. We are ready to roll in the Big West, we can beat everyone in the conference.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, Santa Barbara continued its efficient play against the Mustangs. Sophomores Lou Adler and Amanda Atanasson earned victories as they made quick work of senior Bryn Bacharach and freshman Celine Gruaz on court three.</p>\n<p>Freshman Stephanie Yamada and junior Melissa Baker almost earned a shutout of their own beating sophomores Abigail Bacharach and Molly Reed 6-1.</p>\n<p>No. 21 ranked doubles duo junior Stefani Stojic and sophomore Palina Dubavets were ahead 5-0 before the match went on unfinished as Yamada and Baker were able to clinch the doubles point beforehand.</p>\n<p>With the score at 1-0, the Gauchos continued to outperform the Mustangs winning the next five points in singles never trailing at any point during the match.</p>\n<p>Adler, Dubavets, Stojic, junior Jamiee Gilbertson, and Atanassan all won their singles matches in convincing fashion extending the lead and ensuring the win against Cal Poly. With the score at 6-0, all eyes were on court six as sophomores Molly Reed and Natalie Da Silveira were in their third set.</p>\n<p>The first went in Da Silveira’s favor as she edged out Reed 6-4. Reed came back in the second set winning 6-2, to force a third set between the two.</p>\n<p>Neither player would give in easily, putting up 18 points between each other in the third set.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs received their first team point as Reed put 10 past Da Silveira in the third set. Reed extended her singles win streak to three straight and ended her season going 6-4 in singles.</p>\n<p>With their momentous win to close out the Big West, the Gauchos turned around to wrap up their regular season against a tough Santa Clara team.</p>\n<p>Originally scheduled for a meeting in March, the match had to be postponed because of rain.With no rain clouds in sight, Santa Barbara and Santa Clara entered into a tough contest between two talented teams.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos managed to ensure a one point lead after winning the Doubles Point. Both pairs consisting of Dubavets &amp; Stojic as well as Yamada &amp; Baker won their respective sets 6-4 to start the match strong for UCSB.</p>\n<p>During the singles matches, the Broncos won two of the following five matches to get on the scoreboard. However, with strong play from Lou Adler, Stefani Stojic, and Natalie Da Silveira Santa Barbara won the match 4-2.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s two wins to conclude the season helped it to wrap up its campaign with a 15-7 overall and 7-1 Big West record. UCSB look to enter the big west tournament and dominate and avenge its only conference loss, 4-3, to Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>“We can dominate at each position. We lost 4-3 to Long Beach, [but] we still feel we can close out every team in the BWC 7-0 if we play well,” Thibodeau. “We are playing more together, we are more focused knowing the Big West [Championships] are coming. We are focused.</p>\n<p>Able to clinch the No. 2 seed in the conference championships, UCSB will likely face Cal State Northridge, who finished seventh in the Big West standings, on Thursday, April 28 at 8 a.m. The championships will take place at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70064\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/gauchos-end-season-on-a-high-note-clinch-no-2-seed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70064\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/gauchos-end-season-on-a-high-note-clinch-no-2-seed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/gauchos-end-season-on-a-high-note-clinch-no-2-seed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/gauchos-end-season-on-a-high-note-clinch-no-2-seed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/gauchos-end-season-on-a-high-note-clinch-no-2-seed/","id":1090,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[1089,1088,1087],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas","biography":"Not available","articles":[82,83,84,89,97,99,100,102,104,112,117,118,119,1014,1048,1051,1052,1074,1085,1087,1090,1105,1108,1109,3300],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Blue-Green Match Marks End of Conf.

They are also 0-1 against nationally ranked pairs.</p>\n<p>In singles, sophomore Molly Reed, a native of Sheffield, England, has led Cal Poly with the most matches won.</p>\n<p>She holds a 6-4 record and has been utilized from the three to the six slots, finding success mostly at the six.</p>\n<p>It will be important for the Mustangs to establish consistent play on the court versus a peaking Santa Barbara team that is currently only behind Long Beach State in the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>While UCSB may be favored against Cal Poly, it will embrace a more difficult challenge at Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>The Broncos happen to be riding a two match winning streak. Aside from its wins and losses, Santa Clara seems to have also discovered its identity with a talented depth chart.</p>\n<p>When competing in doubles play, the Broncos currently have a win percentage of .556.</p>\n<p>Leading the team are juniors Nabila Farah and Daniella Silva with an 8-8 dual record all at the one.</p>\n<p>Complementing the pair of juniors are freshman Madison Clarke and senior Chelby Cooke as they possess a 10-4 record at the second slot. However, against nationally ranked doubles competition Santa Clara is 0-2.</p>\n<p>In singles, leading the team is junior Daniella Silva. She is 12-6 overall and presents a versatile skillset that has served as beneficial for the rest of the team as she has found success in matching up with the competition on the one, two, three and four courts.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ match at Santa Clara will be their last of the regular season. Currently on a three-match winning streak, UCSB has the opportunity to enhance its momentum heading into the postseason as the Big West Tournament is to begin on Thursday, April 28.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces Cal Poly this Saturday, April 16 at 10 a.m. It will have another morning match on Sunday, April 17 at Santa Clara set for a start time of 11 a.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 18 of April 14, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69869\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/blue-green-match-marks-end-of-conf-play/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69869\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/blue-green-match-marks-end-of-conf-play/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/blue-green-match-marks-end-of-conf-play/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/blue-green-match-marks-end-of-conf-play/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/blue-green-match-marks-end-of-conf-play/","id":1087,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[1086,1085,1084],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Miles Seemann: A Long Road to Glory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FEAT-MensTennis_4-3-16_JoseAOchoa-4-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FEAT-MensTennis_4-3-16_JoseAOchoa-4-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"While performance on the court or field helps make up for wins and losses, the journey of UCSB men's tennis senior Miles Seemann illustrates the importance of staying committed to your dreams no matte...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_69850\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69850\" data-attachment-id=\"69850\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/miles-seemann-a-long-road-to-glory/miles-seemann-serves-the-ball-jose-ochoa-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FEAT-MensTennis_4-3-16_JoseAOchoa-4-web.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Miles Seemann serves the ball.

Some are home schooled so that they can travel to gain experience and exposure and others come from overseas to join colleges and play in the NCAA.</p>\n<p>For some of the nation’s best, this is a popular and potent route, but in looking at the unique journey of the Gauchos’ senior player, it is clearly not a definite path for all.</p>\n<p>Miles Seemaan is an anomaly. The local player from Solvang, CA has traveled an unbeaten path that began at Santa Ynez High School, which holds a Division IV athletic program.</p>\n<p>“Our conference was very small and I actually ended up being undefeated in both singles and doubles all four years,” Seemann said. “But the High School Public system for tennis doesn’t play as big of a factor as tournaments and tours do, so I didn’t get any offers from DI or DII.”</p>\n<p>Despite not losing a single conference match through high school, Seemann was forced to join a lower division school if he wanted to attend a university. Instead, the young man kept his talents local and joined the Vaqueros at Santa Barbara City College.</p>\n<p>Seemann had made the right choice as in his first and only year at SBCC he played well enough to be ranked No. 2 in doubles and No. 4 in singles play for all California junior colleges.</p>\n<p>As a result of his immediate success, Seemann was discovered by the Gauchos and joined their team as a walk-on, making it to the level that all players dream of after a ride that most couldn’t handle.</p>\n<p>This was just the beginning.</p>\n<p>“Miles was not a player that was on our radar for recruiting out of high school,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “We watched his progress at City College after seeing him play at an interclub match and knowing that he had some talent. Now he has progressed to one of the better doubles players in the country.”</p>\n<p>His decision to attend UCSB was again a fruitful one as not only did he climb to success, but SBCC’s men’s tennis program was cut the following year due to a plethora of these very same cases of one-year players.</p>\n<p>In spite of his timely departure from SBCC’s program, Seemann didn’t settle for the vanquishing of his former tennis team.</p>\n<p>Seemann and Davis helped revive the Vaqueros program this past season, which is just a small testament to the greatness that Seemann brings both on and off the court.</p>\n<p>In his early career with the Gauchos, Seemann played on the lower courts in singles and acted as a strong doubles partner finding success with any pairing. He helped UCSB to a couple of strong seasons before redshirting last year due to back issues. As he entered his final season of collegiate tennis, the true magic began to happen.</p>\n<p>In his senior year, the success started well before dual matches came along. Paired up with a fellow senior player in Nathan Eshmade, Seemann and his partner were entered into one of the state’s most prestigious tournaments, the 59<sup>th</sup> edition of the Southern California Intercollegiate Championships.</p>\n<p>Knocking down several tough, ranked opponents along the way, the duo was crowned in the final round after winning five straight matches.</p>\n<p>“It’s very humbling to see my name alongside of all the great players that have won this tournament and to bring the doubles draw championship to UCSB for the first time,” Seemann said. “Multiple doubles players that have been ranked No. 1 in the world have held this same title and it’s very inspiring.”</p>\n<p>After winning the tournament, Davis asked Seemann to continue working on his two-man game and become a doubles specialist for the team. As the dual match season began, the hard work began to show once more as the duo of Seeman and Eshmade started knocking teams off, even those of the highest caliber.</p>\n<p>“These guys really play tennis the right way, they compliment each other so well, and are just so beautiful to watch,” Davis explained. “At this level you never expect anyone to be a lock and essentially these two have been a lock for us all season playing on court one.”</p>\n<p>In dual match play, this No. 1 Gauchos duo currently holds a 12-4 record having topped two ranked doubles opponents and have won nine of their last ten matches.</p>\n<p>They have only been topped once this season by an unranked opponent and this strong Santa Barbara team has held a ranking of its own throughout a majority of the year that went as high as No. 23 in the nation. Since this ranking, the duo has only lost one match.</p>\n<p>“It’s really just a dream come true to see how well we have played this year,” Seemann said. “It’s been a great journey, I honestly never thought that I would ever be ranked in the nation in Division I doubles and again it is just so humbling to see my name next to all of these great players.”</p>\n<p>Despite not taking the usual route to the highest level of collegiate tennis, through hardwork and dedication Miles Seemann found himself amongst a crowd of the very best. His name is truly etched in Gaucho history.</p>\n<p>The journey is not over for this amazing young man whose coaches and teammates had nothing but kind words. Seemann will be playing in his final home match for the UCSB Gauchos tomorrow afternoon and will be honored at the team’s annual senior day alongside partner Eshmade and fellow senior Andrew Riminton.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Barbara as the UCSB women’s softball team hosts the Gaucho Classic this weekend. The team will face Rutgers and Pittsburgh twice over the course of Friday and Saturday before the Classic wraps up on Sunday with a game against St. Mary’s.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos enter with an overall record of 2-3 after competing in the Kajikawa Classic to open up the season. Rutgers will see its first action of the season this weekend, but finished the 2014 season with an overall record of 28-19. A dangerous Pittsburgh team will come into this one at 5-0 overall after sweeping the Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Tournament, while St. Mary’s enters with an overall record of 1-4 after the Oceanic Time Warner Cable Paradise Classic.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t have the best weekend, but our nerves are out and we are ready to compete,” senior outfielder Shelby Wisdom said. “It will be an advantage to host because we know our fields and we will have a lot more fans.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Batting has been a strong point for the Gauchos over their first five games of the season. The team has notched a total of 20 runs and currently has a total on-base percentage of .345.</p>\n<p>Junior infielder Arianna Palomares has been a bright spot for UCSB as she is hitting .313 and has already tallied four RBI on the season. Of her five hits, two have been doubles and she also scored a run in the Kajikawa Classic.</p>\n<p>Other Gauchos off to a hot start are junior catcher Samantha Stark and senior infielder Jenessa Jeppesen. Stark is currently batting .400 with two doubles already on the season. She has also driven in two runs and leads the team with five walks and an on-base percentage of .625.</p>\n<p>Jeppesen is batting .333 on the season with two runs scored and a triple to her credit. She is currently second on the team with a slugging percentage of .500.</p>\n<p>“Personally I think our team chemistry has improved,” Jeppesen said. “Our goal is to win the Big West Championship and I think we can do that this season.”</p>\n<p>While the offense has steadily contributed, pitching has proven to be a weak spot for the Gauchos. In 31 innings, the team has a total E.R.A. of 6.77 and has given up 45 runs in just five games. Junior pitcher Ashley Ludlow has the lowest E.R.A. on the team with 4.38.</p>\n<p>“As a former pitcher, I think they just need to have more confidence and hit their spots,” Wisdom said. “They may have been a little nervous, but they just need to go out there and have fun.”</p>\n<p>The tasks will not get any easier for the Gaucho pitching staff this weekend as it will face a Rutgers team that hit .301 last season and averaged 4.8 runs per game.</p>\n<p>UCSB will also have to face a Pittsburgh squad that is hitting an astounding .413 through the first five games of the season. Sophomore catcher/infielder Shelby Pickett leads the charge for Pittsburgh with 11 hits in just 17 at-bats including two home runs and 5 RBI.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos must also be very wary when facing Pittsburgh’s senior pitcher Savannah King. In three games this season she boasts an E.R.A. of 0.57 with two complete games and a shutout.</p>\n<p>St. Mary’s should provide the Gauchos a bit of relief in the Sunday finale as the team is hitting just .205 this season and the pitching staff sports a dismal E.R.A. of 9.03. Junior infielder Katelyn Mamizuka has played well, however, batting .417 with four doubles and two stolen bases.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho Classic will open with UCSB taking on Rutgers at 8:30 a.m. on Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of February 12, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Martin Cobos is a beat writer covering the UCSB softball team.
