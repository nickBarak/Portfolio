Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Two weeks ago, the No. 18 UCSB men’s soccer team played easily its worst game of the year, losing 5-2 to a Sacramento State team that currently sits in last place in the Big West North Division. Last night, thanks to a pair of trademark headers from the nation’s leading goal-scorer in junior forward Nick DePuy, the Gauchos got their revenge, taking down the Hornets 2-1 in their regular season home finale.</p>\n<p>“I’m pleased with our effort tonight,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “I thought that our players palyed a reasonably good game, especially given the bounce back from a really emotional game against Cal Poly.”</p>\n<p>At 11-5-2 overall and 6-2-1 in conference, Santa Barbara now needs a win or a tie in its season finale to hold on to first-place in the Big West North Division.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For the Hornets, the loss dropped their record to 6-9-2 overall and 3-4-1 in conference. They will need a win against Cal Poly and a UC Davis loss on Saturday to secure the final spot in the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>The seats at Harder Stadium weren’t even warm yet before DePuy got his team on the board less than two minutes into the game. After UCSB won a free kick deep in the left midfield, freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong played a long ball towards senior defender Duncan Backus at the far post.</p>\n<p>Despite a difficult angle, Backus redirected a header back across goal right where DePuy was making his run, and he knocked it in to open the scoring. The goal was the fastest scored for UCSB all season, coming just 104 seconds into the game and marking the second straight game in which DePuy has scored.</p>\n<p>The two sides provided little action until the second half, when DePuy capped off his night recording his third brace of the year. In the 53rd minute, freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong played a simple cross in from the right side towards DePuy, who rose above his defender and headed it down and in towards the far post as he has done so many times this season.</p>\n<p>“We wanted the second goal because this is a dangerous team,” Vom Steeg said. “They score a lot on free kicks, they break out really well, and they haven’t been shutout in a while, so my concern was I didn’t think one goal was going to be enough.”</p>\n<p>UCSB went up 2-0 for the second straight game, but it took just 17 seconds for the Hornets to answer back and cut the lead in half. A cross from the left wing by junior midfielder Ivan Ramirez cut through the Santa Barbara defense before senior forward Isaac Flores put away his fourth goal of the season.</p>\n<p>However, unlike when they tied Cal Poly 2-2 last Saturday, the Gauchos were able to hold on to extend their unbeaten streak to three games.</p>\n<p>“Credit to the team, we did finish this game off a little better than [against Cal Poly],” Vom Steeg said. “We took a couple balls to the corner, we made it a throw in game, we won the head balls in the box that we had to win. All those things that we did not do against Cal Poly, we did tonight.”</p>\n<p>The Big West has seen quite a few goals from the Gauchos this season, who lead the conference with 37 total, but the offensive success can be attributed mostly to DePuy, who ranks first in the nation with 15 goals and eight game-winners.</p>\n<p>“The one thing we discussed at the beginning of the season was if he wanted to pick up 15, 16 goals, he would have to work really hard in the offseason on attacking the ball and either putting it back across the box or getting it down,” Vom Steeg said. “He put the work in to be where he is right now. It’s very hard to stop him when he gets the kind of service he got today.”</p>\n<p>Picking up an assist on both of UCSB’s goals, Acheampong now has 10 for the year, three more than anyone else in the conference.</p>\n<p>“Today I think it all kind of came together,” Acheampong said. “The big guys have been open all year. It just comes down to how efficiently I can get it done and how well I’m able to find them.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos lost junior winger Ismaila Jome to injury in the first half and he did not return. Jome recently returned to the lineup after missing nearly half the season with an ankle injury.</p>\n<p>With Cal Poly drawing 0-0 against UC Davis last night, both the UCSB men’s and women’s soccer teams clinched a spot in the Big West Tournament for the first time since 2009. The Gauchos can keep the No. 1 seed, a first round bye and home-field advantage in the tournament for the third-straight year with a win or tie on Saturday or a Cal Poly loss or tie.</p>\n<p>UCSB will close out the regular season at UC Davis on Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65947\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/no-18-ucsb-defeats-sac-st-behind-more-depuy-magic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65947\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/no-18-ucsb-defeats-sac-st-behind-more-depuy-magic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/no-18-ucsb-defeats-sac-st-behind-more-depuy-magic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/no-18-ucsb-defeats-sac-st-behind-more-depuy-magic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/no-18-ucsb-defeats-sac-st-behind-more-depuy-magic/","id":1462,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1461,1460,1459],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson","biography":"Not available","articles":[121,137,246,247,249,250,342,355,358,359,360,377,378,380,384,386,390,394,397,399,400,404,405,413,415,417,418,421,428,432,435,436,438,443,445,459,460,462,463,464,466,469,475,477,480,482,483,486,495,497,498,499,500,501,505,545,599,843,967,968,971,982,984,985,986,987,988,989,990,991,992,993,994,995,1016,1017,1019,1020,1021,1023,1024,1025,1107,1147,1173,1198,1400,1462,1463,1464,1469,1470,1471,1472,1474,1476,1477,1478,1481,1482,1483,1485,1486,1487,1495,1498,1501,1502,1504,1507,1508,1509,1510,1511,1514,1516,1517,1519,1521,1523,1525,1533,1534,1535,1536,1537,1538,1543,1544,1545,1546,1547,1548,1551,1552,1553,1556,1557,1559,1985,1994,1999,2028,2033,2039,2066,3210,3219,3230,3241,3258,3285,3289,3291,3295,5051,5065,5067,5078,5083,5084,5086,5087,5090,5091,5092,5093,5094,5095,5096,5099,5100,5243,5262,5276,5277,5278,5279,5280,5281,5282,5283,5284,5285,5286,5288,5293,5305,5306,5308,5309,5312,5313],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Continue to Flourish by Trusting Guidance of Fearless Newcomers","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WomensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-25-15_8-1-web-e1446002803422.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WomensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-25-15_8-1-web-e1446002803422.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"It's been nearly six years since the UCSB women's soccer team made it into the Big West Tournament title match or the NCAA Tournament.

With this combination, the Gauchos undoubtedly deserve their recent clinching of a spot in the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>“We’re very optimistic about our program in no small part because of this group of kids,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “[Our] freshmen have not been intimidated by this collegiate environment … and what we’re asking them to do in very short order has been a pleasant surprise for us.”</p>\n<p>After losing six seniors last year and finishing the season with an overall record of 8-9-2, 2-6 in the Big West, a main focus for Stumpf heading into the off-season was rebuilding. Collaborating with Assistant Head Coach Austin Risenhoover, the two collected arguably one of the best recruiting classes in the Big West with 13 true freshmen.</p>\n<p>“We were fortunate enough to draft a recruiting class of young girls who can compete at such a high level,” Risenhoover said.</p>\n<p>Whether in overtime or late-game situations, the Gauchos’ ability to persevere has influenced Stumpf and Risenhoover, increasing their confidence in the team’s progression to the big stage and what the future holds for them.</p>\n<p>“What we’re going to benefit down the road from in these players is their experience,” Stumpf said. “The majority [of the team] are only freshmen, and after next season, they will still have two full years to play.”</p>\n<p>Among this cluster of underclassmen lies a centerpiece in freshman forward Mallory Hromatko. The first-year standout has risen to the spotlight this season, leading the Gauchos with nine goals and 22 points. It is evident that the Danville, CA native has evolved into an offensive catalyst for UCSB as her nine scores rank third in the Big West, the most among any other freshman.</p>\n<p>“It’s Mallory’s ability to work well with her teammates that’s been such a strength for her,” Risenhoover said. “Learning that forward position from older players like Amanda Ball has allowed Mallory to get comfortable on offense and naturally let her talents speak for itself.”</p>\n<p>In each of the team’s 12 matches, Hromatko has managed to score or assist. The freshman striker has been a key ingredient all season, propelling her team to two four-game winning streaks and an unbeaten stretch of six games starting in late August.</p>\n<p>“You can tell that [Mallory] trusts her teammates, and it’s translated to her success on the field,” Risenhoover said.</p>\n<p>Hromatko’s efforts have not gone unnoticed, earning herself multiple nominations and her first ever Big West Player of the Week Honors last weekend after scoring two clutch goals against UC Riverside and UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>With only three seniors on the team, forward Angelisa Cortez and forward Savannah Francis have embraced and come to understand their roles as veterans and have taken this young squad under their wings. While their minutes on the field have trimmed down, this is a sacrifice they are willing to make.</p>\n<p>“Savannah and Angelisa have been great cheerleaders on and off the field for this young unit, especially during their injuries,” Risenhoover said. “They both want what’s best for the team and are willing to do whatever it takes to get to that next level.”</p>\n<p>Following their early season injuries, Cortez and Francis have been consistent in the Gauchos’ second unit. Combined, the two have tallied a goal and two assists. Ignoring their stat lines, it is the leadership of these upperclassmen that has alluded to their success. This is where senior goalkeeper Beth Ritter comes in.</p>\n<p>“Beth has been amazing this year for us,” Risenhoover said. “Recovering from a tough injury and having [junior goalie] Jacq Caginia replace her for a couple games really added fuel to her fire, and it’s rubbed off on her teammates.”</p>\n<p>Ritter ranks among the top five goalies in the Big West with only nine goals allowed on the year and a solid .87 goals against average. Ritter’s dominant presence behind goal has taken the pressure off her teammates and granted this young team more opportunities to score.</p>\n<p>After an early non-conference skid against respected programs like Saint Mary’s and USF, UCSB has excelled and come into its own as of late. The Gauchos have won five out of their six conference matches, earning three of their five shutouts against Irvine, Hawaii and central coast rival Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>With two regular season games remaining on the schedule for Santa Barbara, this team is getting hot at the right time. Developing team chemistry is no easy task, but the seniors have embraced their role in mentoring this new generation of younger players.</p>\n<p>“We have four to six freshmen and seven to eight underclassmen starting every game this season for us,” Ritter said. “This is an exciting stat because it shows the incredibly bright future this program has in store.”</p>\n<p>As the three seniors finish their mark on the year, this young team has all the intangibles for a promising future. Now the question is: Are their talents enough for a Big West title?</p>\n<p>“All of our players have bought in to our principles of passion, accountability and commitment,” Stumpf said. “We made it this far in conference with these values; now it’s time to see how far we can go.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 17 of October 29, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65910\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/gauchos-continue-to-flourish-by-trusting-guidance-of-fearless-newcomers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65910\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/gauchos-continue-to-flourish-by-trusting-guidance-of-fearless-newcomers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/gauchos-continue-to-flourish-by-trusting-guidance-of-fearless-newcomers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/gauchos-continue-to-flourish-by-trusting-guidance-of-fearless-newcomers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/gauchos-continue-to-flourish-by-trusting-guidance-of-fearless-newcomers/","id":1459,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1458,1457,1456],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Sneaks Past CSFU With 1-0 Victory, Come Up Short in Overtime at CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WomensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-25-15_6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WomensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-25-15_6-web.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"After a critical 1-0 win over Cal State Fullerton on Thursday, it was an admirable comeback attempt by UCSB's women's soccer team in its 4-3 loss to Cal State Northridge.

Matching up against its biggest competition in hunt of the Big West title, Santa Barbara headed into Titan Stadium to face the top-ranked team in the conference in Cal State Fullerton. With both teams hosting a conference record of 5-1 in the Big West, this defensively charged match kept the two southern California squads scoreless for the first 77 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were deprived of offensive opportunities in the first half as they were held to two corner kicks and one shot on goal. Santa Barbara’s best chance at a goal came off a corner kick in the 37<sup>th</sup> minute by senior forward Savannah Francis.</p>\n<p>The fourth year from La Mirada, CA sent the ball high towards the middle of the goal box looking for her teammates but had her shot attempt snatched in mid-air by Fullerton’s redshirt junior goalkeeper Jennifer Stuart, which would be her only save of the day.</p>\n<p>The Titans controlled the majority of the match racking up nine of their total 15 shots in the first half. Redshirt senior forward Rebecca Wilson led the way accounting for seven shots on goal. Wilson has emerged as one of the conference’s elite scorers, knocking in a league best 16 goals on the year. The former Big West Player of the Year polled in six scores during the month of October, including a season-high three goals in the Titan’s 4-0 blowout over Hawaii October 11<sup>th</sup>.</p>\n<p>Heading into the second half, the score remained at a stalemate until an opportunity presented itself in the 77<sup>th</sup> minute for UCSB sophomore forward Amanda Ball. Freshman forward Mallory Hromatko found Ball down the right flank nearing the penalty box and delivered a touch pass to her teammate. With a defender right on her back, Ball made one inside cut past a diving Stuart and launched a go-ahead goal in to the bottom left of the net.</p>\n<p>Ball’s third goal since coming off of injury couldn’t have been at a better time as it handed her team the 1-0 victory. Her score helped end Stuart’s unbeaten streak of 11 games this year.</p>\n<p>Senior goalkeeper Beth Ritter played a pivotal role in Thursday’s contest, recording a season-high eight saves to shutout the Titan’s high-powered offense. Fullerton came into the match with 38 goals on the year, the most by any team in the conference.</p>\n<p>Since taking over for junior goalkeeper Jacq Caginia in their match against Long Beach State, Ritter has been the anchor on defense for UCSB. She has won seven of her eight previous starts.</p>\n<p>While it chipped away at Cal State Northridge’s early lead in Sunday’s match, UCSB came up short in its season finale. After trailing 3-0 by the end of the first half, Head Coach Paul Stumpf and his team made some adjustments, influencing the Gauchos’ aggressive attack in the second period. Attempting to spoil the Matadors’ Senior Night, UCSB scored three goals in the 57<sup>th</sup>, 64<sup>th</sup>, and 68<sup>th</sup> minute to tie the game up 3-3 and send it into overtime.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s first score came off the foot of freshman midfielder Maddie Gibson. Gibson gave that offensive spark that the Gauchos were desperately searching for, lining up to the left of the goal box about 25 yards out and sending it in the back of the net. This was Gibson’s first score of her collegiate career, putting UCSB on the board with the score 1-3.</p>\n<p>The freshman midfielder was not done yet as Hromatko connected with Gibson in the 64<sup>th</sup> minute off a cross inside the box. Gibson was in the right place at the right time, redirecting a header past senior goalkeeper Cynthia Tafoya for the 2-3 score.</p>\n<p>With the Matadors on their heels and the momentum on UCSB’s side, Ball took matters into her own hands in the 68<sup>th</sup> minute running from about 15 yards out and launching a line drive past a diving Tafoya for the 3-3 equalizer.</p>\n<p>Sending the match into extra minutes, the Gauchos looked to be the favorites during the first moments of overtime but could not capitalize on their attacks. After three corner kicks and a shot on goal by Hromatko in the 91<sup>st</sup> minute, the match ultimately came down to a penalty kick for CSUN by junior midfielder Kourtney Kutscher.</p>\n<p>Kutscher lined up for a one on one versus Ritter and sneaked a shot past the veteran goalkeeper to win the game. The overtime score was her fifth goal on the year, sending her senior teammates home with a 4-3 victory.</p>\n<p>Despite starting the year with a 0-2-1 record, UCSB now holds the No. 2 seed in the Big West Tournament. With the regular season finished, the Gauchos shift their focus onto postseason play, advancing to their first Big West Tournament since 2009. UCSB’s rematch versus third-seeded Cal State Fullerton will take place on Thursday, Nov. 5th at Titan Stadium. The semifinal match will be broadcasted on ESPN3 with a start time of 7:30 p.m.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66019\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-01/ucsb-sneaks-past-csfu-with-1-0-victory-come-up-short-in-overtime-at-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66019\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-01/ucsb-sneaks-past-csfu-with-1-0-victory-come-up-short-in-overtime-at-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-01/ucsb-sneaks-past-csfu-with-1-0-victory-come-up-short-in-overtime-at-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-01/ucsb-sneaks-past-csfu-with-1-0-victory-come-up-short-in-overtime-at-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-01/ucsb-sneaks-past-csfu-with-1-0-victory-come-up-short-in-overtime-at-csun/","id":1460,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1459,1458,1457],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Head into Postseason with No. 2 Seed","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.10.23_StephenManga_WSoccer-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.10.23_StephenManga_WSoccer-9-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"For the first time since 2009, the UCSB women's soccer team will compete in the Big West Tournament.

After pulling off the upset Thursday night against the Titans, the Matadors made sure to spoil Santa Barbara’s five-game winning streak with a 4-3 overtime win off a penalty kick from junior midfielder Kourtney Kutscher.</p>\n<p>Despite ending conference play on a bitter note, Head Coach Paul Stumpf believes the tough loss has helped prepare UCSB for its postseason matchup.</p>\n<p>“It’s good to know the team’s characters are intact [from this loss], they will fight to the end and they can score three goals in eleven minutes if the conditions are right. There definitely were some good lessons to take from [this weekend],” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Despite a one-game skid, the Gauchos have finished their season strong, winning seven of their last nine matches. Helping guide his team to its third regular season title with an overall record of 13-5-1, Stumpf claimed his second Big West Coach of the Year Award.<br>\nStumpf’s coaching and ability to pull out late-game victories has paid dividends for the team as UCSB will see its first Big West Tournament appearance since 2009. Santa Barbara is 3-3-3 overall in the conference tournament, having its previous postseason match against Cal Poly end in a 1-1 tie.</p>\n<p>UCSB is welcomed back to the tournament with the tough task of trying to contain the 2015-16 Big West Offensive Player of the year in Fullerton’s Rebecca Wilson. The redshirt senior forward has carried her team all season long, scoring 18 goals on the year, the most of any Big West player this season.</p>\n<p>Wilson led Fullerton past Cal Poly on the road last Sunday, recording both of the team’s goals in a 2-1 win. The senior has compiled 77 starts in her four years at CSFU, including five game-winning goals, tied for the sixth most in Titans’ history.</p>\n<p>In preparation of Fullerton’s high-powered offense, the Gauchos will depend on the forward duo of freshman Mallory Hromatko and sophomore Amanda Ball to lead their offensive attack. The two forwards were huge pieces in Santa Barbara’s match against Fullerton and CSUN. Hromatko assisted Ball on the game-winning goal against CSFU while Ball also scored the 3-3 equalizer to send UCSB into overtime against the Matadors.</p>\n<p>The two underclassmen have made their mark this year, combining for a total of 13 goals, eight assists and 36 points. The two landed Big West honors this past Tuesday with Hromatko being named to the First Team All-Big West and Ball to the Second Team.</p>\n<p>However, Hromatko and Ball have not been the only sources of production in the Gauchos’ success. Stumpf accredits his young group along with the leadership of upperclassmen’s supporting the team’s ability to compete at a high level.</p>\n<p>“[This team] has surprised us in how savvy they are tactically,” Stumpf said. “We can make an adjustment at half and with no practice time they are able to implement them into the game … I guess I have a little more confidence in this young team because they have just found ways to win.”</p>\n<p>The mixture of youth and experience has been a vital element in the Gauchos’ progression to the postseason. Along with Hromatko and Ball, six total players were selected to an All-Big West Team including freshman Jessica Parque, freshman Sydney Magnin, sophomore midfielder Chace Schornstein and junior defender Sydney Fuertes.</p>\n<p>“We owe a lot of our success to the older players because if they weren’t so welcoming to us freshmen, I don’t think our chemistry would be the same as it is right now,” Hromatko said. “It’s a group effort every time we step out on the field and the individual stats are not even a factor.”</p>\n<p>The keys to victory are simple for UCSB this Thursday: polish the team fundamentals they have been working on all season, and build from the positives of last week’s win against Fullerton.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we have to change [our] play at all against [Fullerton], we just have to continue what we have been doing,” Hromatko said. “We need to build off our play in the second half against them because we were able to connect more once we realized how their formations worked.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will open up its first Big West Tournament match at Titan Stadium Thursday night. Kickoff against Fullerton will commence at 7:30 p.m. While this is yet another challenge for this young team, they understand the importance of embracing the moment and not letting it slip away from them.</p>\n<p>“Our goal [this year] was to make it to the Big West Tournament,” Hromatko said. “So now it’s just about leaving everything you have out on the field because you never know when it could be our last game … we are going to come out strong Thursday and play for each other like we have been all season long.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of November 5, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66111\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/gauchos-head-into-postseason-with-no-2-seed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66111\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/gauchos-head-into-postseason-with-no-2-seed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/gauchos-head-into-postseason-with-no-2-seed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/gauchos-head-into-postseason-with-no-2-seed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/gauchos-head-into-postseason-with-no-2-seed/","id":1461,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1460,1459,1458],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
