Elections Board</em>, co-authored by UCSB 2018 graduate and former Isla Vista Party (IVP) head Nawar Nemeh and Morales, asks the Council to reconsider Morales’ disqualification as External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA).</p>\n<p>The second case, <em>Nemeh</em> v. <em>Campus United</em>, alleges that Campus United (CU) “engaged in slander” of IVP during the election. Nemeh asks that the Council remove all senators and executives who ran with CU from their current positions.</p>\n<p>The Council initially dismissed the latter case. Nemeh then filed a motion to reconsider the case, according to documents obtained by the Nexus from an anonymous source.</p>\n<p>However, the Council lost its quorum just before the 2017-2018 school year ended, leading to a paralyzing situation: Nemeh’s motion and the disqualification case cannot currently be ruled on due to the unprecedented number of vacancies.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Brooke Kopel <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/judicial-council-slots-remain-unfilled-as-senate-postpones-chair-vote/\">must make four appointments to the Council</a> before they are able to return to regular precedings. Until this occurs, these cases will remain in stasis.</p>\n<p><em>NEMEH AND MORALES </em>V.<em> ELECTIONS BOARD</em></p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Board disqualified Morales from the position of EVPSA in May when it was discovered she was not enrolled in school during spring quarter.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Legal Code, an executive candidate must be enrolled in at least six units per quarter to be eligible for office.</p>\n<p>Morales gave no comment at the time of her disqualification in mid-May.</p>\n<p>In the petition, Morales and Nemeh request that the Council overrule the disqualification and “investigate the reasoning behind the Elections Board scrutinizing the registration status of Mayela as opposed to all candidates on the ballot.”</p>\n<p>According to the petition, she challenged her academic standing with UCSB on the grounds that she had a personal emergency that required her to leave Isla Vista for a period of time.</p>\n<p>Morales and Nemeh argue the disqualification was in “blatant violation” of elections code because the board had not informed Morales of its decision soon enough.</p>\n<p>They also claim there was a partisan bias in place, calling the fact that the Board choose to focus on Morales rather than another candidate, a “peculiarity.”</p>\n<p>“The A.S. Elections Board has shown a deep disrespect for Mayela’s person, the Isla Vista Party, and the voters on campus who overwhelmingly chose her as their next External Vice President of Statewide Affairs,” the petition states.</p>\n<p>The Elections Board is currently holding a special election for the EVPSA position. However, if the Council rules in favor of Nemeh and Morales, Morales could be reinstated in her position, causing the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/madeline-loudon-is-sole-declared-candidate-for-evpsa-special-election/\">special election</a> results to become void.</p>\n<p><em>NEMEH </em>V. <em>CAMPUS UNITED</em></p>\n<p>In the petition, Nemeh alleges that CU was able to “improperly influence” the spring quarter election results through, among other matters, “engaging in slander” regarding IVP.</p>\n<p>The Nexus first heard of these allegations in mid-May and saw the evidence referenced in the case through an anonymous submitter. The Nexus was unable to pursue these allegations further at the time.</p>\n<p>The “evidence” Nemeh refers to in the petition can be seen below:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84189\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84189\" data-attachment-id=\"84189\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/petitions-regarding-a-s-spring-elections-remain-undecided-as-judicial-council-unable-to-meet-quorum/screenshots-for-article/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"screenshots for article\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-84189 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=1832%2C1374&amp;ssl=1 1832w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=1376%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84189\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of anonymous submitter </em></p></div>\n<p>Zeising and Salari could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>“In no way did CU instruct anyone to lie,” Kopel said in an interview with the Nexus. “I have no reason to believe that if the previous council dismissed the case then the new council won’t dismiss the case as well.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh declined to comment for this article.</p>\n<p>If the Council agrees to reconsider this case, and then subsequently finds CU leadership at fault for violating Student Conduct policy, then all senators and executives who ran with CU could potentially be removed from their positions.

Brown failed to support what the Senate, the Assembly, and 6 in 10 Californians already have recognized in this groundbreaking bill — that students of California need abortion care on campus,” Surina Khan, the CEO of The Women’s Foundation of California, said in a <a href=\"https://womensfoundca.org/news/governor-brown-vetoes-campus-abortion-bill/\">press release</a>.</p>\n<p>“We choose to listen to students, not those in power who continually deny their reproductive rights. We deserve a system that works for the student[s] of California.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

He was hired by UCSB in July after the previous director left following a series of controversies.</p>\n<p>The RCSGD experienced an upset during Fall Quarter 2017 when the center split from its umbrella organization, the Women, Gender &amp; Sexual Equity Department (WGSE), after its associate director Ale Muro was fired and escorted out of the building by police.</p>\n<p>RCSGD student staffers then presented a list of demands to the university, contending that they should be allowed their own autonomy in the form of a dedicated center as well an increase in funding, among other points.</p>\n<p>“I hope the school, in choosing the new director, really understood our concerns that we had the last time around, and really brought those to the hiring process this year to make sure that it won’t happen again,” said Associated Students Internal Vice President Steven Ho, who as a senator authored a resolution last year calling for the resignation of the previous director.</p>\n<p>Hikaru Ezra Mernin, who was the primary author of the demands, said the center is still suffering from a lack of trust between queer students and the RCSGD last year.</p>\n<p>“At the beginning of last year, we had several hundred [visitors]. That dropped to 50 when we had a staffing collapse, and now we have a couple dozen a day… we don’t see a lot of foot traffic,” Mernin said.</p>\n<p>Even within the center, student organizations and student staffer-led projects “fell apart” because students had to focus instead on keeping the center afloat.</p>\n<p>Mernin listed the Emerging Leadership Institute, a retreat for emerging queer leaders to foster leadership capabilities, and Society for Accessible and Safe Spaces (SASS), a trans-focused social organization, as two casualties of last year.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to get back on track now, but it’s very much a period of healing and rebuilding for our community,” they said.</p>\n<p>Mernin said they hope that Leets’s presence brings a security to the center that would allow the RCSGD to build itself back up.</p>\n<p>Leets himself came into his position fully aware of last year’s strife and wants to work with students to make amends.</p>\n<p>“If there are students who have ideas about things that the RCSGD should be doing, or ways that we can rebuild trust or mend relationships that may have been harmed or broken last year, I would love to hear from those folks,” he said.</p>\n<p>Leets specializes in LGBTQ advocacy in higher education and has had stints at PSU and Penn State University working to make sure that LGBTQ students do not face barriers at universities due to their identity.</p>\n<p>At PSU, he worked to implement a new building code that required all new and majorly renovated buildings to host all-gender, multi-stall restrooms. Leets also highlighted his efforts to make it easier for students at PSU to be recognized by their preferred names.</p>\n<p>“[We made it] so those students who don’t want to interface with their legal name don’t have to,” he said.</p>\n<p>At UCSB, Leets is working on a similar initiative that would allow students to input their own pronouns in the university system. It would then be visible on course rosters and other university databases, allowing for students to be addressed with their proper pronouns by faculty and administrators.</p>\n<p>Although there is no set timeline for its implementation yet, Leets anticipates the changes to hit campus during this academic year.</p>\n<p>There are high expectations in place for Leets as he works to return the center to the safe haven it originally was for queer students.</p>\n<p>“I came to UCSB because of the vibrancy and the cohesiveness of the queer community on campus, and very little of what I saw coming in is left,” Mernin said.</p>\n<p>Mernin says students expect the center to be more open to student input in the future and increase outreach to previously underserved communities, listing “black students, undocumented students, disabled students, lesbian students, students of faith, ACE and ARO students and intersex students.” They also want to make resources available for faculty members and graduate students.</p>\n<p>Leets seems interested in doing exactly that.</p>\n<p>“I’m just excited to continue on the legacy of other folks, particularly student activists and advocates who have done work in the past,” Leets said. “The center really has a rich legacy and LGBTQ students have been advocating on campus since the 50s, so I am just excited to be here and just continue the work that others have started.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
