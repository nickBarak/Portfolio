The 56-point route of the Kingsmen was the largest win margin in UCSB history, beating the previous mark of 55 points set against Cal Poly Pomona in 1971. The Kingsmen dropped their season opener to move to 0-1 on the year.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Amadou Sow burst out of the gate with the first seven points of the contest capped off on a feed from sophomore JaQuori McLaughlin. It didn’t take long for McLaughlin to get in on the scoring action, as he splashed a three to put the Gauchos up 10-0 after only a minute and a half of action.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sow glowed in his first game at the Thunderdome, as he finished with 15 points and a game-high 83 percent shooting from the field in a mere 14 minutes of playing time. After a half of play, Sow was 4-4 on shooting with 13 points. The Prolific Prep alum added seven boards during the short start, including five rebounds in the first half.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the floor, the Kingsmen were held to just 15.7 percent from the field as their shooting struggles plagued them throughout the night. Cal Lu posted just 21 points from field goals while they knocked down a cold 3 of 25 from three-point range.</p>\n<p>“We have to be a lockdown defensive team for us to be successful,” Head Coach Joe Pasternack expressed postgame. “My whole focus is to prepare our team to give incredible effort defensively on every single possession; the rest will take care of itself. I think we did that tonight.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos continued to pile it on with a 15-2 scoring run as UCSB led 31-8 with 10 minutes to play in the first half. Junior guard Christian Terrell and sophomore captain Devearl Ramsey spearheaded the Gaucho attack from the backcourt as the duo shot 5-7 in the first half. Terrell finished with a perfect shooting night, going 4-4 from the field while adding eight points and three steals in the process.</p>\n<p>UCSB finished off the half with an 8-2 run as Gauchos were on top 50-15 at the break. Senior forward Ami Lakoju powered the ’Chos in the final minutes of the half as he recorded 10 points in five minutes before the whistle.</p>\n<p>“I’m here to help the team and do what I can,” Lakoju stated. “I’m here to help out, and if they want to keep going to me, I’m going to put the ball up … We have help coming off the bench, and moving forward we don’t have to rely on the starting five.”</p>\n<p>The big men off the bench put on a show for the home crowd as Lakoju posted a game-high 16 points while his frontcourt counterpart, sophomore Robinson Idehen, added 10 points. Idehen and Amadou Sow combined for six blocks in the post as each of them contributed three apiece.</p>\n<p>“We really had to get the ball inside. I thought we had a big size advantage,” Pasternack asserted about his game plan. “We had to move the ball. The ball was too stagnant; we were dribbling too much against North Dakota State.”</p>\n<p>Thirsty to stack the stat sheet, the Gauchos attack featured more of the same offensive success with different faces producing. 12 out of 13 Gauchos scored a basket as the bench delivered a monstrous 53-point performance. None of the five starters played more than five minutes in the second half, as Pasternack valued the opportunity to develop the newcomers with extra playing time.</p>\n<p>“All of our guys have worked so hard in practice each day to prepare themselves,” Coach Pasternack said. “To have a deeper team really helps us. We don’t have to play 35 minutes a game like we did last year … It’s huge to be able to go 10 deep; I think it’s really going to be beneficial when we get to March.”</p>\n<p>The moment of the game came at the end of the contest when sophomore walk-on Scotty Harris contributed two baskets in the final four-minute frame as he got his first live-game court time as a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>Following the scoring spree, UCSB looks to keep the attack sharp as the 1-2 Montana State Bobcats stroll into town on Saturday afternoon at 2 p.m. to take on the 2-1 Gauchos at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84905\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-14/gauchos-overpower-cal-lutheran-in-largest-victory-in-program-history/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84905\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-14/gauchos-overpower-cal-lutheran-in-largest-victory-in-program-history/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-14/gauchos-overpower-cal-lutheran-in-largest-victory-in-program-history/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-14/gauchos-overpower-cal-lutheran-in-largest-victory-in-program-history/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-14/gauchos-overpower-cal-lutheran-in-largest-victory-in-program-history/","id":1038,"author":{"id":36,"name":"Max Kelton"},"related":[1037,1036,1035],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":36,"name":"Max Kelton","biography":"Not available","articles":[55,91,93,98,106,977,998,1001,1007,1009,1035,1038,1041,1042,1044,1045,1046,1064,1070,1077,1081,1083,1117,1125,1126,1154,1244,1247,1250,1252,1265,1270,1271,1328,1339,1341,1345,1350,1354,1355,1358,3396,4830,4833],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Have Successful Weekend in Florida","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Softball-Anna-Kodelashvili.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Softball-Anna-Kodelashvili.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB goes 3-1 at the Unconquered Classic","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB softball team traveled a long way this weekend, making its way across the country to Tallahassee, Florida to compete in the Unconquered Classic.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos made the road trip worthwhile, winning three of their four games.

This game was won in the circle with stellar performances from both sophomore pitcher Alex Pingree and senior pitcher Andriana Collins. Collins started the game and pitched four innings, only giving up one run in the process on a wild pitch. Pingree would then come into relief to pick up her first save for the team, recording four strikeouts in her two innings of play.</p>\n<p>The team’s next matchup was the first of a back-to-back with the University of Northern Iowa, which owned a record of 7-4. Santa Barbara put on a defensive clinic by once again only allowing one run in this 15-1 victory. Junior Shelby Wisdom would pick up the win and improve her ERA to 1.97.</p>\n<p>Along with great defense, the Gauchos performed incredibly on offense with a 10-run seventh inning. Freshman outfielder Kristen Clark continued to show her young talent as she led the way with three hits and three RBI’s.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had another strong defensive outing in their rematch with UNI on Saturday morning. They would again beat Northern Iowa, but this time it was no easy win, taking eight innings to put away the Panthers.</p>\n<p>Pingree was the starter and the finisher in the game, earning her third win while allowing only two runs in eight innings. Santa Barbara found itself down 2-0 in the bottom of the seventh inning, but was able to capitalize in clutch time by evening the score with a double from freshman infielder Emily Brucelas. Then in the eighth inning, senior infielder Kathryn Pilpil would seal the deal with a walk-off single into left scoring the runner from third.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara headed into its fourth game with a tournament record of 3-0, ready to take on No. 10 Florida State, the tournament’s host. The Gauchos dropped this matchup 5-2 as the Seminoles improved their record to 13-1. This was Florida State’s 13th straight win with the help of pitcher Lacey Waldrop, who carries a microscopic ERA of .50. Waldrop picked up her seventh win as she handled the Santa Barbara offense.</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos will be the Louisville Slugger Invitational, which begins Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Anna  Kodelashvili of the Daily

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In what would be their second win of the season, the UCSB women’s basketball team beat Grand Canyon by 11 points and now have an overall record of 2-6. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara was able to hold Grand Canyon to 38 percent from the field and forced 10 turnovers which made it difficult for the Lopes to find any rhythm offensively. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a quick start for UCSB as they ended the first quarter with a six-point lead. Sophomore guard Bri Anugwom provided stability on offense as she had six of her 19 points in just the first quarter. Redshirt Junior Guard Coco Miller also added two three’s to prevent the Grand Canyon defense from doubling Anugwom.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heading into this game, the Gauchos were still trying to find an identity offensively as they have struggled to score consistently. In the second quarter, the squad was able to drop 28 points through an emphasis of balanced scoring. Junior center Natalia Bruening scored the first six points in the quarter as she established herself in the post early. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After her hot start, five different ‘Chos got into the scoring action which made it difficult for the Grand Canyon defense to key in on one player. As the second quarter wrapped up, UCSB was able to outscore the Lopes by 13 points, giving them a 19-point lead heading into halftime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They would cool off offensively in the third, however, as they were only able to score 10 points in the period. Grand Canyon made it a point of emphasis to pressure the ball more to start the second half which led to easy baskets on the other end. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the common trends throughout the early season is that the squad has been unable to respond when something does not go their way in the game. Despite the increased pressure, Santa Barbara continued to remain aggressive and was undeterred when they faced adversity for the first time in the game. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grand Canyon was able to find its rhythm however, particularly in the fourth quarter as the team scored 22 points and cut their deficit to just 11 points by the end of the game. They were led by senior center Sharon Miller who had 12 points on the night, while also going 8-for-8 from the free throw line. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bruening did a terrific job for the Gauchos as she was able to limit the post touches for Miller which prevented her from making more of an impact offensively. With her confidence growing every game, she will surely be one of the team’s best players by the end of the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller has also been fantastic in the past few games as she has not only been making an impact offensively with her jumpshot but also has provided veteran leadership for the young group. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the season has gone on, UCSB has started to play with more chemistry which has led to more fluidity on both ends of the floor. Statistically, they have been able to improve their field goal percentage as a result of an increase in communication on the floor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson, it is very encouraging to see the team continue to fight and remain locked in despite their disappointing start to the season.

Now solely behind the unbeaten UC Irvine team, the Gauchos sit in an early second place in the Big West conference standings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB emerged from the gate with a three-pointer from McLaughlin, which fueled a 13-0 lead capped off by a deep dagger by sophomore guard Devearl Ramsey from beyond the arc. Only three minutes in, the ’Chos were grooving as the home crowd roared behind them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bobcats were able to cut the lead to 27-17 after a jumper from junior guard Harald Frey, which forced Coach Joe Pasternack into calling a time-out. Shortly after the break, a block by senior forward Keljin Blevins led to a transition three from junior forward Ladan Ricketts to cut the Gaucho lead to seven, which was the closest the Cats could get throughout the contest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They hit some really tough shots: tough, tough challenged threes. Ricketts, number 11 — he was four of six from three, but those were challenged threes,” Pasternack remarked on how to handle the opposing scoring runs. “We can’t worry about the score, the runs or anything else. We just have to do what we do for 40 minutes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With five minutes to play in the half, SB went on a 9-0 run as its lead elevated to 17 points following buckets from four separate Gauchos. Senior guard Tyler Hall made a push to close out the half strong and minimize the deficit as he drew a foul to convert an and-1 basket with 36 seconds left in the half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hall, a unanimous first-team All-Big Sky Conference player last season, scored a team-high 21 points in 32 minutes on 6-16 shooting from the field. His seven free throws in eight attempts were the most for either team in the non-conference matchup.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First-year point guard Sékou Touré entered the ball game for the Gauchos’ final possession of the half to splash a three from the left wing and put the Gauchos up by 16 with a 48-32 edge heading into the second half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freshman forward Amadou Sow set the tone immediately following the second-half whistle as the big man posted a four-point swing to put UCSB up by 20. Sow drew contact on a jumper to head to the line for an and-1 opportunity. After a miss from the charity stripe, Sow corralled his own rebound and finished with an emphatic slam.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Prolific Prep product aided with 11 points on 5-7 shooting while adding a game-high 8 rebounds in the process. In his first year of collegiate basketball, Sow has muscled his way into becoming one of the top five most efficient scorers in the Big West, with a 57 percent field goal percentage through four games. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ricketts was lights-out from three for the Bobcats as he hit back-to-back corner jumpers from downtown to start a 17-3 run from the Cats. He cut the lead to 10 points with a 68-58 score as Montana State attempted to claw its way back into the ball game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bobcats hoped to ride their momentum to a mighty comeback, but a quick trey from captain point guard Devearl Ramsey shut the door on a comeback as he followed it up with a coast-to-coast finish to put UCSB back on top by 16 with 5:26 left in the half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Teams go on runs; I just knew we had to regroup and just get stops again. It all comes down to our defense,” Ramsey recalled after the Bobcats’ stout comeback attempt. “When you sense a team’s making on a run, you have to bump it down and really try to get a basket. I feel like we did that well out of the time-out. Coach drew up a great play, and we executed and scored.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ramsey was the nucleus of the Gaucho charge as he dished out 8 assists and added 13 points, eight of which came in the second half. The sophomore guard put an exclamation mark on the 88-69 win with a magnificent no-look pass to senior forward Ami Lakoju under the hoop for the easy finish as time expired.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The strong homestand this past weekend delivered some home court stability for this Gaucho team as it takes to the road for the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vandal Holiday Hoops Showcase in Boise, Idaho, over Thanksgiving weekend. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84981\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-18/armond-davis-erupts-for-22-points-as-gauchos-rout-montana-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84981\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-18/armond-davis-erupts-for-22-points-as-gauchos-rout-montana-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-18/armond-davis-erupts-for-22-points-as-gauchos-rout-montana-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-18/armond-davis-erupts-for-22-points-as-gauchos-rout-montana-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-18/armond-davis-erupts-for-22-points-as-gauchos-rout-montana-state/","id":1035,"author":{"id":36,"name":"Max Kelton"},"related":[1034,1033,1032],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
