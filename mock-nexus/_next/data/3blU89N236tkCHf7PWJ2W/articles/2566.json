Around them, protesters yelled, “¡La gente unida jamás será vencida!” meaning “The people united will never be defeated!”</p>\n<p>Juan Gonzalez, fourth-year economics and accounting major, said the protest was an affirmation of human rights.</p>\n<p>“It’s obviously a good thing because we’re protesting human rights violations,” Gonzalez said. “There’s a lot of people who die trying to cross the border, trying to have a better life, and these immigration officers make it harder than it’s supposed to be, so I think it’s good to bring attention to these issues.”</p>\n<p>About three hours into the event, protesters marched into the MCC and stood in front of the CBP booth, holding up signs and wearing duct tape over their mouths, before being directed by protest organizers to return outside and continue chanting.</p>\n<p>Cox said CBP was not upset by the protest and encouraged peaceful demonstration.</p>\n<p>“They have a belief that they believe in, and they don’t necessarily believe in the mission that we are tasked to do,” Cox said. “As long as it’s a peaceful demonstration, it doesn’t bother us one bit, and we encourage people to exercise their first amendment right.”</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the event, tensions flared as a number of students with dissenting opinions arrived outside the MCC to talk with some of the protest’s supporters.</p>\n<p>Jason Garshfield, fourth-year political science major, said he felt the protest was ineffective in creating a discussion about immigration laws.</p>\n<p>“They’re angry that CBP is having a booth at the Career Fair, and I think that’s somewhat silly because those agents aren’t here to deport anyone,” Garshfield said. “I don’t totally approve of our immigration laws—I think they need to be reformed and I think that that’s a legitimate debate—but when you get 100 people together chanting the same slogan, that’s not something that’s encouraging debate.”</p>\n<p>Rick Zierer, first-year political science major, said enforcement of American borders is necessary.</p>\n<p>“In a society, you have to enforce laws, and those laws exist, be they just or unjust,” Zierer said. “There are ways that we can look about maybe making legal immigration easier. We can look at more common-sense solutions than just allowing no enforcement of the border, which potentially could be very harmful to the migrants themselves.”</p>\n<p>Alejandra Melgoza, Associated Students senator and third-year Chican@ studies and sociology double major, helped organize the event and said the protest showcased the need for the university to provide more resources to the undocumented community.</p>\n<p>“I believe we need to support the undocumented community because they need more resources on our campus,” Melgoza said. “And as a research institution, we should able to provide the services that we need for our community.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67780\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-29/students-protest-u-s-customs-and-border-protection-booth-at-career-fair/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67780\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-29/students-protest-u-s-customs-and-border-protection-booth-at-career-fair/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-29/students-protest-u-s-customs-and-border-protection-booth-at-career-fair/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-29/students-protest-u-s-customs-and-border-protection-booth-at-career-fair/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-29/students-protest-u-s-customs-and-border-protection-booth-at-career-fair/","id":2566,"author":{"id":114,"name":"Hubert Zhang"},"related":[2565,2564,2563],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":114,"name":"Hubert Zhang","biography":"Not available","articles":[2483,2529,2536,2554,2559,2566],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Ex-Student Pleads Not Guilty in 2014 Campus Rape","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02162016-Daniel-Jiang-Chen-06.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02162016-Daniel-Jiang-Chen-06.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A former UC Santa Barbara student accused of raping a woman on campus in 2014 pleaded not guilty to two felony rape charges Tuesday and will continue to be held without bail.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A former UC Santa Barbara student accused of raping a woman on campus in 2014 pleaded not guilty to two felony rape charges Tuesday and will continue to be</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">held without bail.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniel J.

food program Isla Carte is holding monthly tasting events for their proposed food cart program expected to launch in fall of 2017.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2>The student-run program is currently holding monthly tasting events to establish the menu of a proposed sustainable food cart.</h2>\n<p>Student-run food program Isla Carte is holding monthly tasting events for their proposed food cart program, with the goal of launching by Fall 2017.</p>\n<p>Isla Carte’s food cart program aims to launch another food cart on campus, similar to the Wahoo’s and Die Bretzel food carts located in the Arbor, to provide students with organic, local and sustainable food options on campus. The food cart will be primarily run by university student employees Monday through Friday and be under the same regulation as other restaurants on campus. The organization will be picking the menu based on the most popular food items sold at their monthly food tasting events.</p>\n<p>Laney Ennis, fourth-year environmental studies major, said the organization’s goal is to have generous portions with affordable prices for students.</p>\n<p>“We want it to be food that can fill somebody up,” Ennis said. “Our number one priority is that it’s local, and we make sure that everything we use is organic.”</p>\n<p>Ennis said she took over Isla Carte after the organization’s leaders graduated last year, to provide students with healthy and local food options.</p>\n<p>“A lot of our farming system is really messed up and really dominated by these huge corporations,” Ennis said. “I really wanted to do something that brings back local farms and more sustainable agriculture and gives students an on-campus option for that.”</p>\n<p>Ennis said one of the organization’s goals is to lower prices for sustainable food through seasonal shopping to avoid paying extra for imported foods, cutting back on meat and buying “ugly” fruits and vegetables.</p>\n<p>“It really doesn’t have to be more expensive and we’re basically going to be doing the work for you,” Ennis said. “We’re going to be looking at what the cheapest sustainable foods are, because we really want to bring prices down to something that all students can afford.”</p>\n<p>Ennis said while most of their food is sourced from I.V. Co-op, Isla Carte is trying to build relationships with local farmers.</p>\n<p>“When we think about what we want to serve, there are so many aspects to look at. You can look at water use, how far it had to be transported, what chemical fertilizers they’re using,” Ennis said. “That’s where a lot of the thinking and menu-planning has to come in. We can do that so you don’t have to.”</p>\n<p>Austen Trout, second-year physics major, said he respects the group’s mission but personally does not care about the origins of his food ingredients.</p>\n<p>“It seems like they have good intentions, and they’re trying to do something that is unique,” Trout said. “As long as my food doesn’t kill me, I’m fine with it. I’m not that picky about where it comes from or who made it.”</p>\n<p>Michael Lin, second-year theater major, said the most accessible eating choice for sustainable food is the dining commons.</p>\n<p>“The dining commons have taken strides to becoming healthier and more sustainable, but going another full step forward would be great … if it’s maybe cheaper than the dining meal plans,” Lin said.</p>\n<p>Alexa Rogalski, second-year biology major, said she thinks the food cart is a “great idea” and will broaden the selection of food available on campus.</p>\n<p>“It’s a good option for people who don’t like the food on campus. I don’t feel like the food on campus is really healthy, so having a healthy option would be awesome,” Rogalski said. “If it’s sustainable that’s an even bigger plus.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Jan 28, 2016 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67746\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/isla-carte-provides-free-monthly-food-tastings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67746\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/isla-carte-provides-free-monthly-food-tastings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/isla-carte-provides-free-monthly-food-tastings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/isla-carte-provides-free-monthly-food-tastings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/isla-carte-provides-free-monthly-food-tastings/","id":2563,"author":{"id":112,"name":"Natalie Overton"},"related":[2562,2561,2560],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Academic Senate Meets to Discuss Campus Issues","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-01-31T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/UCSB-Academic-Senate.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/UCSB-Academic-Senate.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The bi-quarterly Academic Senate met Thursday night in the UCen State Street room to update the faculty on campus issues.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The bi-quarterly Academic Senate met Thursday night in the UCen State Street room to update the faculty on campus issues.</p>\n<p>The meeting included reports on happenings such as new professors and Fall 2016 application rates.</p>\n<p>UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang recognized the passing of UCSB faculty members, including Otis Madison, a professor in the Department of Black Studies, and said Madison’s time at UCSB was impactful.</p>\n<p>“He lectured on campus for almost 40 years and was very inspiring,” Yang said. “People remember him very well.”</p>\n<p>Yang also took the time to recognize the passing of important alumnus Jim Barber, who is responsible for the idea of the Gaucho Reunion, a sort of homecoming weekend that over 10,000 UCSB alumni attend annually.</p>\n<p>According to Yang, the application rates for incoming 2016 freshmen were the highest and most competitive to date. Yang called the freshman application pool the “most important item” of the meeting.</p>\n<p>Yang attributed lower past application rates to the events of May 23 in 2014, but said that the increase in this year’s applicants demonstrates that the school’s reputation is recovering.</p>\n<p>“This is something we have been focusing our efforts towards and represents a victory for us,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>Yang said the number of applicants increased 9.3 percent from last year, a remarkable rise compared to the rest of the UC campuses.</p>\n<p>“[This is] the highest increase in applicants — aside from Merced, which is still growing — among all UC campuses,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>There were a total of 77,090 applicants for Fall 2016, 42 percent of which had a high school GPA of 4.0 or higher.</p>\n<p>Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn spoke on a variety of initiatives, including the integration of a transfer student support center on campus that will be in the new library.</p>\n<p>Klawunn said she is proud of UCSB’s diversity.</p>\n<p>“One of the things that excited me most about coming to work at UCSB was the dedication the faculty puts forth to encourage full diversity of the student body,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>Academic Senate Chair Kum-Kum Bhavnani discussed Wednesday’s Associated Students Senate meeting, the UC Board of Regents proposal to increase off-campus housing funding and nonresident tuition costs, for which a bill is currently being drafted.</p>\n<p>Bhavnani said the Board of Regents has worked with UC campuses to complete projects.</p>\n<p>“Word on the street is, if the Regents can handle all the complications of UCLA’s structures, then it can handle us,” Bhavnani said.</p>\n<p>The Academic Senate will hold its next meeting in early March.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67812\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-31/academic-senate-meets-to-discuss-campus-issues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67812\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-31/academic-senate-meets-to-discuss-campus-issues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-31/academic-senate-meets-to-discuss-campus-issues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-31/academic-senate-meets-to-discuss-campus-issues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-31/academic-senate-meets-to-discuss-campus-issues/","id":2565,"author":{"id":116,"name":"Madison Hechler"},"related":[2564,2563,2562],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
