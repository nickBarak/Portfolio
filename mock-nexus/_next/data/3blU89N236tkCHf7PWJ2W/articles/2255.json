Renteria said voting for the special election will begin on Oct. 15 at 8 a.m. and will close on Oc. 18. The board will announce the results the same night.</p>\n<p>All candidates who ran in the spring election will be eligible to run for the position of EVPSA in the fall election, Renteria said. However, candidates must run independently rather than with a political party.</p>\n<p>The meeting was adjourned before the senators could accept the board’s minutes.</p>\n<p>“My senate is not cooperating with me,” Ho said after the senators failed to approve the Elections Board minutes for the second time.</p>\n<p>The Senate’s approval of the minutes, however, is a formality, so Election Board’s decision to disqualify Morales remains legitimate.</p>\n<p>The meeting ended just after 5:30 p.m. with more than a quarter of the agenda left unaddressed because another group needed the State Street Room for a meeting.</p>\n<p><em>Simren Verma contributed reporting.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Pahl.</em></p></div>\n<p>Annie Wang is a second-year psychology major and member of the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity. Wang was last seen Friday morning around 4 a.m., according to Bryant Pahl, a third-year earth science major and Alpha Phi Omega Chapter president.</p>\n<p>A missing persons report was filed for Wang around 9:40 a.m. on Monday morning, according to Charlene Wu, one of Wang’s current housemates in Manzanita Village.</p>\n<p>“Her roommates last saw her at 3 a.m. studying in the dorms, but did not see her the next morning,” Pahl said. “The last message she sent [was] to her little in Alpha Phi Omega at 3:54 a.m.”</p>\n<p>Pahl said the location on her phone is currently off and said he believes her phone is “either dead or turned off.”</p>\n<p>Wang was last seen at an Alpha Phi Omega affiliated event during the fraternity’s general meeting on May 15, Pahl said. Alpha Phi Omega is a co-ed service-based fraternity.</p>\n<p>“She signed up for several service events during the weekend but did not attend any, which is a rare behavior for Annie as she is a very prominent servant leader. In fact, she currently has the most service hours in the fraternity,” Pahl said.</p>\n<p>Several people have posted notices about Wang’s disappearance on the UCSB Free &amp; For Sale Facebook page and other social media sites.</p>\n<p>Wang was later <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-22/missing-ucsb-student-found-deceased-in-santa-ynez-mountains/\">found deceased</a> in the Santa Ynez Mountains, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO).</p>\n<p>Her friends set up a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/love-for-annie\">GoFundMe</a> on Wednesday to help her family with funeral expenses, according to the webpage.</p>\n<p><em>Updated: This article was updated to include information from SBSO.</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated: This article was updated to include information about the GoFundMe.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

As part of her position, Kiser guides KCSB’s decision-making processes and ensures compliance with KCSB’s policies, according to the A.S. job’s description.</p>\n<p>The motion of “no confidence in Jennifer Kiser’s ability to adequately perform in her current position as Assistant Director of Independent Media or in any position within or representing KCSB” passed with a unanimous 16-0 vote, according to KCSB’s May 29 meeting minutes.</p>\n<p>Kiser could not be reached for requests for comment.</p>\n<p>Kiser is an ex-officio member of the KCSB executive committee, a group comprised of 17 student managers who oversee KCSB finances, projects and policies. Multiple A.S. permanent staff members, including Kiser, work within the station in various capacities.</p>\n<p>The committee motioned to move the meeting to a closed session to discuss the vote of no confidence. Members voted to keep internal notes about the discussion instead of drafting public minutes. Only KCSB staff can view the notes.</p>\n<p>KCSB advisor Ted Coe left the meeting before the discussion.</p>\n<p>“If we’re talking about one of my colleagues, and she’s not here, I don’t think I should be in<br>\nthis conversation,” Coe said at the meeting.</p>\n<p>Miles Bishop, KCSB general manager, declined to comment on the vote of no confidence. Bishop became general manager of the station in January after the resignation of fourth-year feminist studies major Megan Neikirk.</p>\n<p>Marisela Marquez, executive director of A.S., also declined to comment on the vote.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83546\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-15/kcsb-passes-vote-of-no-confidence-for-a-s-staff-member/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83546\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-15/kcsb-passes-vote-of-no-confidence-for-a-s-staff-member/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-15/kcsb-passes-vote-of-no-confidence-for-a-s-staff-member/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-15/kcsb-passes-vote-of-no-confidence-for-a-s-staff-member/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-15/kcsb-passes-vote-of-no-confidence-for-a-s-staff-member/","id":2253,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2252,2251,2250],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
