Carney’s research focuses specifically on the effects of food insecurity on women who migrate to the United States from Mexico and Central America.</p>\n<p>According to Carney, these women experience unique consequences of displacement.</p>\n<p>“Women from these communities have faced a unique set of challenges,” Carney said. “Women’s decision to migrate may exhibit a desire to uphold social obligations in the realm of food.”</p>\n<p>Carney said the globalization of trade and neoliberal policies have caused food insecurity and subsequently displaced many agrarian communities from Mexico and Central America.</p>\n<p>“The North American Free Trade Agreement serves as a prime example of legislation that have displaced many rural Mexican farmers because of their occupation, because they are unable to compete with subsidized produce,” Carney said.</p>\n<p>Carney also said food insecurity is a result of structural readjustments to food and trade that come with neoliberal policy.</p>\n<p>“Food insecurity is a palpable consequence of policy shifts and represents the depriving politics of the state,” Carney said. “States often do the depriving intentionally or unintentionally.”</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Jade Burchett said the lecture explained undocumented migrants’ challenges and motivations and showed that migration is a complex issue.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67343\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67343\" data-attachment-id=\"67343\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/professor-megan-carney-lectures-on-migration-food-insecurity/megan-carney_-by-lorenzo-basilio-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452615024\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Megan Carney_ by Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67343\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x684.jpg?resize=800%2C534\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67343\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I liked that the lecture showed the perspective of a group of people who are so stigmatized,” Burchett said. “Often, people belittle migrants by calling them ‘illegal’ and question their motives for crossing the border. This talk showed their motives and how it’s almost necessary for them to migrate.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Chican@ studies major Jorge Gonzalez said the lecture highlighted the struggle many migrant families face trying to provide nutritious meals during economic hardship.</p>\n<p>“Due to their unauthorized status, they don’t have access to many jobs and often end up working jobs that only give them 20 minutes to an hour to prepare meals,” Gonzalez said. “Because they don’t have time to prepare meals, these families often use prepared food, which has health consequences.”</p>\n<p>Carney said the food financially available to most migrant families is very unhealthy.</p>\n<p>“Many of my key informants perceived the abundance of ‘comida chattara,’ or junk food, in the United States as jeopardizing the efforts of migrants to maintain healthy diets for their family members,” Carney said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Food Bank and CalFresh Representative Amy Lopez said the Food Bank offers services to the families in Santa Barbara County that face food insecurity.</p>\n<p>“The Food Bank of Santa Barbara County is a nonprofit organization that distributes food to people in need and empowers people with nutrition education,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>To learn more about food insecurity and resources for families in Santa Barbara County, visit Santa Barbara Food Bank’s website at <em><a href=\"http://www.foodbank.sbc.org\">www.foodbank.sbc.org</a>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67352\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/professor-megan-carney-lectures-on-migration-food-insecurity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67352\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/professor-megan-carney-lectures-on-migration-food-insecurity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/professor-megan-carney-lectures-on-migration-food-insecurity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/professor-megan-carney-lectures-on-migration-food-insecurity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/professor-megan-carney-lectures-on-migration-food-insecurity/","id":2572,"author":{"id":127,"name":"Amy Koo"},"related":[2571,2570,2569],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":127,"name":"Amy Koo","biography":"Not available","articles":[2532,2553,2572,2583,2594,2608,2634,2641,2651,2656,2663,2681,3868,4615],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Senate appointed two new on-campus senators, first-year students Reilly Hobson and Batsheva Labowe-Stoll, Wednesday night in the Flying A Room of the UCen.</p>\n<p>Several senators alleged at the meeting that A.S. violated the Legal Code in the process of choosing the candidates. Hobson and Labowe-Stolle will fill two open on-campus positions, one of which was left vacant by second-year art history major Lacy Wright, who resigned in Fall Quarter.</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator Stevan Abdalmalik, a third-year political science major, said A.S. Internal Vice President (IVP) Kimia Hashemian, a fourth-year sociology major, violated the policy of IVP neutrality because she voted for the selection of the senators.</p>\n<p>“Just like the IVP doesn’t vote in senate, they should not vote in that committee,” Abdalmalik said. “The IVP … should have not voted in that committee, and the vote was cast.”</p>\n<p>Abdalmalik said selection committee leadership supported specific candidates.</p>\n<p>“It seems to me, through the committee’s term, there have been certain biases towards certain candidates by the leadership of the committee, because the violations are factually based and backed by legal code,” Abdalmalik said.</p>\n<p>Abdalmalik also said the committee leaders should not have had access to the names of candidates.</p>\n<p>“The chair and the vice chair were given special privileges of information in knowing the names of the candidates,” Abdalmalik said. “Then they used the names of the candidates, which were barred from all other senate committee members, in order to base their votes.”</p>\n<p>On-campus Senator Nawar Nemeh, a second-year economics and political science double-major, said the search committee failed to submit a conflict of interest form during the selection process.</p>\n<p>Nemeh referred to <a href=\"https://www.as.ucsb.edu/resources/codes-policies/\" target=\"_blank\">Policy 15 of the Legal Code</a>, which says, in part, “all voting members are personally charged with the responsibility of bringing any personal interests said member(s) may have in the outcome(s) of said vote(s).”</p>\n<p>Nemeh said the committee members did not fill out the conflict of interest forms, which outline whether members know any of the candidates, have personal relationships with them, are in any organization with them and if members “would benefit in any way from [the senators] being appointed.”</p>\n<p>“Our committee didn’t fill out this form even though the Legal Code clearly says that we have to fill out this form if we are to appoint a new member,” Nemeh said.</p>\n<p>On-campus senator and second-year political science major Mercedes Rodriguez said she believes there were no transparency issues in the appointment of the two new senators.</p>\n<p>“If there was a lack of transparency, I would blame [senators] for not going because the meetings were open,” Rodriguez said. “[Senator Nikki Elyasi] was pretty transparent throughout the senate meetings about what we did. I don’t think there was anything wrong with how the process went.”</p>\n<p>The two senators were appointed in a hand vote of 13 for and five against. Four members abstained from the vote. Shortly after the vote, Nemeh and Abdamalik left the meeting early, seemingly in a statement of disapproval.</p>\n<p>Also at the meeting, Off-campus Senator Jerel Constantino, a third-year history of public policy and political science double-major, revealed the “2016 A.S. Referenda Reform” website. The purpose of the reform and website are to increase transparency with A.S. for voters, according to Constantino.</p>\n<p>“My main point is I want the students to be more informed about their fees,” Constantino said.</p>\n<p>To learn more, visit the website at <a href=\"https://asfb.as.ucsb.edu/16reform/\">asfb.as.ucsb.edu/16reform/</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67250\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/a-s-welcomes-new-senators-allegedly-violating-legal-code/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67250\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/a-s-welcomes-new-senators-allegedly-violating-legal-code/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/a-s-welcomes-new-senators-allegedly-violating-legal-code/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/a-s-welcomes-new-senators-allegedly-violating-legal-code/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/a-s-welcomes-new-senators-allegedly-violating-legal-code/","id":2571,"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez"},"related":[2570,2569,2568],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Former UCSB Student Files Title IX Lawsuit Against UC Regents","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Mastres_StorkePanorama.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Mastres_StorkePanorama.jpg?resize=471%2C289&ssl=1","description":"Former UCSB student Haley Moore filed a Title IX Civil Lawsuit against the Regents of the University of California on Thursday, claiming UCSB failed to adequately address and investigate her case afte...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Former UCSB student Haley Moore filed a Title IX Civil Lawsuit against the Regents of the University of California on Thursday, claiming UCSB failed to adequately address and investigate her case after receiving the complaints in October 2014.</p>\n<p>Moore’s civil action case is based on “Gender Discrimination” under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, a federal statute that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any education program or activity that receives federal funding. According to the plaintiff, she suffered the loss of educational opportunities after being sexually assaulted in October 2014, ultimately being forced to withdraw from the university in January 2015 due to “deliberate indifference” on the part of the university.</p>\n<p>According to the case, Moore’s cousin reported the sexual assault to the police the morning after the incident. Moore provided a statement to UCPD and went to Campus Advocacy Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.) the next day to schedule a counseling session. After Moore received a session with an intern seven to 10 days later, Moore’s father contacted Marisa Huston, Assistant Coordinator of Student Mental Health Services and requested his daughter be able to promptly meet with an experienced counselor. Moore met with Huston two to three days later and was allegedly made to wait 10 minutes and told that Huston was not obligated to the keep the contents of the meeting confidential. During this counseling session, Moore expressed concern about losing her financial aid and student housing if she dropped classes and was told by Huston that these could both be potential problems.</p>\n<p>The case states Kirsten Olson, the Assistant Clinical Director and Administrative Services Coordinator called Moore three to four days after the counseling session and scheduled a meeting for a few days later.</p>\n<p>“At the meeting, Olson immediately began talking to Moore about her grades. She asked Moore if Moore had considered withdrawing from UCSB. Moore informed Olson that she did not want to withdraw. Olson responded by questioning Moore’s decision not to withdraw, and informed Moore that there were counseling measures Moore could engage in during the time she was withdrawn from UCSB,” the case states.</p>\n<p>According to the case, Moore also had a phone call with Joe O’Brien, Assistant Dean and Director of Advising at UCSB, and was told that if she reduced her course load, she would be ineligible for both financial aid and UCSB housing. Moore also made efforts to switch her counselor at C.A.R.E., but ran into several roadblocks.</p>\n<p>In January 2015, Moore received a letter from UCSB informing her of academic probation due to poor academic performance during her first quarter at UCSB. In late January, four months after first reporting her assault to UCSB, Moore withdrew from the university.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff alleges that UCSB’s Title IX coordinator was never informed of her sexual assault report and that she was not provided adequate or timely counseling from C.A.R.E. after the sexual assault. Moore’s case also claims UCSB did not take any action to investigate Moore’s report of sexual assault by another UCSB student after she expressed a desire for some “remedial action” to be taken with regard to her report. In response to this request, the university allegedly told Moore an investigation would take a long time, be difficult emotionally and distract Moore from her studies. She was also told a school investigation would likely interfere with, and possibly even sabotage, the criminal investigation of Moore’s assault.</p>\n<p>The case also states Moore encountered the perpetrator of her sexual assault at least one time on campus after the incident, causing Moore to quickly leave the area after suffering a panic attack.</p>\n<p>“The mere presence on campus, without any restrictions, of the student that sexually assaulted Moore made Moore vulnerable to additional harassment and further exposed her to a sexually hostile environment,” the case states.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff also claims she was deprived of several education opportunities, including but not limited to: a drop in her GPA, withdrawal from several classes, avoidance of several social activities on campus, the need to seek multiple accommodations from UCSB and eventual withdrawal from UCSB.</p>\n<p>“As a result of Defendant Trustees’ deliberate indifference, Plaintiff suffered loss of educational opportunities and/or benefits, has incurred and will continue to incur attorney fees and costs of litigation,” the case states.</p>\n<p>UCSB and the University of California Office of the President were both unable to comment, stating the case is currently pending litigation.</p>\n<p>UCSB Public Affairs office said while they could not comment on the case, the safety and well-being of students is the university’s highest priority, and students’ cases are treated with care and confidential advocacy.</p>\n<p>“If the student chooses to formally report their assault to the University, the allegations are thoroughly investigated and adjudicated in accordance with UC policy and government guidelines. We strive to ensure that our investigative processes are survivor-centered, but we understand that not every survivor opts to formally report their assault. In all cases we continue to offer support and counseling to assault survivors, as the safety and well-being of our students is our highest priority,” the statement reads.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66990\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-17/former-ucsb-student-files-title-ix-lawsuit-against-uc-regents/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66990\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-17/former-ucsb-student-files-title-ix-lawsuit-against-uc-regents/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-17/former-ucsb-student-files-title-ix-lawsuit-against-uc-regents/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-17/former-ucsb-student-files-title-ix-lawsuit-against-uc-regents/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-17/former-ucsb-student-files-title-ix-lawsuit-against-uc-regents/","id":2569,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2568,2567,2566],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Brainstorm for the Rainstorm","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Rain-1-1-e1452236193910.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Rain-1-1-e1452236193910.jpg?resize=500%2C330&ssl=1","description":"As UCSB students walked to class this morning clad in rubber boots and rain jackets and carrying umbrellas for extra measure, they took a look around at their fellow Gauchos.

The Nexus reccommends wearing proper footwear and leaving extra early for class, amongst other helpful tips. <em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>As UCSB students walked to class this morning clad in rubber boots and rain jackets and carrying umbrellas for extra measure, they took a look around at their fellow Gauchos. The look on everyone’s face read one word: misery. The bikers were wiping rain (or were they tears?) off their faces; the walkers were trying to keep their umbrellas intact against the ferocious wind. Everyone was asking one big question: “How do I become more waterproof?”</p>\n<p>The answer is in genetics. We are Santa Barbarans and, more importantly, we are Southern Californians. Our people have lived for ages in the land of deserts and droughts, and when the words “El Niño” come up, we start to shake in our flip flops.</p>\n<p>So, here are some rain tips for all you Gauchos as you brave El Niño and any other wet conditions you may endure in your young lives.</p>\n<h4>Stay Dry:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The best shoes for wet weather are any type of rain boot, such as Hunter or L.L. Bean. If you don’t want to spend too much money, an old pair of Converse will get you across campus and back to Isla Vista with minimal damage.</li>\n<li>Waterproof jackets are essential whether you have an umbrella or not. For bikers, if you do not have a bike seat cover, wear a longer jacket to separate you from that wet bike seat after your 10 a.m. lecture.</li>\n<li>Dress in layers. The worst that could happen is being dressed for winter in Seattle and, by midday, it’s summer in San Diego.</li>\n<li>The skies are gray … so wear something colorful! You could brighten your day and even someone else’s.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Protect Your Home:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Check your roof for sagging and dark spots. If you see outside light coming in, you might end up with a messy leak all over your living room floor.</li>\n<li>Call your landlord immediately if you see signs of damage so you can fix the problems before the rain continues.</li>\n<li>Grab yourself some buckets. If you have leaks already, put a bucket underneath them to prevent the rain from ruining your floors. When the bucket fills up with water, go find a garden to water.</li>\n<li>Be watchful of erosion on cliffside homes.</li>\n<li>Clean your gutters of leaves and dirt, and make sure there is a clear path for water to flow.</li>\n<li>Cover outdoor furniture to prevent damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Bike Safely:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Give yourself extra time before heading to class so you can be cautious of slick bike paths and other bikers.</li>\n<li>Cover your bike seat with a plastic bag. Bring a couple extras with you just in case it rains while you’re in class.</li>\n<li>Be wary of rainbow patches on the bike paths. While they might look pretty, remember that they are built-up oil puddles, and they’re slick.</li>\n<li>Avoid puddles. Save yourself and everyone around you. Please.</li>\n<li>Cherish the knowing glances between you and other bikers as you make that adventure from the 67 block of Trigo to your lecture in the Chem building. You’re all in this together.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Have Fun:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy popcorn and hot chocolate, and sit down with your favorite Netflix series when it looks too unbearable to venture outside.</li>\n<li>If you can, enjoy it. Jump in puddles, slide through the mud and catch raindrops on your tongue. Who knows when it’ll rain like this again?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, January 7, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67227\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/brainstorm-for-the-rainstorm/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67227\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/brainstorm-for-the-rainstorm/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/brainstorm-for-the-rainstorm/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/brainstorm-for-the-rainstorm/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/brainstorm-for-the-rainstorm/","id":2570,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2569,2568,2567],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
