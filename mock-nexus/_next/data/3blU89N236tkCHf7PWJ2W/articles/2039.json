Even for an exceedingly successful No. 1 pick like Andrew Luck, who through three years has already broken a number of records and brought the Indianapolis Colts back to the AFC title game twice as fast as his legendary predecessor did, his legacy will likely never completely outgrow the record-book sized shadow left by Peyton Manning.</p>\n<p>Hell, even Peyton’s legacy isn’t the prettiest. No matter how many records he breaks, at this point he’ll most likely never be able to say he has as many Super Bowl rings as his little brother Eli.</p>\n<p>So then, what does this Sunday mean for a guy like Tom Brady?</p>\n<p>Well, let’s refresh our memories for a second, because while Brady may be the league’s all-time winningest playoff quarterback, “All I Do Is Win” is not actually his theme song … though I wouldn’t be surprised if it were his ringtone.</p>\n<p>The wily 15-year vet has not won a Super Bowl since 2004, when he and his good pal Bill Belichick defeated the Philadelphia Eagles to win their ninth-consecutive playoff game and earn their third championship in four years.</p>\n<p>It’s been quite a journey for Brady since his triumphant entrance to the league. A number of first-round byes, two league MVPs, a severe season-ending knee injury while at the peak of his powers, a bunch of ridiculous touchdowns to Randy Moss and Rob Gronkowski and oh yeah … a 0-2 record in Super Bowls, with both losses coming to the New York Giants.</p>\n<p>If not for Peyton’s annoying little brother and David Tyree’s sticky helmet, Brady would probably be a much more obvious choice in the “greatest QB of all time” conversation. However, while just about everything has gone right for the NFL’s golden boy, from his Cinderella-like beginnings to his supermodel wife and maybe even one or two of his Ugg commercials, he still doesn’t have that fourth ring. Where’s Pau Gasol when you need him? … On second thought, those Ugg commercials are just bad.</p>\n<p>Yes, another ring would be fantastic. It would put Tom at the top of perhaps the most important list there is, alongside Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw in the four-timers club. But rather than thinking about how nice it would be to have so much bling you can justify putting a ring on your pinky, let’s think about what it would mean if Sunday doesn’t go Tom’s way.</p>\n<p>Another Super Bowl loss would make Brady a measly .500 all-time in the biggest game there is. It would give Russell Wilson his second ring in just his third year, making him the “new Tom Brady” of the league. It would mean no rings in 11 years, despite nine first-round byes and a ridiculous 20-7 postseason record.</p>\n<p>While I personally used to despise the guy ever since the infamous “Tuck Rule” incident, which forever branded him as a cheater in my childish brain (thanks, Spygate, for making it a reality), it is hard not to respect him for being the great winner and leader that he is. For someone as fiercely competitive as Tom Brady, failure is never an option. Even at 37 years old, anyone can still see the fire in his eyes every time he walks on the field.</p>\n<p>With a win, Brady will cement his place in history as one of the best of the best of the best. His career will have been brought full-circle, with championship banners spanning from one generation of football to the next. He will be forever remembered as one of the greatest competitors and winners the NFL has ever seen.</p>\n<p>With another loss, whether he deserves it or not, Brady will forever be remembered not as the guy who won three straight Super Bowls, but also as someone who lost three straight. Even for me, a Patriots hater, that seems like a pretty unfair legacy to have.</p>\n<p>No matter what happens though, can we just stop talking about Deflategate? Please?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Seahawks Making Their Mark on History</strong> by Edward Moss</p>\n<p>It’s the Seahawks versus the Patriots. The reigning champion versus the most recent dynasty. Carroll versus Belichick. Brady versus Wilson. Who would be the more fitting victor, the team that won three Super Bowls in four years but has lost in two championship games since, or the squad looking to add a chapter to a possible dynasty with a second straight title? Looking at the Seattle Seahawks, a win on Sunday could put this team on the verge of a new dynasty while acknowledging one of the greatest defensive teams of all-time.</p>\n<p>Russell Wilson, the starting quarterback of the reigning Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks has already had an amazingly successful career. One of the most successful third-round draft picks ever, last season he led his team to a 13-3 record in the regular season and a Super Bowl Championship over the Denver Broncos, 43-8. He is the shortest quarterback to ever win a Super Bowl at 5’11” and now after his team went 12-4 in the regular season and beat the Carolina Panthers and Green Bay Packers to get to the title game, he has a shot to win his second championship before his 27th birthday.</p>\n<p>Pete Carroll enjoyed success at USC before becoming the Seahawks’ head coach in 2010. He won two national championships with the Trojans and after winning the Super Bowl last season, he is one of three coaches to win both a college national championship and a Super Bowl.</p>\n<p>At 62, Carroll was the third oldest coach to win a Super Bowl and he is attempting to become the 14th head coach to win multiple Super Bowl Championships.</p>\n<p>With a victory, Wilson and Carroll would be put into a similar conversation as Brady and Belichick as winning quarterback-head coach combos. A win would put them one Super Bowl victory behind the Patriots’ tandem, and this is a team that could be perennial contenders for years to come. We may be watching the second chapter in a future dynasty for the Seattle Seahawks and one of the more successful quarterback-head coach partnerships in NFL history.</p>\n<p>But the Seahawks didn’t win last year’s championship or get back to the Super Bowl this year just through its offense. This team has what is widely regarded as the best defense in the league. This defense finished first in the league in points allowed for the third straight season and had the second largest point differential in the league for the second straight year. Led by perennial Pro Bowlers cornerback Richard Sherman, free safety Earl Thomas and strong safety Kam Chancellor, this defensive squad has the ability to shut down any offense in the league</p>\n<p>A win for the Seahawks would put them on the road to a dynasty. However, they are going up against the last team to win back-to-back Super Bowl championships, and a quarterback-head coach tandem that has lost its last two championship games and is desperate to end that streak.</p>\n<p>It won’t be easy for Seattle, but they have the opportunity to knock off the greatest franchise of the 21st century and put their name in the conversation to take over that accolade.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of January 29, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Eric Swenson/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>It was a routine play that any volleyball player would have tried to make, but when Kevin Donohue dove for a shanked ball against USC two years ago, he hit the ground awkwardly and came out of the play with a dislocated shoulder, a torn labrum and a partially torn rotator cuff. Donohue was a redshirt sophomore at the time, just starting to earn consistent playing time in successive matches when all of a sudden, his season ended on one bad dive.</p>\n<p>Many other players would have had a negative attitude about the injury, but the economics and accounting major Donohue saw it as another obstacle to climb in order to become a better volleyball player. And now, as a co-captain in his senior season, he hopes to lead the Gauchos to a national championship.</p>\n<p>“Kevin does all the right things on and off the court. He is our captain and our emotional leader,” Assistant Coach Cullen Irons said. “He does everything he possibly can do to find success and we are happy to have that in Kevin.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The injury wasn’t Donohue’s first obstacle he had to overcome in order to become the player he is today. As a 6’3” outside hitter/opposite, he is consistently one of the shortest players on the court.</p>\n<p>In high school, Donohue was the star player of a Mira Costa High School volleyball team that won four Bay League Championships, as well as a CIF championship in 2008 and a California State championship in 2010; however, even with all of the success, it didn’t look like Donohue was going to have the opportunity to play volleyball in college until the summer after his senior year.</p>\n<p>It was during his club team’s run to a gold medal at the Junior Olympics his senior year that UCSB Head Coach Rick McLaughlin offered Donohue a walk on spot on the NCAA team only two months before enrolling in the school. Donohue was overcome with excitement and he knew that the opportunity was not one he would take for granted.</p>\n<p>“I knew being an undersized opposite at 6’3” that my options for playing in college would be limited,” Donohue said. “I didn’t try to worry too much about it; I knew that if my teams were winning and if I was doing well then something great would happen.”</p>\n<p>Sitting on the bench as a redshirt his first year of college, Donohue had the opportunity to watch the UCSB men’s volleyball team go on a historic run to the national championship game. Though the season ended in heartbreak, Donohue learned so much from the older players. He has been passing down this wisdom to younger players ever since.</p>\n<p>In his freshman season, Donohue garnered limited playing time, and it was in his sophomore season that he started becoming a force on the court after learning how to play as an outside hitter and having to pass on every serve receive. But in one play, the success and playing time vanished.</p>\n<p>With a dislocated shoulder, a torn labrum, and a partially torn rotator cuff, Donohue’s shoulder was basically useless right after the injury. He missed the remainder of his sophomore season and worked throughout the summer and fall in order to get back on the team his junior year.</p>\n<p>It was a frustrating time for Donohue, however, as he would go in waves of his arm feeling good and not being able to swing at all. This should not have surprised anyone as it was less than a year since the surgery, but Donohue wanted to be back on the court so badly and he did all he could to do so.</p>\n<p>In the end, he ended up spending most of the season watching from the sidelines, feeling the pain of losing to BYU in the MPSF Semifinals and wishing he could have been on the court making a difference.</p>\n<p>“The worst part about being injured is sitting on the sideline, not being able to help out your teammates and not being able to help UCSB get the win,” Donohue said. “Now that I’m back, when I’m out there, when I get the start, I try to enjoy being on the court, competing, as much as I can.”</p>\n<p>After not being one hundred percent healthy for his junior year, Donohue made it a priority to give his shoulder time to rest so he could make the most of his last season playing the sport he loves. He went an excruciatingly long summer without picking up a volleyball, instead strengthening his legs while working with trainers consistently to monitor his shoulder.</p>\n<p>“Kevin is a great leader. He has been through so much,” redshirt sophomore outside hitter Jacob Delson said. “He leads by example and he is a great guy to look up to… He is a smart player and he teaches us younger players a lot.”</p>\n<p>Now back at full strength, Donohue has surprised himself with leading the Gauchos in kills per set at 3.75. The Gauchos are currently 14–8 this season with eyes focused on a league championship, followed by a national title.</p>\n<p>“I know we have a great team right now and if we put ourselves in the right position, anything can happen,” Donohue said. “Our goal is to win out for the rest of the season and host a playoff game … when we are playing our best game we can beat anyone.”</p>\n<p>Donohue has battled adversity throughout his volleyball career and he hopes to end it holding a trophy above his two healthy shoulders.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 15 of April 2, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61930\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/kevin-donahue-persistence-personified/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61930\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/kevin-donahue-persistence-personified/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/kevin-donahue-persistence-personified/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/kevin-donahue-persistence-personified/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/kevin-donahue-persistence-personified/","id":2038,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[2037,2036,2035],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Pedal Punk Comes to UCSB","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CirqueMechanics_Will-Tran-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CirqueMechanics_Will-Tran-2.jpg?resize=397%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Campbell Hall will be home to Cirque du Soleil-type level of awesomeness this Sunday when Pedal Punk performs two shows Sunday.

After landing a sponsor in Mongoose, Chris began to tour the world with his company Mountain Dew Freestyle Performance Team, getting attention from <em>Cirque du Soleil.</em></p>\n<p>Eventually Chris founded <em>Cirque Mechanics</em>, putting together his background as a stage technician for <em>Cirque du Solei</em><em>l</em>, a BMX rider and circus performer. With their show, <em>Cirque Mechanics </em>performers make a unique change to the circus landscape, combining BMX biking with steampunk culture.</p>\n<p>“We build these Rube Goldberg devices, that are fun to watch” Lashua said. “The German Wheel rolls around with a built on roller on the bottom, which is connected for mobility”</p>\n<p>When thinking about the details for their new show, it was only logical that these mechanical contraptions would fit nicely in the pre-industrial revolution, the theory of steampunk.</p>\n<p>Rather than seeking to make a show that combined steampunk culture with circus acts, <em>Cirque Mechanics </em>simply realized that the genre fit perfectly with the show they were constructing.  One of the facets of the show is its ability to bring in a crowd of people with various interests, whether it be the mechanical aspect, the steampunk elements or the circus act itself.</p>\n<p>“Cirque Mechanics is a mechanical circus first and foremost” Lashua said. “Executing and building things, principles of lifts and force, principles of physics, shows the range [of the show] for the audience”</p>\n<p>The work is never over for Lashua and his company of performers, who are constantly tweaking their show in order to keep their reputation as a strong performance company.</p>\n<p>“We only remain relevant if [the performers] continue to grow, and stay fresh” Lashua said. “I’ll give a note on a thing, and that’s why the show remains relevant.”</p>\n<p>The performance will take place Sunday at 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. at Campbell Hall. Tickets for UCSB students are $15 and $25 for the general public.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61731\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-07/pedal-punk-comes-to-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61731\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-07/pedal-punk-comes-to-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-07/pedal-punk-comes-to-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-07/pedal-punk-comes-to-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-07/pedal-punk-comes-to-ucsb/","id":2036,"author":{"id":287,"name":"Evander Hilton"},"related":[2035,2034,2033],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Hoop Dreams: The Motherlist of All NBA Lists","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I just want to confirm a few things in the NBA that nobody can agree on.
