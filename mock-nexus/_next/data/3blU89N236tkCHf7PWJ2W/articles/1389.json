By now, most around the area have heard about the wonderful scoring talent ball possesses especially after becoming the first Gaucho since 2005 to score double-digit goals in a single season.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73598\" style=\"width: 441px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/amanda-ball-takes-the-ball-towards-the-goal-christina-demarzo-daily-nexus/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73598\" data-attachment-id=\"73598\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-18/enthusiastic-gauchos-host-idaho-in-season-opener/amanda-ball-takes-the-ball-towards-the-goal-christina-demarzo-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ChristinaDeMarzo_WomensSoccer_10-16-16_5-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1590&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1590\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Amanda Ball takes the ball towards the goal.

Ball seems to be in great shape to continue her great run this season as she scored one of the goals in the exhibition against North Texas. Both she and junior midfielder Mallory Hromatko were named to the Big West Preseason All-Conference Team.</p>\n<p>Ball’s fellow seniors on the team, defender Kate Shoemaker, and midfielder Chace Schornstein are all poised to have a big season and, hopefully, finish their careers with a Big West championship.</p>\n<p>“Our seniors are playing very well right now, and they will be a big part of our lineup,” Stumpf said. “They’re all playing at the top of their game and I am really excited about them.”</p>\n<p>Despite all the good news out of the Santa Barbara camp right now, Idaho will not be an easy foe for UCSB to open its’ season against.</p>\n<p>The Vandals are coming off a very successful 2016-17 campaign in which they won their second consecutive Big Sky Regular Season Championship and won 10-plus games for just the fourth time in program history.</p>\n<p>Idaho was upset in the semifinal of the Big Sky Tournament losing to Eastern Washington 1-0 after allowing the game-deciding goal in the 88<sup>th</sup> minute. It was the Vandals only conference loss of the season.</p>\n<p>2017-18 will be tougher on Idaho who is replacing its top four-goal scorers from a year ago, however, mid-season transfers junior goalkeeper Makayla Presgrave and junior forward Bridget Daley hope to make the biggest impact.</p>\n<p>“They have had a lot of success over the last couple of years as a program because they really went to work on the defensive side of things with a drop and counter conceding very few goals so I expect to see something similar to that,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>These preseason games don’t mean much to the Gauchos in terms of postseason hopes. UCSB will only make the postseason, in most cases, by winning the Big West championship.</p>\n<p>Because of that, an 8-0 start to the season isn’t necessary nor should it be expected with the tough preseason Santa Barbara has lined up for themselves, however, the lessons that can be learned in these games are very important heading into conference play.</p>\n<p>“It’s super important to build off these games and build confidence but interestingly enough, I almost feel like a loss here or there will take the pressure off,” Stumpf said. “We want to win every game we can but that’s just not going to happen especially two years in a row but we hope to have a balanced record and be as prepared as we can for Big West play.”</p>\n<p>UCSB opens its season against Idaho at 7 p.m. on Friday, August 18 at Harder Stadium. The Gauchos will be on the road for the next five matches so catch them while you can.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The 10 total points are actually worse than Cal Poly’s 2016 point total, where the team had 11.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs have not been back to the playoffs since 2015 and appear to have a lot of work to do in order to get back.</p>\n<p>Despite the final score, it was actually freshman Rodney Michael who opened up the scoring for the game, giving the Gauchos the early 1-0 lead on a 15 yard shot from the top of the box.</p>\n<p>The goal was Michael’s eighth on the season, increasing his team lead in goals on the year. Michael’s scoring shot was the first UCSB since the Oct. 18 match against Sacramento State where Michael again scored all two goals of the match for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were offensively active, taking six shots in the first half, but only Michael’s was able to find the net.</p>\n<p>The play between the two teams was back and forth during the first half, much like the last meeting between the two familiar clubs.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the 43rd minute when sophomore Kenneth Higgins received a heads-up pass from teammate Jared Pressley and took a shot that went just to the left of a diving Alan Carrillo.</p>\n<p>The point was not only the Mustang’s first of the match, but it was also Higgins’ first goal of the season and the equalizer left it all even at halftime, 1-1.</p>\n<p>If the story at the end of the first half was yet another Cal Poly &amp; UCSB draw, the Mustangs were quick to change that as less than four minutes from the beginning of the second half, senior Adam Olsen found himself at the far post when the ball deflected towards him and the senior was able to tap the ball into the net for the lead, 2-1.</p>\n<p>Olsen’s mark on the match was not left at the eventual game-winning goal, as the senior lobbed a high arcing pass to a waiting Kaba Alkebulan in the 51st minute, who ran past a defender to find himself alone in the box, who headed it past Carrillo, putting Cal Poly ahead 3-1. It was Jared Pressley who scored the final goal of the match in the 65th minute as the Mustangs would go on to win 4-1.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While the Gauchos did not find themselves ready to play their last minutes of the 2017 regular season, they did find themselves looking to make the Blue-Green Rivalry their last chance to get some momentum headed into the playoffs.</p>\n<p>Throughout the month of October, UCSB has only won two games out of the eight they have played. The team has split the remaining matches between three losses and three ties.</p>\n<p>The first round of the Big West Conference Tournament will begin on Wednesday, November 1 where the number two seeded UCSB Gauchos of the North Division will host the number three seeded UC Riverside Highlanders of the South Division.</p>\n<p>In their only match of the regular season, the Gauchos hosted the Highlanders and subsequently won the match 3-1.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79369\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-drop-season-finale-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly-earn-no-2-seed-for-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79369\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-drop-season-finale-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly-earn-no-2-seed-for-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-drop-season-finale-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly-earn-no-2-seed-for-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-drop-season-finale-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly-earn-no-2-seed-for-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-drop-season-finale-to-blue-green-rival-cal-poly-earn-no-2-seed-for-big-west-tournament/","id":1388,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1387,1386,1385],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"LBSU Ends Gauchos’ Three-Game Win Streak","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo12-web.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"UCSB gets shutout for the first time in 11 games as it falls to the 49ers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_65226\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo12-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"423318898\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65245\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65226\" data-attachment-id=\"65226\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/lbsu-ends-gauchos-three-game-win-streak/angelisa-cortez-charges-toward-the-goal-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WSoccer9-6-15ChristinaDeMarzo12-web.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Angelisa Cortez charges toward the goal.

The trio combined for three of UCSB’s five shots in the half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ best opportunity in the first period was a corner kick in the 10th minute as Schornstein sent a header towards the back of the net only to be snagged by Long Beach goalkeeper Ashton McKeown.</p>\n<p>McKeown has been a force behind goal for the 49ers, leading the Big West with a save percentage of .877. The junior from Huntington Beach, CA has recorded ten saves in her three previous Big West appearances, adding five more in Sunday’s contest.</p>\n<p>“It was a combination of [missed scores] and [a] very good goal keeper [at] play in today’s match,” Stumpf said. “We had one good look at it [in the first half] but [McKeown] made one great save.”</p>\n<p>Despite an aggressive 45 minutes of controlling possession 59 to 41, Santa Barbara went into halftime locked in a 0-0 gridlock.</p>\n<p>“We took the ball away from them and created more chances than [Long Beach] did, but just didn’t stick one away,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos kept an aggressive tone starting the second period as two yellow cards were issued in the first 10 minutes to junior defender Sydney Fuertes and junior midfielder Sara Feder.</p>\n<p>In the 52nd minute Feder responded on the offensive end, cutting past the 49er defensive line and sending a kick from 15 yards out, but it ricocheted out of bounds.</p>\n<p>Still locked at zero, the Gauchos had another chance in the 67th minute from sophomore defender Kate Shoemaker. Schornstein found Shoemaker off a free kick and Shoemaker headed the ball just to the left of the net. A diving save, however, from the 49ers’ McKeown kept her team alive and the match at a stalemate.</p>\n<p>The game ultimately came down to the 76th minute as Long Beach State’s Vania Robles moved her way into the box and popped the ball over the UCSB backline for sophomore forward Ashley Gonzalez.</p>\n<p>Although Gonzalez was met at goal by junior goalkeeper Jacq Caginia, a quick in-and-out move from the reigning Big West Freshman of the Year sent the ball down the line to the left corner of the net. This gave the 49ers a late 1-0 edge with 15 minutes remaining in regulation.</p>\n<p>“We made one mistake in the back and paid a massive price for it,” Stumpf said. “Against a good team like Long Beach you have to play mistake free and unfortunately we just didn’t do it.”</p>\n<p>Gonzalez has racked in six total goals on the year. The Ontario, CA native has been the X-factor since the start of the Big West for Long Beach, burying a game-winning overtime goal on Oct. 4 against defending Big West champions Cal State Fullerton. Gonzalez’s exceptional conference play also earned her the Big West Player of the Week award.</p>\n<p>As the Gauchos move to an even .500 in conference, junior Sydney Fuertes believes there are positives to take out of this tough match and this young team.</p>\n<p>“We definitely executed our game plan [today] all but finishing,” Fuertes said. “We dominated possession in the first and second half, but it was just a matter of someone making a play … our team worked till the end and now we know to put games away early.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos renew their blue-green rivalry against Cal Poly this Thursday.  The match will take place at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

So, in the end, it just comes down to personnel and the function of forwards [not making plays quick enough and passing] and playing as forwards,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>UCSB is now 6-6-5 and 4-2-3 in the Big West, while Sac. St. sits at 8-7-2, 4-3-2. Santa Barbara came into the match second in the division with 14 points, while Sac St. was third with 13.</p>\n<p>Following Wednesday’s match, no changes took place in the North Division standings as the Gaucho-Hornet stalemate led to one point for both teams, leaving UCSB in second (15 points) and Sac St. in third (14 points), however, UC Davis was crowned the Big West North Division champion after its 2-1 victory over Cal Poly on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The game whistle sounded and both teams were off to a booming start. The Sac State Hornets were the first to strike as Gaucho freshman keeper saved an open shot on goal. This would be the first of only two on target shots the Hornets had all night.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos then peppered in a couple shot of their own, but besides foul trouble from both ends, the rest of the first half remained pretty stagnant regardless of all the team substitutions. Both teams would end up with a combined total of 33 infractions on the night.</p>\n<p>A standout moment in regulation, was when a Red Card was given to the Gaucho bench in the 68<sup>th</sup> minute, in response to their passionate reaction to what the team felt was a no call.</p>\n<p>As for the second half of play, UCSB went ahead and took reign of possession. This eventually proved to be a recurring theme for the home side as it seemed every following counterattack was called offside as well leading to the Gauchos seventh overtime match of the season, the fourth that went into OT tied 0-0.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were instantly aggressive in the opening minutes of the first OT period, attempting three corner kicks in a row, but to no avail. There was only one shot attempted in the second OT period for either team, and that shot was by senior Kim.</p>\n<p>The lack of playmaking ability from the midfield was prevalent as all key passes from half field just seemed to be swallowed up by the Hornet defensive line. In the end, the end of the game had arrived and both teams settled for the draw.</p>\n<p>“Our forwards are young; they work hard and have loads of talent. But passing is sometimes an afterthought for them. So when they finally get into that situation, it’s too late, which is why we need a guy that can get up the field and make those passes,” Vom Steeg said. “Subsequently, it’s forward passing to forward so these passes end up being too short, too far or behind. Which is when the goalie comes running up at you and you won’t have enough time to run around him or chip the ball over.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this was the case for both teams. Regardless of all the counterattacks and offside calls, neither side was able to pull the trigger and earn the winning goal. Whether it was nerves or just quality defense on both ends, it was a great showing no doubt.</p>\n<p>Senior night was also upon us and some of the Gauchos were about to play their final regular season home game of the season. Players being honored recognized for their contribution to the team included: seniors Seo-In Kim, Omar Montalvo, Josue Salgado, Alex Liua, and Randy Mendoza. Each of these players started or were subbed throughout the match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now head away for their last game of the season as they face Cal Poly in the last installment of this year’s Blue Green men’s soccer rivalry beginning at 7 p.m. on Saturday, October 28 at Alex G. Spanos Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79344\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79344\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/","id":1386,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1385,1384,1383],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
