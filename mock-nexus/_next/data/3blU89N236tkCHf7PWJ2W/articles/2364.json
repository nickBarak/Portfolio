On average, the fire department typically responds to 10 to 15 fire alarms per month.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Eliason said the fire department responded to 51 calls on campus and in Isla Vista in the same time period, 39 of which were emergencies and 12 of which were alarms.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He said the increase in alarms could be attributed to the increase in people using campus facilities, although there is no “long-term discernible pattern” as to why alarms go off as often as they do. According to Eliason, most calls happen on Friday and Saturday night in I.V.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Eliason said fire alarms are often triggered in various ways. One fire crew member claimed a spider had even triggered one alarm.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“There have been times where literally a spider crawls up inside and sets off a sensor,” Eliason said in an email.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The fire department responded to two calls provoked by the smell of dust from a construction site on campus Tuesday. During the school year, alarms are often set off by burnt popcorn or rice in communal kitchens.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“There are more people using hot plates [and] making microwave popcorn than in the summer,” Eliason said in an email. “Take for instance yesterday’s call with the dust. In the summer, someone might not have been there (as it turned out) to pull the alarm.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The only damage in these situations is “slight embarrassment” for the person who pulled the alarm, Eliason said, but it is best to be cautious.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“We do not mind responding to these calls, that is why we are here, to serve the public. We send a lot of resources to calls, because we can always turn them back if they aren’t needed,” he said in an email.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He said pulling false fire alarms “very rarely occurs” at UCSB. Pulling a false fire alarm in California is a felony and can include a punishment of imprisonment, a fine of no less than $500, no more than $10,000 or both, according to state law.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Annual Fire Prevention Week is Oct. 8 to 14 and the county fire department’s focus this year is preparation, according to Eliason.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Every second counts in a fire, he said, and can “mean the difference between residents of our community escaping safely from a fire or having their lives end in tragedy.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">To prevent fires, the county fire department recommends drawing a map of one’s home and marking two exits for each room, as well as a path outside.</p>\n<p>In the event of a fire, the fire department also recommends closing doors while evacuating a building since it can possibly slow down the spread of smoke, heat and fire. Numbers on your home’s apartment should be clearly marked so firefighters may easily locate a fire when it occurs.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page three of the October 5, 2017,

August 2016 after the university opened a Title IX investigation against him. The university opened the investigation after it discovered a 19-second video in which Doe and his ex-girlfriend argued on camera before the screen went black.</p>\n<p>University officials said the video “amply justified” Doe’s suspension while the university conducted a Title IX investigation.</p>\n<p>Doe filed a complaint against the university in December 2016 to remove the interim suspension and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">returned to school in April</a> 2017.</p>\n<p>Judge Thomas Anderle of the Santa Barbara Superior Court ruled against the imposed suspension in the March court order, citing the university’s concealment of evidence as a cause and calling the university “seriously prejudiced” in its actions.</p>\n<p>“This court disagrees with UCSB’s claim that the University’s use of the detective’s summaries in issuing the interim suspension does not violate his due process rights,” Anderle said in the court ruling. “John Doe is entitled to know all the information against him at the hearing, not via emailing his counsel allegedly critical and decisive information at a later time.”</p>\n<p>Bob Ottilie, Doe’s lawyer, submitted an amended complaint to Anderle in July alleging that the university concealed evidence from Doe and violated his right to due process.</p>\n<p>According to the court order and complaint, former director of judicial affairs Sandra Vasquez withheld two police emails from Doe during a hearing with him on Sept., 22, 2016 that the university used in the investigation. One email included statements by third parties attributed to Doe’s ex-girlfriend, Jane Doe.</p>\n<p>Anderle found that the university never contacted Jane Doe to corroborate the statements.</p>\n<p>After the hearing, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn made the decision to continue Doe’s suspension until the conclusion of the Title IX investigation.</p>\n<p>The court received the evidence in March days before a court hearing on March 21. At the hearing, Klawunn said under oath she had considered the two pieces of concealed evidence in making her decision.</p>\n<p>The university declined to comment on the case.</p>\n<p>Vasquez has since left her position at UCSB and is now the dean of students at Pitzer College. Vasquez could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>In an email to the Pitzer student body in August in response to allegations of concealing evidence from Doe, however, Vasquez said she has “never concealed material evidence in any case.”</p>\n<p>Anderle also said in the court ruling that the university took too long to investigate, the<em> Nexus</em> reported in April, failing to conclude the Title IX investigation within the 60 calendar day deadline federally required for Title IX investigations and the 60 business day deadline required by the university.</p>\n<p>The Title IX investigation is still ongoing, and the university has not placed charges on the student or interviewed any key witnesses.<br>\nThe judge also ruled that the university caused Doe “irreparable harm” in barring him from the majority of his first year at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Ottilie said he is “confident” Doe’s record will ultimately be cleared due to the evidence in support of the student and Judge Anderle’s ruling in March.</p>\n<p>“If charged and convicted, we are just going to go back to court with the same record and the same judge and ask the judge to throw it out — which we’re confident he would,” Ottilie said.</p>\n<p>In a letter from Ottilie to the UC Regents and the Office of the Chancellor at UCSB, Ottilie expressed concern that the university mistreated Doe through the suspension because he is a minority student and unable to legally contest due to lack of financial resources.</p>\n<p>According to the March court ruling, Doe has incurred more than $100,000 in attorney’s fees since his filing in December. Ottilie said in an interview with the <em>Nexus</em> on Monday that Doe is currently unable to pay the expenses.</p>\n<p>The United States Department of Education accepted the case for further investigation of potential Title IX and VI policy violations.</p>\n<p>According to the Department of Education’s website, Title IX “prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex” and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the September 21, 2017, print edition

teaching professor at UCSB.</p>\n<p>With vast knowledge of chemistry and university history as well as a witty sense of humor, Kirtman is the kind of professor who prompts the image of a long conversation over a cup of tea.</p>\n<p>He instantly make guests feel welcome in his paper-cluttered office on the fourth floor of the chemistry building.</p>\n<p>Kirtman is a professor in the chemistry department and specializes in the quantum theory of electronic structure, which requires predicting the properties of all chemical systems based on the electronic motions in their atomic systems.</p>\n<p>Born on March 30, 1935, and originally from New York, Kirtman went to Columbia University for undergraduate studies and received a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from Harvard University in 1961.</p>\n<p>The year 1965 was an exciting time for UCSB because the campus was expanding geographically and academically, Kirtman said.</p>\n<p>“The campus had decided to grow and I think that’s part of why I came here,” Kirtman said. “It was going to grow into a major research university.”</p>\n<p>“I get lost walking on the campus myself,” he joked, adding that the many construction projects over the years have transformed the university. The chemistry building where his office is located was not yet constructed when Kirtman began teaching in 1965.</p>\n<p>As Kirtman reflected on his most memorable moments at UCSB, he recalled the Vietnam War as a critical turning point in politics on campus and in the university’s academic curriculum.</p>\n<p>Kirtman said during the war he was responsible for managing a crisis courses program, in which professors could alter their class syllabi to include information about the operation in Vietnam.</p>\n<p>“Professors could either participate in that program and change the orientation of their course for a quarter to meet what was going on in Vietnam, or continue the way they were going,” Kirtman explained.</p>\n<p>While Kirtman did not reorganize his own classes on quantum theory to address the Vietnam War, he created a course for all students on the social responsibility of scientists in response to the war.</p>\n<p>“At the very beginning of the course, I had to reorient the class to develop the scientific way of thinking about things,” he said, noting that scientists and humanists differ in the way they reach conclusions and answers to problems.</p>\n<p>In bridging scientific thinking and social issues, Kirtman connected the way science was becoming increasingly political and addressed how scientists should be vocal in scientific political dialogue.</p>\n<p>Kirtman said his own son researches climate science at the University of Miami in Florida and said he hopes his son becomes involved in the political debate surrounding climate change.</p>\n<p>“I often say, ‘The lawyers think they can abolish the law of thermodynamics, which is a scientific law you can’t abolish,’ ” he said with a chuckle. “Science is made political by politicians and it is a very important issue right now.”</p>\n<p>Kirtman said he is most proud of his work with students who have gone on to careers in chemistry as well as his own research conducted in quantum theory.</p>\n<p>“There’s been a lot of individual research moments when the light bulb went on,” he said.</p>\n<p>He is especially proud of the “revolutionary” work he did with quantum theory as applied to electric fields interacting with crystalline materials. This work was featured in a symposium in Rhodes, Greece, in 2009.</p>\n<p>While Kirtman said he certainly has favorite students, he said he believes any student can be successful if they are willing to work diligently.</p>\n<p>He also served as the chair of the chemistry department from 1985 to 1994 and is the former chair of the Academic Senate. He was also one of the first professors to teach students in the College of Creative Studies when it formed in 1967.</p>\n<p>A love of UCSB runs in the family, as Kirtman’s wife also worked for the university as the director of publications for the <em>Nexus</em>. The couple will celebrate their 60th wedding anniversary in December.</p>\n<p>While his two children live on the East Coast, Kirtman said he loves the UC and California and does not have plans to leave anytime soon.</p>\n<p>“You don’t leave unless there’s good reason to leave,” he said. “Santa Barbara is a great place to live and work with very good faculty and students. So, why leave?”</p>\n<p>Kirtman dedicated his life to academics and said working and being a part of a university has been extremely rewarding. As the school year begins, Kirtman advises all students to take advantage of UCSB’s unique classes and academic opportunities.</p>\n<p>“Have fun. It’s a great time of life and you have no responsibilities,” Kirtman said enthusiastically, with perhaps a touch of nostalgia in his eyes. “Take everything that’s offered and pursue all your interests.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the September 28, 2017, edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78876\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/oldest-ucsb-prof-taught-through-vietnam-civil-rights-movement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78876\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/oldest-ucsb-prof-taught-through-vietnam-civil-rights-movement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/oldest-ucsb-prof-taught-through-vietnam-civil-rights-movement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/oldest-ucsb-prof-taught-through-vietnam-civil-rights-movement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/oldest-ucsb-prof-taught-through-vietnam-civil-rights-movement/","id":2361,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2360,2359,2358],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"G.O.L.D.

The university released the current version of G.O.L.D. in the beginning of 2006, and the website has not undergone changes since its launch.</p>\n<p>The new updates will make the website more compatible with mobile phones and alter the color scheme and design to align with other websites, such as the official university <a href=\"https://www.ucsb.edu/\">website</a>, which is clearer and more modern than the current G.O.L.D. site.</p>\n<p>“We made attempts to make it look and feel like a UCSB site. Right now, it’s kind of its own thing,” said Anthony Schmid, the Associate Registrar for Information Systems.</p>\n<p>Schmid said the Registrar has been working on the updates for approximately one year. The mobile version of the website will be completed by the end of the calendar year, as the Registrar has decided on the appearance of the website and is waiting for developers to edit and test the site.</p>\n<p>Schmid said the changes will make G.O.L.D. “more manageable” for students to access the website on their phone. He said approximately 44 percent of the 4,864,849 times G.O.L.D. has been accessed in the past year has been through mobile phones.</p>\n<p>“Whenever I try to access G.O.L.D. on my phone to check things, it’s a bit of a pain to navigate and have to pinch and zoom to see anything,” Schmid said.</p>\n<p>The Registrar is also making adjustments to the “Graduation” page on G.O.L.D. to be more straightforward and is redesigning the “Advanced Course Search” function, Schmid said. There is not a set date for the completion of these projects.</p>\n<p>University Registrar Leesa Beck also said the Registrar is interested in making it easier to find and use degree audits to help more students understand their academic progress and graduate on time</p>\n<p>Schmid said, however, that the university is focused on updating the “look and feel” of the website before altering its functionality.</p>\n<p>Student Information Systems and Technology provides support for the Registrar’s websites and estimates the total project will cost between $15,000 and $20,000, depending on the amount of additional work needed based on the site testing.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, students have created their own extensions to the G.O.L.D. website unaffiliated with the university. An application called GauchoMap launched on Oct. 2016 on Google Chrome that allows students to locate their classes on G.O.L.D. in an interactive map.</p>\n<p>Students have shared information about the application on Facebook groups such as Free &amp; For Sale, a page on which students can buy and sell items like clothes and furniture. According to the Google Chrome web store, the application currently has 274 users.</p>\n<p>Schmid said students also added a Rate My Professor extension to the website, which lasted for approximately two years. He said the university is not concerned with the student-created extensions unless the extensions use the UCSB name and seal.</p>\n<p>Schmid said while the Registrar has not received any vocal complaints about the G.O.L.D. website, the Registrar wanted to upgrade the appearance of the site to keep it up-to-date with modern standards.</p>\n<p>“We figured it was time to move into the 20-teens [of technology],” Schmid said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the September 28, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78880\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/g-o-l-d-prepares-mobile-updates/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78880\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/g-o-l-d-prepares-mobile-updates/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/g-o-l-d-prepares-mobile-updates/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/g-o-l-d-prepares-mobile-updates/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/g-o-l-d-prepares-mobile-updates/","id":2363,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2362,2361,2360],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
