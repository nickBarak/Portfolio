With their loss to USC, the Lions are polar opposite to the Gauchos, sitting at 7-1.</p>\n<p>Despite their 1-7 start, the Gauchos have found success when they run their offense as envisioned by Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson.</p>\n<p>Henrickson has aimed to orchestrate her team’s offense so that the ball moves through their star in the post, senior forward Drew Edelman. Edelman, while battling a few instances of injuries this year, is averaging team-highs in both points (14.4) and rebounds (8.3) per game.</p>\n<p>However, it seems Edelman is hoping to work her way back to the form she displayed last season when she led the Big West in field-goal percentage (61.4).</p>\n<p>Recently emerging to help Edelman in the scoring department has been redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter. Porter is averaging 10 points, 4.1 rebounds and two assists per game on the season.</p>\n<p>She has been living and dying by the three-ball this season, making 10 shots from beyond the arc in the team’s last three contests.</p>\n<p>However, she started the season only making threes in the first six games.</p>\n<p>Overall, Porter is shooting 30 percent from downtown and will hopefully start finding the net on a more consistent basis.</p>\n<p>In fact in her last three games, she has already shown to be more consistent, knocking down 10 of 25 deep balls.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos have also shown glimpses of hot shooting, they should perhaps avoid getting into a high-scoring contest with LMU.</p>\n<p>UCSB this season is averaging 62.8 ppg, about 14 points less a game than the Lions who average nearly 76 points per contest.</p>\n<p>Contributing to its strong offensive presence were valuable performances made by a few talented players.</p>\n<p>Standing out for the Lions is junior Cheyanne Wallace, who is averaging a team-high 19.5 points along with grabbing 7.8 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Wallace was named the West Coast Conference Player of the Week on Nov. 27.</p>\n<p>Standing at 6’0” in a guard/forward position, Wallace posted 26 ppg and a little over eight boards per game during the week in which she earned the WCC honor.<br>\nShe will certainly be on the Santa Barbara coaching staff’s radar this week, as it will attempt to slow down one of LMU’s best offensive weapons.</p>\n<p>The difficulty for the Gauchos is that LMU has accompanying scoring options to supplement Wallace.</p>\n<p>The Lions have also been getting strong contributions from guard Gabby Green. The 6’2” redshirt junior is in the midst of her debut season at LMU, as she transferred from Berkeley after playing for the Golden Bears for two years.</p>\n<p>In her first year as a Lion, Green has been putting up well-rounded stat lines.</p>\n<p>Green is averaging 15.9 points to go with 6.4 boards and nearly four assists per game.</p>\n<p>Also, Green has so far blocked 10 shots and recorded 21 steals.</p>\n<p>The closest other Lion to these kinds of numbers is none other than Wallace, who has six blocks and 11 steals on the year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will surely have their hands full Thursday night trying to contain LMU’s stars, but UCSB knows it has players who can find the net too such as Edelman and Porter.</p>\n<p>In last year’s meeting between Santa Barbara and the Lions, LMU took the close victory over the Gauchos by just two points, 57-55.</p>\n<p>The year before that loss, the Gauchos also came up short against LMU, so it is likely they will look to redeem themselves.</p>\n<p>Thursday night’s action will tip off at 7 p.m. against Loyola Marymount at the Thunderdome where the Gauchos will look to end their seven-game losing streak and earn their first home win.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Dec. 7, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Beavers are ranked 17th in the nation and will look to continue their strong regular season before starting competitive Pac-12 conference play.</p>\n<p>Saturday night’s game was held at the Moda Center in Portland, the home to the NBA’s Portland Trailblazers, for the Dam City Classic in which both the Men’s and Women’s OSU basketball teams compete.</p>\n<p>The game between UCSB and OSU started with a three-pointer made by freshman guard Danae Miller, giving Santa Barbara the early 3-0 lead. The Beavers responded with a trio of unanswered layups to take the 6-3 lead with 7:18 remaining in the first quarter of play.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the Gauchos, their early 3-0 lead would be their sole lead of the night. The low-scoring quarter was rounded out by a pair of buckets by Miller and senior forward Drew Edelman, while the Beavers used a well-rounded scoring effort to lead 14-7 heading into the second quarter.</p>\n<p>UCSB struggled shooting the ball to start the game, notching a sub-par shooting percentage of 15 percent from the floor and an even worse 12 percent from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>In the second quarter, Santa Barbara managed to score 11 points, all from Edelman and redshirt sophomore Tal Sahar.</p>\n<p>Edelman finished the game with 10 points and 4 rebounds, while Sahar led the Gauchos with a season-high 11 points and 7 boards despite shooting 5-17 from the field and going 1-9 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>Edelman and Sahar were the lone Gauchos to score in double figures. Oregon State heated up in the second, exploding for 27 points to build a 41-18 lead at the half. Another diversified scoring effort for OSU saw seven Beavers score, led by an 8-point quarter for Kat Tudor.</p>\n<p>Tudor was one of four Beavers to score in double figures on the night, posting 14 points for her team. Center Marie Gulich added 6 in the quarter as part of her 10-point night to go along with 6 boards.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara regrouped during halftime and was able to put together a 19-point third quarter effort. Sarah Porter, a redshirt junior, scored all of her 6 points in the third.</p>\n<p>Two made jumpers by Sahar and then a Sarah Porter three-ball got things rolling for the Gauchos and cut the Beaver lead to 18; however, OSU maintained its composure to keep Santa Barbara at bay.</p>\n<p>OSU guard Aleah Goodman scored 8 of her game-high 17 points in the quarter and the Beavers shot 60 percent from three to subdue Santa Barbara’s brief attempts at making runs. The quarter ended with the Beavers up 62-37 and hopes of a UCSB comeback minimal.</p>\n<p>The fourth quarter saw both teams score 12 points, despite much of those baskets falling during garbage time. With the sound of the final buzzer, OSU held on to beat Santa Barbara 74-49.</p>\n<p>On the night, UCSB held its own in the paint, tying the Beavers for 26 points in the paint and only being outrebounded 34-33.</p>\n<p>An issue for the Gauchos was perhaps their poor shooting effort, going only 22-66 from the field, but also the fact that they failed to reach the free throw line.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara committed 19 personal fouls, OSU was only called for 3 fouls. The Beavers shot 52.9 percent overall and 56.3 percent from three-point territory in an efficient night finding the net.</p>\n<p>Despite the loss to the Beavers, the Gauchos will turn around to face Loyola Marymount at LMU on Monday.</p>\n<p>The game, which was rescheduled from its original date of December 7th due to conditions created by the Thomas Fire, will tip off at 7:00pm.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will look to get their second win of the season against a talented LMU team and use their experiences against top-25 teams in moving forward.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80296\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-17/gauchos-struggles-continue-following-blowout-loss-at-no-17-oregon-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80296\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-17/gauchos-struggles-continue-following-blowout-loss-at-no-17-oregon-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-17/gauchos-struggles-continue-following-blowout-loss-at-no-17-oregon-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-17/gauchos-struggles-continue-following-blowout-loss-at-no-17-oregon-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-17/gauchos-struggles-continue-following-blowout-loss-at-no-17-oregon-state/","id":202,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[201,200,199],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
