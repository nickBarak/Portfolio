Here are the top four teams in baseball at the start of the season.</p>\n<p><strong>St. Louis Cardinals</strong><br>\nAlthough the Cardinals fell in the World Series last season, they are back and hungry for another title with their always-consistent model of winning.<br>\nSt. Louis’ biggest strength is its starting rotation, beginning with veteran ace Adam Wainwright and followed by promising youngsters in Shelby Miller, Lance Lynn and Michael Wacha.<br>\nAs for the position players, the Cardinals possess arguably the best defensive catcher in the league with Yadier Molina.<br>\nDespite losing Carlos Beltran in free agency, St. Louis brings back a trio of Matts in Matt Holliday, Matt Adams and Matt Carpenter to provide a reliable and consistent batting order.<br>\nThe Cardinals are an organization that consistently wins due to managerial and front office stability and this season should be another successful one for the organization.</p>\n<p><strong>Detroit Tigers</strong><br>\nDetroit possesses the best hitter in baseball with two-time defending AL MVP Miguel Cabrera.<br>\nThe Tigers made some headlines this season, trading Prince Fielder for second baseman Ian Kinsler, who combined with Cabrera, Torii Hunter and Victor Martinez, forms a dangerous top of the lineup.<br>\nThe starting rotation is deadly with two Cy Young winners in Justin Verlander and Max Scherzer, while Rick Porcello and Anibal Sanchez are solid mid of the rotation guys.<br>\nThe bullpen is still an area of concern for the Tigers, but the team addressed that in the off-season and might be the top team in the American League.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

\r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Los Angeles Dodgers</strong><br>\nThe Dodgers have the potential to be the most dangerous team in baseball.<br>\nLos Angeles has the best pitcher in baseball in Clayton Kershaw to go along with Zack Greinke and Hyun-jin Ryu as all three had sub-3 ERAs last season. The bullpen is stacked with Kenley Jansen at closer and three former closers in Brian Wilson, J.P. Howell and Chris Perez.<br>\nThe big area of concern is injuries. Hanley Ramirez was the hottest player in baseball for a month last season and Yasiel Puig wasn’t far behind. Both have had issues with nagging injuries in the past. If both can stay healthy and Matt Kemp can come back to his All-Star form, the Dodgers could take home their first World Series trophy since 1988.</p>\n<p><strong>Boston Red Sox</strong><br>\nThe defending World Series champions were expected to be in rebuilding mode last season after a disastrous 2012, but instead gelled and became the best team in baseball.<br>\nBoston brings back the ageless David Ortiz along with Dustin Pedroia.<br>\nThe loss of Jacoby Ellsbury to the Yankees certainly hurts, but the Red Sox have a number of promising young position players in Xander Bogaerts and Will Middlebrooks to pick up the offensive production.<br>\nPitching is still an area of concern for the Red Sox but if John Lackey can continue to be consistent along with Jon Lester, Jake Peavy and Clay Buchholz, Boston has the arsenal of arms to win again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>a version of this article appeared on page 13 of April 2nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The majority of the board is composed of UC Santa Barbara students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision follows last week’s Associated Students (A.S.) Senate meeting, during which the Senate <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/a-s-senate-supports-bike-committee-demands-for-more-srb-bike-parking/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1557379437132000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG9AJPJIoJZs9eAq9LRFIcKIn-1GQ\">unanimously passed a resolution</a> in support of adding new bicycle parking back into the design’s plans after it was cut at the end of 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SRB North Landscaping Design Project redesigns unused lawn space surrounding the SRB, according to Dominic Velasco, a fourth-year music studies major and Campus Learning Assistance Services (CLAS) representative to the SRB Governance Board. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The project wants to see those spaces transformed into something that students can use for whatever purposes, be it community events or studying, to basically repurpose them so that they become more … heavily utilized,” Velasco said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The governance board first conceptualized the North Landscaping Design Project in Winter Quarter 2018. After discovering that the initial plan for the project did not include any new bike parking, the A.S. Bike Committee began advocating for the addition of bike parking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annie Golay, chair of the A.S. bike committee, wrote a letter to the SRB Governance Board in Spring Quarter 2018, offering a compromise design that included 35 new bike spaces directly in front of the SRB. The governance board then agreed to the 35 new bike spaces in an updated design. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While we would have liked to have gotten more, we felt like the 35 was a good compromise between having bike parking for students and having [bike parking] available in the safest way possible, in addition to meeting their needs for programming as well,” Golay said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The original design plan included renovations of five major areas, which includes the lawn directly in front of the SRB, empty space in front of Parking Lot 22 and the bike path which runs between these two areas. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the SRB Governance Board was notified by the Campus Planning Committee within the UCSB Office of Budget and Planning at the end of 2018 that the scope of their design was not possible, according to Velasco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We found out that the school has future plans for pretty much 80% of the area we wanted to renovate, so now we’re only renovating a very small portion of land that’s right in front of the SRB,” Velasco said. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88071\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88071\" data-attachment-id=\"88071\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-09/bike-committee-opposition-does-not-change-srb-design-plans/ucsb-srb-north-gathering-space_conceptplan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?fit=250%2C162&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?fit=888%2C575&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-88071 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?resize=888%2C575\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"575\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?resize=250%2C162&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?resize=768%2C497&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C663&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&amp;ssl=1 355w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88071\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The SRB North Landscaping Design Project design from May 2018. Only Area 4 is part of the current design.<em> Courtesy of Annie Golay and Ricardo Uribe</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the project was minimized, new bike parking was removed altogether. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We knew we needed to act fast because we felt that bike parking is a huge problem on campus and our job as a committee is to make sure we have appropriate infrastructure and bike parking available for students, because bike parking is such a vital part of our campus,” Golay said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A.S. Bike Committee wrote a second letter to the SRB Governance Board on March 1, spoke to board members at multiple meetings and helped draft the A.S. Senate resolution that passed last week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ricardo Uribe serves as both a Letters and Science Senator as well as a board representative for the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity. He believes that the student support from the resolution did not change the outcome of current design plans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Obviously that resolution shows that there was some sort of need for this space … I think that the resolution didn’t have an effect that it attended to,” Uribe said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At last Friday’s SRB Governance Board meeting, three different propositions for the design project were presented: either add bike parking, wait until other future projects planned by the university for the area were completed or move forward with the SRB Design plan without bike parking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board voted 11-2 to move forward without bike parking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two board members who voted in favor of bike parking are both affiliated with A.S.: Alexis Xa, the A.S. representative on the SRB Governance Board, and Uribe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Golay, who spoke at Friday’s governance board meeting, believes the current amount of bicycle parking is insufficient and causes a safety threat to students going to the SRB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because students have to pass all these bike lanes to get to the SRB, it is really dangerous, and that lot is already over-subscribed,” Golay said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We think the safest and best option is to include at least a few bike parking spaces at the SRB, because currently none exist, and we’re concerned about the safety and needs of students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main priority of the SRB Governance Board, according to Velasco, was to begin work as soon as possible on the SRB North Landscape Design Project. If bike parking was added, a new redesign would be required, pushing the project back by another year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On June 7, the SRB Governance Board will vote to approve the final cost of $560,000 for the project. If this measure passes, construction will begin in summer 2019.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
