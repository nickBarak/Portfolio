UCSB dominated #6 Harvard in the 2-0 victory, leading the Crimson in shots, 10-8.</p>\n<p>“Our team chemistry is getting better every practice and it definitely came together for us last weekend beating a very good Harvard team,” junior midfielder Danny Barrera said.</p>\n<p>A day later, the Gauchos shut out Buffalo 4-0. As they have done in every game this season, UCSB once again outshot its opponent, 14-6.</p>\n<p>“We did get off to a slow start this season and had some tough breaks, but it’s nice to be playing well heading into the UCLA game,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>For his efforts in goal, senior goalkeeper Sam Hayden was named the Lobo Classic Defensive MVP. Hayden — who posted two consecutive shutouts with five saves in each match — was also named to the College Soccer News National Team of the Week and picked as the Big West Defensive Player of the Week.</p>\n<p>Barrera was named Offensive MVP and freshman forward David Opoku, sophomore midfielder Machael David and sophomore forward Sam Garza all earned All-Tournament Honors.</p>\n<p>Opoku was also named the Big West Offensive Player of the Week after leading UCSB with five points over the two tournament games. The freshman scored the first goal of his career in the 87th minute against Harvard, and then followed up that performance with his second career goal against Buffalo.</p>\n<p>“We needed the confidence boost from these last two wins,” Opoku said. “We are ready and really pumped heading forward.”</p>\n<p>The matchup is not an easy one. Although they have lost eight seniors from last year’s squad, UCLA is still a very formidable team, and are already 3-0 in overtime games this year. Thus far, the Bruins have been led by a pair of freshmen. Midfielder Kelyn Rowe leads the team with three goals to go along with two assists, and forward Victor Chavez leads the team with three assists to go along with two goals.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need to take advantage of their experience and veteran leadership to maintain a consistent effort throughout the match if they are to take down the Bruins.</p>\n<p>“We need to stick to our game plan and play consistent throughout the entire 90 minutes, especially defensively,”  Vom Steeg said. “Especially with the student crowd behind us, I am really confident we are going to show up and play well.”</p>\n<p>The match is set for 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-25981\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-23/ucsb-hosts-bruins-harder/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-25981\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-23/ucsb-hosts-bruins-harder/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-23/ucsb-hosts-bruins-harder/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-23/ucsb-hosts-bruins-harder/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-23/ucsb-hosts-bruins-harder/","id":1759,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[1758,1757,1756],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush","biography":"Not available","articles":[721,733,736,737,740,754,756,757,759,761,764,774,780,783,784,787,788,791,792,793,796,799,800,806,810,811,813,821,822,824,834,839,841,907,1235,1736,1743,1745,1759,2282,2291,2301,2303,2789,2809,2826,2893,2895,2896,3496,5511,5515,5518,5522,5526,5527,5528,5532,5535,5537,5538,5539,5541,5545,5546,5553,5554],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Look to Leash Bulldogs","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Gaucho women’s soccer will look to end their nonconference season on a high note as they head to Fresno State on Friday to take on the Bulldogs.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Gaucho women’s soccer will look to end their nonconference season on a high note as they head to Fresno State on Friday to take on the Bulldogs.

She leads the team with 24 shots, half of them on goal. She also tacks on two goals and two assists to that, making her the team’s most productive player. This week, Head Coach Paul Stumpf will have to look elsewhere for those numbers.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It is a very big gap,” Stumpf said. “We tried a couple things in practice where we put different people in that target spot she normally plays.

After starting the season on a 3-0 tear, the team evened out, putting together a 1-4-1 record since then, including a 1-0 loss to Oklahoma on Sunday, the team’s first home loss of the season.</p>\n<p>“We’re a really good soccer team. We play really quality soccer. Each of those games that we’ve lost we’ve had opportunities,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “We are measured by our results, and so I’m a little bit disappointed with some of the results, but the development has been continuous.”</p>\n<p>That Oklahoma game saw UCSB in a defensive struggle, something that McDonald does not want to see again.</p>\n<p>“I was pretty dead after the game trying to make up for all the running I had to do on defense,” McDonald said. “It’s important to stay defensive-minded, but what’s more important is playing our game and not letting the other team affect what we’re there to do.”</p>\n<p>And what the Gauchos are there to do is score, regardless of personnel.</p>\n<p>“We’re creating a number of opportunities but not maximizing those opportunities,” Stumpf said. “It would be great for us to stick some goals in. We know we can defend, but we’ve not done a great job of scoring so we are looking to get some balance there.”</p>\n<p>The overriding goal all season will be the conference tournament in November, something Stumpf always has in the back of his mind.</p>\n<p>“Our focus now is to keep getting better every day, so when that conference tournament rolls around in early November we’re rolling on all cylinders,” Stumpf said. “And the team is on board in that. I still really like our chances going forward.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff against Fresno State will be at 7 p.m. on Friday before the conference season starts a week later when the Gauchos hit the road to take on UC Riverside.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-25975\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-23/gauchos-leash-bulldogs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-25975\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-23/gauchos-leash-bulldogs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-23/gauchos-leash-bulldogs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-23/gauchos-leash-bulldogs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-23/gauchos-leash-bulldogs/","id":1756,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[1755,1754,1753],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Set for League Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men’s soccer team will begin Big West play today when it travels to UC Riverside for its league opener.

Both games were shutout victories, and provide some perspective on today’s league opener.</p>\n<p>“I think that we are playing a team that plays a similar style to Sac State, so we’re not having to make big adjustments to our game plan,” Vom Steeg said. “The big question for us comes down to our forwards and attacking players.”</p>\n<p>Despite the team’s success, the Gaucho front line of junior forward Sam Garza, sophomore forward David Opoku and sophomore forward Dom Sarle was unable to score a goal over the weekend. Instead it was the hat trick by junior forward Luis Silva on Friday and Sunday’s goals by junior midfielder Machael David and Pontius that allowed the Gauchos to leave Harder Stadium undefeated for the weekend.</p>\n<p>“Offensively we have more than a couple goal-scorers,” Vom Steeg said. “That helps us take the pressure off [of the forwards].”</p>\n<p>UCSB had multiple opportunities to score this past weekend against Sac State, taking an impressive 23 shots on goal, compared to the Hornets’ measly six attempts.</p>\n<p>“The point of emphasis going into league is to do more with the chances you get,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>The UCSB defense has been superb thus far, garnering five shutouts on the year. Junior goalkeeper André Grandt amassed seven total saves over the past weekend.</p>\n<p>“Our defense was good in league last year, which kept us in games,” Vom Steeg said. “Our defense will be good in league this year.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will begin league play against UCR as the No. 1 seed predicted to win the Big West Conference. Last year, the Gauchos beat UCR in the first game of the Big West Tournament en route to winning the Big West title and making a run into the postseason.</p>\n<p>“What happens is these league games become so competitive,” Vom Steeg said. “We will always get the other team’s best game, especially when we’re at their place.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff for tonight’s match against UC Riverside will take place at 7 p.m. at the UCR Soccer Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41323\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-28/gauchos-set-league-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41323\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-28/gauchos-set-league-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-28/gauchos-set-league-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-28/gauchos-set-league-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-28/gauchos-set-league-opener/","id":1757,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1756,1755,1754],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bulldogs, Britney Spears and Red Cards","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Editors Note: Julia Speace is a senior defender on the Gaucho women’s soccer team, as well as a regular contributor to the Daily Nexus with her professional sports column titled “Speace of Mind.�...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em>Editors Note: Julia Speace is a senior defender on the Gaucho women’s soccer team, as well as a regular contributor to the Daily Nexus with her professional sports column titled “Speace of Mind.” Printed in this edition of Nexus Sports is her latest entry in her weekly blog, which also appears on the Gaucho Athletics Web site.<br>\n</em></p>\n<p>So this week we only had one game, Friday night versus Fresno  State. It was our last game leading into conference, which begins this weekend. We face Riverside on Friday, and then Long Beach on Sunday- both away. But for a quick recaplet on the weekend, we played the Bulldogs to a scoreless tie through two sudden death overtimes. It is not exactly the result we wanted, but a tie is always better than a loss, I guess.</p>\n<p>I have never seen an athletic department run away with a mascot theme the way Fresno State did. They are darn proud of their mascot, which is the extremely original slobbering, teeth-baring dog with the overly-clichéd spiked collar. They had a sort of Nativity-like scene in the front with our favorite little bulldog hanging in his bulldog house with all his bulldog bones scattered around him. They had big paw prints littering the walkway leading to the field. Lastly, they had a blow up doghouse where the “lady bulldogs” ran out to enter the stadium. Wow. Somewhere in that athletic department there is a Jeff Lewis that just flipped this stadium out.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The field itself was sort of a concave shape, which I would imagine is pretty difficult to play football on. It was definitely harder to play soccer on because a rolling ball would get a little bit of loft due to the bumpiness of the ground. But hey, to each his own, and if the Fresno  State teams know how to play on it, then they should use it to their advantage. The game itself was physical, but played well on both sides. Not being biased or anything, but the only attack they had was from their goalie, who could kick it practically the length of the field. Cool. I was a little nervous that she was going to get a goal and then we were going to turn into “that team” on YouTube that got scored on by the opposing goalie. Ugh. Embarrassing. However- we didn’t suffer such a fate, and managed to keep the little soon-to-be criminologist in check. And yes, I happen to know she is doing criminology –  thanks to Fresno’s huge scoreboard that listed all the girls’ cool majors. When Britney Spears announced she wanted to get a job in forensics because, you know, “CSI is cool,” she should have gone to Fresno State. Should have gone there instead of Tarzana to that barber shop, where, you know, she sort of shaved her head. I can only imagine the long list of mystery crimes she would have solved… and how all of America could have avoided her VMA “comeback performance/debacle.” But alas, Ms. Spears has come back with a vengeance, and now will be on Glee! So all is right in my world.</p>\n<p>As the game went on, the tension and frustration mounted. Some girls are more apt to handle the pressure than others, and this could be said for Alissa Sanchez’s mark. Girlfriend went crazy,. and smacked Alissa for no reason, other than she was probably angry that Alissa was getting the best of her. Long story short, Sanch had to use some self-defense tactics, which largely consisted of holding her arms up over her head to withstand the blows that were being showered upon her. The referee, however, hopped on his “stop the violence” soapbox and decided to give red cards to both. Annoying, and wrong. But I won’t go on about the referee. I am just saying, self defense gets you off in the court of law, but not on the soccer field? Lame. Anyways, we tied 0-0, and afterwards I went home with my parents. My dad, loaded up on a Coke   and two Milky Ways, drove the four or so hours home, whilst my mother chatted away to him, and I slept. Wonderful! Win-win for everyone, I say.</p>\n<p>And that will do it for my week! Lastly, though, I will fill in gaps. Sanch, Kylie, Kat Serdio and myself, along with a gaggle of freshmen who were bored to tears by “Wall Street: blah blah I forget” saw “Easy A” on Friday. We liked it, and Emma Stone is pretty funny in it. She has some zingers, which made us chuckle. I also love me some Amanda Bynes, and so that was an added bonus to it. However, I can’t get the song “Pocketful of Sunshine” out of my head now because of it, which is annoying, to say the least. Oh well. Anyways, that’s it for me! Have a swell week, and I’ll catch you on the flipside.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26130\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-27/bulldogs-britney-spears-red-cards/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26130\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-27/bulldogs-britney-spears-red-cards/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-27/bulldogs-britney-spears-red-cards/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-27/bulldogs-britney-spears-red-cards/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-27/bulldogs-britney-spears-red-cards/","id":1758,"author":{"id":95,"name":"Julia Speace"},"related":[1757,1756,1755],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
