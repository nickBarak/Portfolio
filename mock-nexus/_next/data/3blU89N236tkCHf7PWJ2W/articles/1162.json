The two-game winning streak began at a time where the Toreros lost three straight games, with two losses coming against ranked opponents, No. 20 UCLA and No. 30 Arizona State.</p>\n<p>San Diego performed well in its last game against Brown University, where the Toreros came away with a victory at 6-1. Doubles play was strong for USD, as they clinched the doubles point in two straight sets.</p>\n<p>In singles play, the Toreros were able to win all of their matches except for one. The success in their most recent matches has given San Diego the opportunity to have a .500 record for the first time in over a month, since Feb. 5.</p>\n<p>The chance to continue their winning momentum will be a strong motive for a team that is looking to pick up its first away win of the season.</p>\n<p>After Thursday’s match against the Toreros, the Gauchos will play the No. 39 University of Denver Lady Pioneers, who are UC Santa Barbara’s first ranked opponent since their matchup against the No. 25 Washington Huskies. The Denver Lady Pioneers are 7-3 and are also coming into their match with UC Santa Barbara with a two-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>Denver’s latest game against the Oregon Ducks ended in a 4-2 victory for Denver.</p>\n<p>The Lady Pioneers pair of No. 12 junior Julia O’Loughlin and senior Maureen Slattery were victorious in that match 6-1, and the tandem will surely give the Gauchos’ own doubles pairs some trouble.</p>\n<p>Singles play has been a strong suit for Denver as it is currently on a two-game winning streak, as the team has only dropped one decision out of 10 singles matches.</p>\n<p>The team effort shown by the Gauchos this past weekend will be needed against a team that has shown an ability to succeed against talented rosters.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara will find itself traveling for a brief one-game road trip when they play against the No. 11 Pepperdine Waves.</p>\n<p>The well-equipped roster of the Waves isn’t the only problem for the Gauchos, as UCSB has seen four of its six losses come from ranked opponents.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine is the highest-ranked team the Gauchos have played against all season, and they will have to compete with some exceptional players.</p>\n<p>The Pepperdine Waves have four ranked singles players: No. 6 sophomore Luisa Stefani, No. 15 freshman Ashley Lahey, No. 27 junior Mayar Sherif Ahmed and No. 80 junior Laura Gulbe.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine also has two ranked doubles teams: No. 3 senior Christine Maddox and junior Mayar Sherif and No. 49 sophomore Luisa Stefani and senior Apichaya Runglerdkriangkrai.</p>\n<p>The talent possessed by Pepperdine will keep the Gauchos’ hands full and will make the team work hard to earn the victory.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Gauchos will play the University of San Diego Toreros on Thursday, March 9, at 10 a.m. and the University of Denver Pioneers on Friday, March 10, at 10 a.m. Santa Barbara will travel for its last game against Pepperdine on Sunday, March 12, at 11 a.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the March 9, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The efforts in doubles play from the Crimson has been successful, with the team currently on a five-game streak of earning the doubles point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The doubles play from both teams has been strong recently, and the matchup between the two looks to be fairly even, as the teams each have reliable tandems that have found their winning ways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In singles play, UCSB has been able to string together multiple winning streaks against their most recent opponents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In their games against the University of San Diego Toreros and the University of Denver Pioneers, the Gauchos stormed for four consecutive wins in their respective sets; the efforts were a significant factor in UCSB leaving with two 5-2 victories. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the team suffered a tough loss to No. 11 Pepperdine 5-2, the result in singles play against the Harvard Crimson should be much more even, especially if the Gauchos can find the winning rhythm that allowed them to dominate singles play just a weekend ago. It should be an exciting match as both teams prepare to enter conference play next week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will host Harvard University on Saturday, March 18, at 11 a.m. PST at the Rec Cen Courts.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76516\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-16/ucsb-hosts-harvard-after-loss-at-no-11-pepperdine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76516\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-16/ucsb-hosts-harvard-after-loss-at-no-11-pepperdine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-16/ucsb-hosts-harvard-after-loss-at-no-11-pepperdine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-16/ucsb-hosts-harvard-after-loss-at-no-11-pepperdine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-16/ucsb-hosts-harvard-after-loss-at-no-11-pepperdine/","id":1160,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1159,1158,1157],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Improve to 6-3, Split First Home Matches of the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MTennis_AlexYam-DSC_3956-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MTennis_AlexYam-DSC_3956-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A return to Santa Barbara ended with the UCSB men's tennis team at 1-1 over the weekend.

Mays managed to wrap up the rout of LMU with his 7-6 / 6-2 score, finalizing UCSB’s 7-0 victory on the day and marking a very successful start to their home campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was Gaucho tennis at its best on Saturday in front of a home crowd. Each player performed at peak performance in order to provide Santa Barbara with their third 7-0 sweep on the season. This momentum came deservedly so, considering Sunday’s meet would be up against a top-25 University of Oregon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following day, the Gauchos came off to a great start after earning the doubles point yet again. Mays and Freund put up an easy 6-1 victory on court one, whilst Holm and Prior also won on court three with a 6-3 score. However, court two went to Ducks sophomore Thomas Laurent and junior Cormac Clissold after a close 7-6 set. Nevertheless, the advantage point went to the in-form Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB went on to extend their lead after Mays put up a 7-5 / 6-1 victory for the first match. Oregon’s record-breaker Laurent claimed a 6-1 / 6-3 win over Moreno de Alboran, earning him his historic 16th singles win in a row. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Ducks went on to tie the meet at 2-2 once junior Akihiro Tanaka beat Freund by a score of 6-2 / 7-6. Things didn’t get better for UCSB after Clissold scraped a three-set win over Holm, 6-4 / 2-6 / 6-4. However, Masciorini tied it up at 3-3 after a three-setter of his own, 6-3 / 3-6 / 6-2.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Altogether, the meet decider depended on the final match between Oregon senior Jayson Amos and Santa Barbara’s Rakela. The streak of three-set nail biters continued as the match ended in a score of 7-5 / 1-6 / 7-5, unfortunately in favor of the visiting side, thus resulting in UCSB’s 3-4 loss on the day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Altogether, another positive weekend is in the books as UCSB manages to start their home campaign 7-0 as well as showing that they can hang with the elite, nationally ranked tennis programs that come their way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos return to action this Thursday, at home, against the Baylor Bears at 1:30 p.m. They will then face off against New Mexico on Friday.        </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Jerry West took an already stellar defensive team and added the two best defensive wings in the game. They are the favorites to win it all and it is very clear why.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. 2 Seed: Denver Nuggets</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nuggets looked like a strong team that fought and clawed its way to the No. 2 seed this prior season with a very young roster. Eventually losing in the second round in a game seven, the Nuggets added depth and athleticism with Jerami Grant. The team performed phenomenally. However, with no set small forward in their rotation and the defensive issues from starting point guard Jamal Murray, there are concerns that need to be addressed going into the next season. The Denver squad will be a very good team, but are still one or two years off from being a true contender.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. 3 seed: LA Lakers</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lakers on paper look like a very scary team. An Anthony Davis and LeBron James pick and roll is every team’s worst nightmare, especially when Danny Green is spotting up for a three in the wing. Running LeBron at the point, this roster is huge and will present a lot of problems for teams offensively and on the boards. Notice how I didn’t say defensively there. With the prevalence of stretch fives, it’s not too hard to scheme around Anthony Davis’ abilities as a rim protector. In addition, DeMarcus Cousins and LeBron James leave much to be desired defensively. Going into year 17, LeBron is definitely not playing the best defense of his career and Cousins, who was always a step slower, has just suffered two major injuries to his knee and quadricep and is thus going to be a huge asterisk defensively. Davis is also known for getting knicks and knacks here and there that keep him out for short periods of time, but in this neck-and-neck Western Conference, that will cost LA some games and their seeding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4 seed: Houston Rockets</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Houston may have started falling apart before our very eyes after being eliminated by a Kevin Durant less Warriors team. Chris Paul and James Harden are feuding because of the playstyle they play – which favors Harden and no one else. It’s clear that the players and administration have lost all faith in Head Coach Mike D’antoni and Free Agency did not go in their favor at all as they did not sign any notable Free agents and are set to run it back with almost the same team. Here’s the catch however: GM Daryl Morey might of just saved all of their blunders by trading for a league MVP and former teammate of James Harden, Russel Westbrook. Their isolation playstyle has not panned out now 3 years in a row and is unlikely to work a 4th, but with Westbrook and Hardens pre-existing chemistry and D’antoni reverting back to his Phoenix offense rather than his current iso offense, Houston has effectively reopened their window for a championship. They switched out an aging star with injury concerns to replace him with a high octane player who has a reputation for being the ironman of the NBA. There are concerns with Westbrook’s scoring efficiency, but the elite level playmaking he brings to any squad is well worth any offensive concern one might have.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. 5 seed: Utah Jazz</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Utah has been one very strong defensive unit that has stukk largely underperformed in the playoffs due to offensive inconsistencies. The addition of veteran Mike Conley Jr. and ISO scorer Bojan Bogdanovi</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ć </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">address their one glaring concern and could make Utah a dark horse threat in a close Western Conference, especially if Donovan Mitchell can take that next step and play at an all-star level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. 6 seed: Portland Trail Blazers</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Portland was notorious as a team that did really well seeding wise but could never take that next step and convert regular-season success to playoff success. All of this changed when they made the Western Conference finals last year. They accomplished this feat without their third star Jusuf Nurki</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ć</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who suffered an injury late in the season leading up to the playoffs. So why are they seeded so low? They lost one of their key roleplayers Seth Curry in Free agency and its unlikely they get the same production from Rodney Hood going forward. Nurkic who was already a defensive liability has just taken a lower leg injury which won’t bode well defensively. The Trail Blazers 2 man duo of Lillard and McCollum can only carry this team so far on their own without a clear cut third option, and adding Hasan Whiteside who is little more than an elite rebounder does little to solve this problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7 seed: Golden State Warriors</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know what you’re saying, they made the finals the last 5 years straight how are they suddenly a 7 seed. Losing Kevin Durant is bad, especially since Klay Thompson is injured as well, but on top of this the Dubs lost backup guard Quinn Cook, Shaun Livingston, and Andre Iguodala. All of that and the only addition is D’angelo Russel. Yes Russel is an All Star, yes he is an exciting young player. But the fit next to Steph is frankly terrible. Both are defensive liabilities and D’angelo Russel is extremely pick and roll dependent while the Warriors run very little Pick and Roll and instead prefer a very fluid ball movement offense. Also what’s Russels fit when Klay comes back? Are Steph, Klay, and Russel going to be on the court together, if so that lineup will be extremely undersized especially compared to the rest of the Western Conference teams, which all have notable size to take advantage of smaller lineups. Furthermore the Raptors showed how easy it was to neutralize Curry when he was the sole offensive option with a Box and 1 Defense. In conclusion the warriors lost their best player to Free Agency as well as the little depth that they had to add a player who is ill fitting to their game plan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8 seed: Sacramento Kings</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Kings have done a lot of things right in the last few years. They got rid of bad contracts and built a deep young team from the draft and brought in pieces to facilitate their young nucleus’ growth. They have stellar perimeter play from Bogdan Bogdonovic (not to be confused with Bojan Bogdonovic), Buddy Hield, and De’aaron Fox as well as a versatile and athletic front court with Marvin Bagley III and Dewane Dedmon. This team then resigns a talented young wing in Harrison Barnes and signs veteran perimeter defender Trevor Ariza – while also adding depth to the backcourt by adding Corey Joseph. This team was trending toward a playoff berth without all of their additions, but with their recent acquisitions the Kings are poised to take the next step while also allowing their young core enough freedom to continue their development.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89332\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-16/how-the-west-stacks-up-conference-seeding-predictions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89332\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-16/how-the-west-stacks-up-conference-seeding-predictions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-16/how-the-west-stacks-up-conference-seeding-predictions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-16/how-the-west-stacks-up-conference-seeding-predictions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-16/how-the-west-stacks-up-conference-seeding-predictions/","id":1159,"author":{"id":23,"name":"Nithesh Perumal"},"related":[1158,1157,1156],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
