The NFL has become so deeply ingrained into American culture that the Super Bowl has become a national holiday, and even traditional holidays such as Thanksgiving are commonly centered around “the game” for many families. Statistically, the sports industry has never seen an economic powerhouse like the NFL before, with its annual revenue coming in at roughly $13 billion.</p>\n<p>Regardless of its clear-cut dominance in viewership and revenue, NFL ratings are down. The recent political  controversies surrounding the sport have been nothing but bad news for fans, players and owners across the country. In contrast to these issues, the NBA and its players have procured a huge growth in interest worldwide. The NBA will surpass the NFL as America’s most popular sport within the next five years.</p>\n<p>When it comes to modern-day popularity contests, the first place to look is social media clout. The NFL Network and NBArank of ESPN both recently came out with a list of the top 100 players for 2018. The top 10 NFL stars on the list have an accumulated 14.4 million followers on Instagram, with Tom Brady having the most on the list at 4.2 million followers. The top 10 ranked NBA players, on the other hand, have a staggering 107 million instagram followers in total. LeBron James himself has nearly <em>three times</em> the amount of followers as the top 10 NFL superstars <em>combined</em>.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In a culture full of icons and celebrities, the NBA simply has more enticing characters that the fans want to keep up to date with.</p>\n<p>The enormous margin between the NFL and NBA on social media attests to the idea that fans already find basketball to be their favorite sport. NBA players have created personal brands that allow the fans to be more connected to the game, and because of that the blue checks are stacking up enormously compared to the media presence of NFL stars.</p>\n<p>Heck, J.R. Smith’s Hennessy memes and Carmelo Anthony’s hoodie are getting more air time on the internet than NFL stars nowadays. The future of all entertainment is in the development of social media, and the NBA is clearly dominating that sector.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the biggest problem leading to the NFL’s demise is the prevalence of not only season-ending injuries but also life-ending injuries. Repetitive brain trauma has been proven to result in violent mood swings, depression and many other cognitive difficulties.</p>\n<p>Aaron Hernandez, a former tight-end for the New England Patriots, was convicted for the murder of Odin Lloyd and eventually hung himself in prison at the age of 27 years old. He had severe and late stages of CTE in his brain. His family is now suing the Patriots and the NFL on the grounds that they “were fully aware of the damage that could be inflicted from repetitive impact injuries and failed to disclose, treat or protect him from the dangers of such damage.” Brain damage of players in the NFL is an epidemic, one that will take away from the game in a multitude of ways.</p>\n<p>One of the medical pioneers of CTE, Dr. Bennet Omalu, spoke with NFL personnel who told him, “If 10 percent of mothers in this country would perceive football as a dangerous sport, that is the end of football.” Even now we see that former players are speaking out against their kids playing the game, such as Troy Aikman, who was quoted on HBO saying: “If I had a 10-year-old boy, I don’t know that I’d be real inclined to encourage him to go play football, in light of what we are learning from head injury.”</p>\n<p>In response to this health crisis, the NFL has altered the rules of the game significantly over the years, but this in itself is a problem. More penalties slow the flow of the game, alter the outcome in a non-competitive way and eliminate the intrinsic excitement of violence in the fans’ and players’ beloved game. In the NBA, the worst injuries in recent history were those of Gordon Hayward or Shaun Livingston, who are both back on the court ready to compete for a championship this upcoming season with little to no lifelong damage to their bodies.</p>\n<p>Many of those concerned for the health of their son or daughter are going to be more than willing to put them on a basketball court and extremely fearful of letting them get hit on the football field. In a world that is becoming increasingly less tolerant and less attracted to violence, basketball is becoming the most viable athletic option for both the families and the players.</p>\n<p>Let’s face it, this country is dedicated to the people who are getting paid, and NBA players are getting paid by the likes of which we have never seen before. In Forbes’ list of the top 100 richest athletes in the world, there are 40 NBA players and just a mere 16 who represent the NFL.</p>\n<p>Not only are contracts for playing basketball at an all-time high, but NBA players are also signing much larger endorsements. This means they have become significantly more valuable to companies’ public image and ability to sell products due to their popularity.</p>\n<p>In 2018, LeBron James will receive $52 million and Steph Curry will pull in $42 million from endorsements. This is more than they will make from their basketball contracts. The top endorsed NFL players are Drew Brees with $11 million and Eli Manning with $8 million — a fraction of what NBA superstars are making annually. The brand image of NBA players have hit an all-time high because the popularity of basketball is increasing rapidly worldwide. Even when Madden 2018 was being advertised this past year, they used NBA players James Harden and Chris Paul in the commercial promoting it. Oh, and according to Forbes, “NBA 2k18” just hit a new record of over 10 million copies sold, ranking it the number seven bestselling game of the year, whereas “Madden” didn’t even make the top 10. Companies are utilizing this newfound popularity to boost their company’s sales and are leaving NFL players out because they aren’t what’s “hot” right now. NBA players are taking business into their own hands as well, as seen in the pinnacle of business-minded athletes such as Michael Jordan, who is worth $1.4 billion and is now the world’s richest athlete ever. Basketball players are not just playing sports; they are creating companies and becoming ubiquitous in corporate advertising— all of which promote the status of the NBA.</p>\n<p>NBA players are redefining pop culture in a way that the NFL is not. Politically, the NBA has always been at the forefront of progressive ideas, whether it be the Golden State Warriors boycotting the White House visit, LeBron James’s infamous tweet toward Trump or the countless philanthropic charities and donations made by players all over the league. The NFL, on the other hand, has refused to give roster slots to Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid for “standing” up against police brutality, yet it continues to provide careers for countless players charged with sexual assault, domestic violence and DUIs.</p>\n<p>NBA players also stay active in the entertainment industry outside of basketball, from the newest collaboration of Dame Dolla and Lil Wayne to Kyrie Irving’s new movie “Uncle Drew” to even more serious ventures like LeBron James’s new docuseries called “Shut Up and Dribble.” They are constantly using their charismatic personalities to enter other fields of the entertainment industry, and this trend is only going upwards from here. Fashion is probably the most influenced by NBA players as well. Brands like Jordan, Nike and Adidas all flock to NBA stars to push athletic gear off their shelves. Even Lavar Ball’s antics have allowed Big Baller Brand to reach a cult following in the fashion industry globally. After all, when’s the last time you bought anything from Tom Brady’s brand? You haven’t. Basketball players have always held a fun-loving stereotype, which has left us with stylish shoes, hilarious memes, countless rap songs and, most importantly, strong role models. The NFL sells itself as a logo and rarely contributes to life outside of the realm of football.</p>\n<p>If I had to invest in one of them, I would put my money into the NBA every time.</p>\n<p><em>A

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Following a summer filled with determination and growth, the Santa Barbara Gauchos have returned to the gym with ambition and high hopes for the upcoming season. While UCSB came up short last year in the Big West Tournament, the squad is eager to build on the biggest program turnaround in college basketball last year.</p>\n<p>It’s no coincidence that the team’s turnaround came at the same time that Coach Joe Pasternack took over the head coaching duties. After previous coaching positions at storied programs such as the University of Arizona and UC Berkeley, Pasternack took his second head coaching job with UCSB in March of 2017.</p>\n<p>As he took the helm, there was an instant shift in the culture of UCSB basketball. Pasternack stretched his recruiting range by adding a plethora of veteran graduate students and transfer players, and Santa Barbara eyed epic success on the hardwood once again.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although four of the five starters from last year’s historic squad departed in the offseason, the Gauchos ushered in another wave of transfer students who are keen on making an immediate impact on the team. The lone incumbent starter, junior guard Max Heidegger, has assumed a prominent leadership role as a weathered Gaucho to welcome his incoming teammates.</p>\n<p>“We have seven or eight new guys,” Heidegger explained. “We’re [focused] on building camaraderie, getting everyone into our system and doing what Coach P. expects from us.”</p>\n<p>Of those players who made the move to sunny Santa Barbara, the majority of the transfer additions are guards and wings. Spearheaded by sophomore point guard Devearl Ramsey, who redshirted last year after a move from the University of Nevada, and graduate transfer Ar’mond Davis, who brings tournament experience after his March Madness run with the University of Alabama last season, the new faces plan to make a significant impact early in the year.</p>\n<p>“It makes practice competitive,” Heidegger joked. “Offense, get to the rim, do what we did last year; obviously we were the best offense in the Big West.” Heidegger harped on the team’s focus for the upcoming year: “Defense, defense, defense … When I talk about what Coach P. wants for the culture, it’s all about playing defense and playing hard; that’s what we’re getting everybody to do.”</p>\n<p>As the transfer guards get situated in their new roles and fight for a spot on the starting rotation, the Gauchos have also integrated a myriad of young talent into the program at the forward position.</p>\n<p>The freshmen forward duo of Jay Nagle and Amadou Sow tower over opponents at 6’8” and 6’9” respectively. As if the Twin Tower additions weren’t enough, the Gauchos continued to reinforce their front court this offseason when the team introduced sophomore forward Robinson Idehen, a native Spaniard who staggers at a whopping 6’10”.</p>\n<p>As the big men get situated in their new digs, who better to mentor the young forwards than fifth-year senior center Ami Lakoju? With a first-hand look at the paradigm shift between Coach Williams and Coach Pasternack, Lakoju is the ideal guide to transition the new recruits into the culture that UCSB basketball is currently rebuilding.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot of young talent,” Lakoju beamed. “If you make a mistake, just brush it off. You have to focus on executing your job. Everybody has their own role.”</p>\n<p>The veteran big man had a career year last season playing in all 32 matches for the Gauchos, including starting seven games, as he facilitated in the absence of Jalen Canty. As he battles back from an offseason toe injury, Lakoju suggested that his game continues to evolve under Coach Pasternack.</p>\n<p>“Mentally I’ve seen players grow under each coaching staff,” Lakoju observed. “I feel like the game is so mental. As a freshman, I didn’t really see it that way … if you’re strong mentally, physically you can do anything.”</p>\n<p>The complement of veteran leadership and young talent makes for a deadly combination. With Coach Joe Pasternack at the reigns, this Gaucho team reflects a shut-down defense along with an offensive attack that sends shivers down the spines of every Big West coach.</p>\n<p>While most teams would have a bleak outlook on this season following the departure of four starters, this Santa Barbara squad has unusually high potential in the upcoming year. With the recent talent brought in for the 2019 season, the Gauchos have high expectations for a successful Big West campaign and a deep run in postseason play.</p><div

After years of depressing dead-end rosters, the Kings finally have a team of exciting young talent. </span><span style=\"color: black;\">Second-year point guard De’Aaron Fox, possibly the quickest player in the NBA, got a jump shot in the offseason and looked like a real-life point guard in preseason. The Kings haven’t had one of those since they traded Isaiah Thomas for Alex Oriakhi, who currently plays in Mexico.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 12.25pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Marvin Bagley III was the No. 2 pick of the 2018 NBA draft and could be a franchise big man with his incredible bounce and touch around the rim. He can’t really use his right hand on offense and is so bad at defense that Duke had to revamp its entire system for him, but it was definitely still smart to pick Bagley over Luka Doncic, 19-year-old reigning Euroleague MVP.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 12.25pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">The sleeper young talent, however, is Harry Giles. The 20th pick of the 2017 NBA draft, Giles was the top-rated high school player in a recruiting class that included Jayson Tatum and Lonzo Ball, but multiple knee surgeries on both knees cut his sole season at Duke short and pushed him down in the draft.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 12.25pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">The Kings played it safe last season and kept Giles on the shelf all year, but news came out around the All-Star Break that he was dominating practices. We’ve seen him play in Summer League and preseason now, and he’s lived up to the hype.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 12.25pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">He’s still athletic with ball skills and a point guard’s passing vision, all of which are reasons he was billed as a new-age Chris Webber in high school. He’s got a jump shot, too, which means he’s a ball-handling seven-footer who can rebound, pass] and knock down threes. He’s also a pretty good defender, if you’re into that.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 12.25pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">A quick heads up: When you become a Kings fan, you also have to become a devout Harry Giles apostle. You’ll notice every Kings fan online is devoted to spreading the word of Giles. He’s that good, and we also haven’t had a reason to hope for so long.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 12.25pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Fox, Bagley and Giles make for a good young core, along with a supporting cast of players like Buddy Hield, Bogdan Bogdanovic and Frank Mason. The team won’t be good this year, but they’ll certainly be fun and interesting to watch.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 12.25pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Speaking of which, I should mention how bad they’re going to be this year. It’s important to me that you know what you’re signing up for as a Sacramento Kings fan. They’re going to be the worst or second worst team in the Western Conference and one of the five worst teams in the league. </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

During the Timberwolves practice session, Jimmy was seen calling out teammates, coaches, as well as Minnesota’s General Manager Scott Layden.</p>\n<p>To the basketball world, Butler is seen as a poised and collected player with a strong IQ for the game. Moreover, he is labeled as a leader that acts as the glue that keeps the team together. Quite frankly, he is the last person that anyone would expect to belittle his teammates, which means there must be valid reasons for doing so.</p>\n<p>Throughout his seven year career, Butler has worked tirelessly to put himself in the conversation of the best players in the league. After four straight years of not only being a lockdown defender but also averaging over 20 points per game, it seemed only fitting that he be offered a hefty contract by the team that had not made the playoffs for 14 years until he had arrived. As contract talks stalled, Butler clearly felt betrayed as he mentioned in an interview with ESPN’s Rachel Nichols.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s about saying we need you. We want you here. We can’t do this without you,”, he explained. “And that was the disconnect all along. You’re saying one thing. I mean I’ve learned enough times in life that saying something is completely different than acting upon it.”</p>\n<p>Although this quote explains his frustration with management, it does not bring to light why he was frustrated with his teammates. Butler would later explain this in the same interview when asked if he felt his teammates did not have winning as their top priority.</p>\n<p>“If your No. 1 priority isn’t winning, and people can tell? That’s the battle,”  he explains. “Now, there’s a problem between people because that guy’s No. 1 priority is winning and that guy’s isn’t. Of course they’re gonna clash, like, ‘I’m doing this for the team. Are you?’ ‘Ehh.’ Exactly. So, that’s where the disconnect is.”</p>\n<p>Before Butler became a Timberwolf, it was very clear that Minnesota was underachieving as they had two number one picks on the same roster, in Karl Anthony-Towns and Andrew Wiggins, yet they could not break into the top eight spots in the Western Conference. Minnesota wanted Butler to change the culture in the locker room to where there was an expectation to win but it seems apparent now that not everyone on the team has bought into that culture.</p>\n<p>The dispute between Butler and the organization does not seem to be coming to an end anytime soon as Butler has made it very clear that he wants to be traded immediately. To some, it may be comprehended as him quitting on the team, but that could not be farther from the truth. If Butler could take the third stringers and beat the starters in a scrimmage during practice, it is apparent that winning is not a top priority for the players on the team.</p>\n<p>With Butler turning 30 this year, his years for competing for championships and continuing to play at a high level are numbered. For him, he simply does not want to waste his best years on a team that does not have the same desire to compete as he does.</p>\n<p>As the Timberwolves face the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday night, it will be interesting to see the dynamic between not only Butler and his teammates but also Butler and the coaching staff as well. Perhaps, this lights a fire under his teammates and this becomes the year Minnesota finally lives up to their potential. More likely however, Jimmy Butler will be traded and Minnesota will fall back to being a middle of the pack team in the West.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on page 9 of the Oct. 18 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84399\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/in-defense-of-jimmy-butler/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84399\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/in-defense-of-jimmy-butler/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/in-defense-of-jimmy-butler/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/in-defense-of-jimmy-butler/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/in-defense-of-jimmy-butler/","id":1002,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[1001,1000,999],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
