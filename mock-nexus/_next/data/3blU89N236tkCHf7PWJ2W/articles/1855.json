The program suspended seven study abroad programs in Europe earlier on March 12 and plans to officially suspend 30 more programs on March 16 as the U.S. Department of State and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued warnings against international travel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of March 16, programs in the Czech Republic, Costa Rica, Ghana, Jordan, Ireland, England and Scotland had also been suspended. On March 17 and 18, UCEAP announced its program in Chile and its programs in Brazil and Japan were also suspended. </span></p>\n<p>On March 19, UCEAP said all summer study abroad programs had been suspended as well.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC policy mandates that study abroad programs be suspended if there are Level 3 Travel Advisories, or “Avoid Nonessential Travel” for a country. As of Thursday, nine countries in Europe have now been given a </span><a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/coronavirus-europe#countries\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level 3

abroad programs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — China, South Korea and Italy — had been suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>\n<p>UCEAP spokesperson Myla Edmond said that as of March 13, 980 students had been impacted by these program suspensions.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The spring quarter programs that have been suspended as of today

wrote on its website that all summer 2020 study abroad programs would continue as scheduled except:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biodiversity, National University of Singapore, Singapore</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">China summer 2020 programs</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span

Thailand</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel noted that the time difference made it difficult for her family, who often heard about news like Trump’s travel suspension while she was asleep. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They hear about everything before I do, and they’re freaking out for me, and I’m trying to calm them down from another continent,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For some students and their families, the stress of not knowing when — not if, when — the program would be canceled was too much to bear. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of my friends, her dad was freaking out and she’s going home tomorrow morning,” she said. “He called her yesterday and was like ‘I can’t handle this anymore, I don’t even know if your program’s gonna get cancelled but I’m buying you a ticket to come home.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that the programs have officially been canceled, UCEAP has been working with both the host universities abroad and the students’ home UC campuses to coordinate course credit, financial aid and all the other lingering questions that remain for these students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel said she was told by her study abroad advisor that UCEAP was attempting to convert the study abroad courses to online courses, so students could finish their semesters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But that sounds so impossible to me,” she said, while acknowledging that it would be her best option.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once she received the official cancelation email from UCEAP, Pimentel said she would probably book her flight home for late next week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t imagine having to crash courses if we can’t even be on campus until the end of April,” she said. “I don’t know how I would go about getting myself into classes. I also don’t know how I would handle housing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, Pimentel is focusing on enjoying her last few days abroad. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know, I just don’t want to come home. It’s two months early, and it’s really disappointing and really sad, but I just keep trying to remind myself that it could be worse,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><em>Updated: [3/19/20 3:45 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated: [3/17/20 3:02 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated: [3/16/20 11:30 a.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated: [3/14/20 2:12 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

CSD is currently in communication with UCSB, Santa Barbara City College, the County of Santa Barbara and public health officials to determine the new date for the community festival.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The now-defunct festival would have shared similar features to a carnival; the event would have included a rock wall, a water balloon toss, face-painting, local bands and free food provided by various I.V. businesses, according to Armistead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been directed on our campus not to host any events. In fact, most of everything’s canceled in April,” Armistead said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is unknown how UCSB’s decision will affect the annual Deltopia, an unsanctioned street party planned for April 4.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The thing is about Deltopia proper, the unsanctioned events, it’s really up to those who live in Isla Vista to decide when they want to do with [Deltopia]. So we’re going to keep eyes on it in terms of making sure our community is safe,” Armistead added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said that despite the delays, the planning for the festival did serve to lay the foundation for a festival in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is a silver lining here,” Brandt explained. “We’ve done, essentially, all the legwork that we needed to get to a point where the community festival will become a reality and where we will be able to transition folks into an alternative event that is fun, that is safe and changes the vibe of what’s going on during Deltopia weekend in a significant way for the better.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
