Childress, a Class of 2017 graduate, was the team’s only senior last season. The final chapter of his collegiate career wasn’t the happiest farewell as the Gauchos went a horrid 6-22, 4-12 in Big West play.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since departing from UCSB, Childress has continued to play overseas. A native of Hawthorne, Calif., Childress is a long way from home. But his passion for basketball is the drive that keeps him motivated to continue to chase his dream of playing basketball.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although I was unable to conduct an in-person interview with Childress due to his overseas travels, being able to complete this Q&amp;A session with him was an experience in itself.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Before we begin here is the highlight tape of his first year overseas, enjoy: <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pP8XeyfsGqo\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><br>\n<em><strong>Sean White: How was your experience playing in the British Basketball League? How was the transition from college to overseas?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Eric Childress: </strong>Playing in the British Basketball League was pretty difficult. I say this only because I feel like the club I was with had the potential to be very talented, but we underperformed and many different circumstances made it hard for us to reach our potential. The transition from college to overseas, I’d say, can be different for every person depending on the country you land in. For me, going to the U.K., I was very fortunate in going to a place where everyone spoke English and it was the most similar to the U.S. With that being said, if I were to start my career somewhere in Asia, South America or even here in Georgia I think I would have struggled at first because of the language barrier and it being such a big culture shock. It’s hard for me to just maneuver around town like I was in Leeds.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: Did you get in touch with any former Gauchos who play or have played overseas prior to starting your pro career?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>Yeah, prior to leaving I talked to players like James Nunally &amp; Orlando Johnson, who came back to Santa Barbara during the summer, and kind of picked their brains about the whole overseas experience. Also, it’s easier for me to get in contact with Alan Williams, Nate Garth, Zalmico Harmon and Michael Bryson, so whenever I have a big question that I feel like I can’t really get on my own I’ll reach out and see if they can offer me some advice from their experiences.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: How did you know at the time that Leeds Force was the right fit for you? Did you have an agent help with that choice?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>I feel like you never really know which team is the right fit until you get there. You kind of watch film of the league and past seasons, but ultimately the guys you see from the last season are likely gone to another country or [have] signed with another team in the league. When I got to Leeds I had no clue what I was getting myself into. We had, of course, your local players for the team, and many imports, as they call us, from different places such as Houston and Florida in the States, then a player for Greece, one from Switzerland, one from Lithuania and one from Germany. So it’s more on the club to make sure our playing styles complement each other when they offer us to play for them. My choice to go play for Leeds was made by my agent and me. We felt like the U.K. was a good starting place for me to go because of the similarities to the U.S., and the British Basketball League (BBL) is a good league with many talented players.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: I see you’re no longer a member of Leeds Force? Was that by choice or was it a matter of both sides just not being able to agree?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>After giving Leeds a shot, the club and I both agreed that things weren’t going in the direction we hoped for and mutually decided to go our separate ways. I wish those guys the best over there for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: You played with guys like Alan “Big Al” Williams, Michael Bryson and more. How often do you stay in touch with them? Do you ever seek advice from them for anything?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>One of the greatest things about UCSB — and I commend Coach Williams for this — was that he brought in some of the best dudes I’ll ever meet. With that being said, I speak to pretty much all my teammates from the past days because of the old group chats that we had in college and are still active in. As far as advice, I try to figure out some stuff on my own. If I can’t get it and [am] really struggling, then I’ll reach out to them or even old high school family such as my coaches and old teammates and see what advice they can offer me in this experience.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: Have you had a chance to peep this year’s men’s basketball team? If so, what have your thoughts been especially since the program now has a new head coach in Joe Pasternack?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>This year’s team has been amazing. I’m really happy for those guys that had to go through that tough season last year and [am] juiced for Gabe [Vincent] to be out there performing great after that injury last year. Glad to see Jalen [Canty] and Ami [Lakoju] out there on the floor after their situation last year as well. I can’t even lie: I was jealous, and I told them this when watching them play against Cal State Fullerton this year. Their play style differs so much from ours last year that it really seems like those dudes that are on the floor are genuinely having fun with the game, and I feel like the most important [thing] is having fun while competing at a high level. I’m happy they adjusted to Coach P’s system so quickly, and I think he did an outstanding job with those guys with getting them to compete on both ends of the floor.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: What’s next for Eric Childress? I see you’ve recently announced your signing with a team in the country of Georgia; what convinced you to do so?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>Yes, I recently signed to play and finish my rookie year here in Batumi, Georgia with BC Batumi. The biggest thing was that I didn’t want what happened in Leeds to affect my love for the game. I’ve been playing and giving my all to this sport for as long as I can remember, and it’s always been a dream of mine to be a professional basketball player. That was the biggest choice in deciding to come here and continue on. What also factored in was realizing that I get to travel the world, see many different places and cultures, try different things and gain new experiences that many people aren’t fortunate [enough] to do, so I’m blessed to even have this opportunity.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: Any good or unfamiliar meals overseas that you liked or disliked?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>As for as meals go, I’m one of the pickiest eaters you’ll ever meet. Shout-out to my mom and pops for teaching me how to cook. I feel like one day I’ll venture out and try something new, but if it doesn’t pass the smell test, I don’t think it’s for me.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Feb.

win at a score of 6-4.</p>\n<p>Senior April Scatliffe and junior Priscila Garcia battled hard on the No. 1 doubles court with the match coming down to the wire. Late in the game the referee made a potentially game changing call by taking a point away from the Gaels, ruling that it was an illegal hit that scored them the point, with the players racquet crossing the net and making contact with the ball on the Gauchos’ side of the court.  The ruling came at match point for the Gaels and provided a lifeline for UCSB to possibly win the match.  However, the Gauchos ended up losing the match the next point at a score of 4-6.</p>\n<p>Yet, the Gauchos certainly took advantage of the home fixture, rising above what was expected of them to win the match against a very tough opponent.</p>\n<p>Adler captured the No. 1 singles match against senior Danielle Flores in the third set 6-3.  On the No. 2 court, Gilbertson dropped the first set 2-6, but came back in the second to give a dominant performance, winning 6-0.  She finished in the third set winning the match 6-1.</p>\n<p>April Scatliffe lost in two sets at identical scores of 6-4, 6-4 to the Gaels’ sophomore Jana McCord, while sophomore Melissa Baker also lost in two sets of 6-4, 6-4.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos match was then decided between senior Stacy Yam and Da Silveira.  Yam won her first set 7-5, going on to lose the second at a score of 3-6.  Yam won the decisive tie breaker 6-2 against the Gaels’ sophomore Parminder Kaul, giving Parminder her first singles loss of the season.</p>\n<p>After Yam secured the No. 6 singles match for the Gauchos, all eyes turned to court four, as Da Silveira battled against junior Jamie Pawid to decide the outcome of the match.  Da Silveira went on to win the match for the Gauchos in the third set, giving UCSB an important victory over a top team early in the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next match is against San Jose State at home next Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The UCSB men’s tennis team suffered a couple of tough losses on the road trip this past weekend. On Saturday, the Gauchos fell to the University of San Diego 4-3 and on Sunday to UC Irvine by the same score.</p>\n<p>With these two losses, UCSB falls to a record of 2-4 with all four losses coming on the road. The Gauchos start conference off 0-1 with the loss to Irvine.</p>\n<p>The match with the highly ranked Toreros team was an exciting one with close competition all around. Of the six singles matches that were played, five of them went to three full sets before a victor was established. The only match that was settled in two sets was won by sophomore Teague Hamilton, who played on the sixth court and gave the Gauchos their first point of the day. His win tied the score at one apiece as UCSB’s consistent struggles in doubles play downed them a point to start the match.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Along with Hamilton, senior Tobias Galskov and junior Nathan Eshmade were able to provide their team with two more points, which evened the count at 3-3 with just one more singles match to be completed. Galskov’s win was particularly impressive as the senior reclaimed his singles spot on the number one court and took on the No. 53 junior Uros Petronijevic. Galskov was burned 6-1 in the first set and retaliated to win the next two sets 6-4 and 6-2 to grab the victory over his ranked opponent. Unfortunately, these strong performances were not enough to secure the match victory as the teams split the singles matches 3-3 and the doubles point pushed the Toreros past the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>After a heated competition with a ranked opponent, UCSB opened up conference play with the Anteaters of Irvine. The Gauchos started the match on a high note, winning the doubles point for just the second time this season and giving them a 1-0 boost on the day. Wins came from the teams of Galskov and sophomore Erik Johnsson as well as sophomore Morgan Mays and junior Andrew Riminton. They took doubles wins by scores of 6-3 and 6-4, respectively.</p>\n<p>The singles game is where the Gauchos faltered on the day, as they were only able to win two of their six matches. Hamilton was a bright spot for the team as he continued his momentum from the previous meet and once again defeated his opponent, this time in the number five court for the Gauchos. Although his victory came in two straight sets, they were hard fought as his Irvine opponent nearly held him off in both, going 7-6 and 7-5.</p>\n<p>The other Gaucho to pick up a win for his team was freshman Cody Rakela in a very interesting matchup on court three. Rakela just edged out his opponent in the first set winning 7-6 and then proceeded to be dropped in the next set by a score of 6-1. With the match on the line, Rakela repeated his first set performance and won 7-6 once more.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to pick up their undefeated home record when they host Loyola Marymount University this Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

tough road trip when it takes on Loyola Marymount University Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Heading into this match, the Gauchos hold a record of 2-4 while the Lions stand at 2-2 on the season.</p>\n<p>After another disappointing weekend on the road, Santa Barbara will look to continue its home success and extend its unbeaten record when competing at the Rec Cen courts. So far this season, the Gauchos have been unable to grab any wins outside of their home courts, as their away record sits at 0-4, but playing in Santa Barbara has been a completely different story. In the two matches that the Gauchos have hosted, they took down respectable opponents in crosstown rival Westmont College and a then ranked San Diego State team.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Without a doubt, playing at home is always easier,” sophomore player Morgan Mays explained. “The comfort of your own bed and being able to prepare with your regular routine, not to mention the fans, gives any team a boost.”</p>\n<p>Mays himself has definitely used the fuel from these boosts in his trials on the home court. As a singles competitor, the sophomore is unbeaten in his two matches at home even in playing on the number one ranked court for his team in both.</p>\n<p>He also took both of them in straight sets, beating Westmont’s number one player 6-1, 6-2 and San Diego State’s best athlete 6-4, 6-4. Along with that, he helped the Gauchos to their only doubles win of the season, which came against SDSU and was achieved when Mays and his junior partner Andrew Riminton clinched the third match 6-4.</p>\n<p>Back into the action for UCSB is senior leader Tobias Galskov, whom has traded back and forth with Mays this season for the number one spot on the team. After a couple of tough early losses for this veteran, which was followed by a quick leave of absence, Galskov is back competing for his Gauchos. This battle with LMU will be just his second time competing at home this season in the singles event and he will be looking to capitalize on his first home victory to help push his team over the Lions. He is more than capable of doing so as he is recently coming off of a huge individual win over No. 53 junior Uros Petronijevic, which he forced to three sets after dropping the first.</p>\n<p>The Lions will not be a team to walk over as they come into Saturday’s events riding a two-match win streak. The Lion’s two victories were achieved at home in two dominant 7-0 sweeps of Grand Canyon College and Sacramento State, respectively. This team has not picked up a road win all season so far, but will get another shot when they face the Gauchos this weekend.</p>\n<p>Doubles matches are set to start at 1 p.m. on Saturday at the Rec Cen courts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Daniel is a beat writer for the UCSB men’s tennis team.
