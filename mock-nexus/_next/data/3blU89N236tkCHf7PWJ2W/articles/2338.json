The staff referenced a Nov. 14 incident when the center’s associate director was fired and removed from the Student Resource Building without warning.</p>\n<p>The RCSGD was immediately removed from underneath its umbrella organization and the university administration agreed to a freestanding building that would house the new RCSGD, as well as several other demands that included a doubling of the program’s budget.</p>\n<p>The organization’s current name will be changed later this year.</p>\n<p>“The RCSGD title had previously fit the student body but may no longer accommodate the communities’ needs,” said Hikaru Ezra Mernin, the Transforce task coordinator.</p>\n<p>Mernin explained that it may be difficult for students to tell their friends or family members “I work at the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity,” which is why a slightly more ambiguous or “non-outing” title should be established.</p>\n<p>They also said that the lack of adequate assistance has made tasks “more complex” and has been “hindering the RCGSD’s progress.”</p>\n<p>Students also expressed concern about the graduate student hiring process. Many felt that undergraduates should be able to work with the administration to determine which candidates may be a good fit.</p>\n<p>RCSGD office manager Ogui Gonzalez said the “student voices are currently not centered and students should be able to put in their input and be involved in the interview process.”</p>\n<p>In addition to increased participation in the hiring process, students requested upperclassmen housing for queer and transgender students.</p>\n<p>Diversity Programs Director Carlos Nash said that this may be implemented in the future because the housing faculty members are already planning to incorporate Living Learning Communities into upperclassmen housing.</p>\n<p>“The Newman Housing Queer and Trans Cooperative in Isla Vista is currently taking applications, and interested students should apply as soon as they can,” Mernin said.</p>\n<p>Currently, the Newman House provides LGBTQ students with the chance to live in an inclusive environment and to meet other people from the community.</p>\n<p>RCGD staff member Johari Hunt also introduced the RCGSD’s new mentorship program. Any interested student can apply to be a mentee, and faculty members are encouraged to volunteer as mentors. Students can find more information on the RCSGD website or Facebook page.</p>\n<p>All students are also welcome to stop by the RCSGD centers or contact Ogui Gonzalez at <em>ogui.gonzalezvila@sa.ucsb.edu</em> for more information about upcoming opportunities.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Mernin’s full name is Hikaru Erza Mernin, not Erza Mernin as previously stated. </em></p>\n<p><i>Correction: Dumlao is the RCSGD diversity education facilitator, not the RCSGD office manager as previously stated. </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80644\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/rcsgd-discusses-future-at-queer-town-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80644\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/rcsgd-discusses-future-at-queer-town-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/rcsgd-discusses-future-at-queer-town-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/rcsgd-discusses-future-at-queer-town-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/rcsgd-discusses-future-at-queer-town-hall/","id":2338,"author":{"id":206,"name":"Maya Chandy"},"related":[2337,2336,2335],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":206,"name":"Maya Chandy","biography":"Not available","articles":[2338],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Sexual Assault Reported in UCSB Student Housing","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-01-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/campus.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/campus.jpg?resize=740%2C325&ssl=1","description":"A UC Santa Barbara student reported an attempted sexual assault on Monday in her room at on-campus student housing, according to a university alert sent out Thursday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A UC Santa Barbara student reported an attempted sexual assault on Monday in her room at on-campus student housing, according to a university alert sent out Thursday evening.</p>\n<p>The suspect allegedly “refused to leave the victim’s room,” the UCSB Police Department (UCPD) said in the alert.

They will also receive an advisor and a significant increase in funding.</p>\n<p>The resolution was authored by Matt Nielson, vice chair of the TSA, Julian Armada, chair of the TSA and Kian Maalizadeh and Ilene Ochoa, who are both A.S. Senate liaisons to the organization.</p>\n<p>The four worked on the resolution during Fall Quarter and filed a motion to get the TSA certified as a BCU.</p>\n<p>The amount of funding the TSA will receive is still being discussed. According to Armada, Maalizadeh first suggested that the budget should be around $20,000, but then expectations were lowered to $10,000.</p>\n<p>When the TSA was an entity of the Office of Student Life (OSL), their budget was no larger than $500, Armada explained.</p>\n<p>Prior to the TSA becoming an A.S. entity, they received their funding solely from fundraisers and donations.</p>\n<p>“We had to spend a lot of time raising money before we even put on events,” Nielson said.</p>\n<p>The TSA had their first meeting as a BCU on Monday, Feb. 12. Armada said he had seen an increase in membership since the TSA officially became a BCU.</p>\n<p>“It’s small now, but I’m hoping that their interest will keep growing,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We’re one of the only UCs who didn’t have a transfer organization as a part of the Associated Students… That was shocking to me considering how many transfer students are being accepted, and it’s only increasing each year,” he added.</p>\n<p>The previous board of the TSA had intended to make their organization an entity of A.S., but failed to do so due to a lack of guidance from Senate, according to Nielson.</p>\n<p>With the help of Maalizadeh and Ochoa, the TSA was able to draft the proposal and complete the internal paperwork needed.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the things we want to do is just advocate for resources. With transfers, there’s no centralized voice,” Maalizadeh said. “There’s only so much a single person can do, but there’s so much that an organized group can do.”</p>\n<p>Maalizadeh envisions the TSA using its position in A.S. not just to hold community events, but also to advocate for resources such as more tutoring services and a better transfer student orientation.</p>\n<p>The TSA plans to work with the Transfer Student Center (TSC) by collaborating on events and utilizing the resources provided by the center.</p>\n<p>“Right now, I am a Transfer Peer Educator at the TSC, and I felt a division with the two even though we are serving the same constituents,” Ochoa said. “Now, I hope having a TSC liaison with the TSA will create more of a bond and collaborative efforts.”</p>\n<p>All four authors of the resolution emphasized that they hope to see transfer students having a larger presence on campus now that they have adequate representation in A.S.</p>\n<p>“Transfers come from everywhere, but we all have the same common identity of being a transfer,” Maalizadeh said. “I want to make sure that when people go to UCSB as a transfer, they aren’t an afterthought.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg.4 of the Feb. 15 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>According to the resolution, numerous students have been removed from housing due to their mental disabilities. The resolution reads that disability discrimination is “an issue that constantly looms over UCSB students” and calls for the alteration or removal of the “Personal Care” clause in the UCSB housing contract.</p>\n<p>The “Personal Care Clause,” located under the Personal Care section of the housing contract, states that “residents are responsible for their own self-care and personal needs.”</p>\n<p>“UCSB Residential and Community living claims to ‘value diversity and inclusivity,’ but actively removes/refuses students who are neuroatypical without alternative housing options, contributing to disability discrimination within housing, student housing insecurity, and poor mental health,” the resolution reads.</p>\n<p>The resolution was authored by Senator Alison Sir and Senator Anthony Pimentel and was developed and finalized on Jan. 23, according to Pimentel.</p>\n<p>“I felt a resolution was the most efficient solution to make a plan of action by creating a committee and working on this issue head on,” Sir said.</p>\n<p>She added that the students who brought the issue to her attention would like to remain anonymous due to the “extremity and sensitivity of this particular issue.”</p>\n<p>Pimentel said that the issue was first brought to Sir and she asked him to be the co-author. Students with a mental disability are part of a community that is oftentimes “overlooked,” Pimentel said.</p>\n<p>“When this type of mistreatment to a community occurs, I find it necessary and critical that, as a student leader, I do all that I can to hold the people responsible for their mistreatment to a community of students who need the most support,” he said.</p>\n<p>The resolution states that the “personal care” clause should be eliminated and a new clause dedicated to students with disabilities should be created.</p>\n<p>The Senate demands that UCSB Housing include a new clause dedicated to students with disabilities because “citing C.A.P.S. is not acceptable.”</p>\n<p>The UCSB Housing contract states that Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through 805-893-4411.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the contract states that C.A.P.S. offers a large range of services, including crisis intervention, individual and group counseling, psychological assessment, stress management and referrals to outside agencies.</p>\n<p>The Senate resolution, however, states that C.A.P.S. is prevented from “being an adequate source of relief for students with short- and long-term mental illnesses” because only a limited number of appointments can be provided for each student.</p>\n<p>The resolution adds that C.A.P.S. is “severely understaffed.”</p>\n<p>Sir said she and Pimentel are currently planning to have a meeting with C.A.P.S. to discuss the program and the concerns outlined in the resolution.</p>\n<p>The clause “provides much gray area for Housing and Residential Services to work with in illegally excluding mentally ill students from UCSB Housing,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>Currently, it is “considered reasonable” for UCSB Housing to remove or reject individuals who have a history of mental instability and who are not currently being treated to “mitigate the mental instability,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>On-campus housing is held to different standards than other landlord-tenant relationships as a government community-based housing entity.</p>\n<p>Pimentel and Sir will be holding a Housing Ad-Hoc Committee Feb. 2 in the Nati conference room from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. to discuss a plan combatting the Personal Care Clause, according to Pimentel.</p>\n<p>Interested students and the general public are invited to attend to share their own experiences or voice their opinions on this issue, Pimentel said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 1 of the Feb. 1 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
