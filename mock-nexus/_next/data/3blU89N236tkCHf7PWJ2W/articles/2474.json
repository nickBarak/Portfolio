The students were urged to click on a provided link, which would send them to a website where they could type their username and password to retrieve their email account.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scammers are reaching UCSB email accounts through “phishing,” a multi-billion-dollar underground illegal business in which scammers send forged emails to a pool of email users and wait for users to respond to the message. While Sanchez did not respond to the “phishing” bait, many students did, releasing their usernames and passwords and allowing their accounts to be used in other phishing attempts by scammers.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this month, a similar email was sent to UCSB staff, and 16 members released their login information to the dangerous site. These unsecure emails are not the first of their kind and pose a variety of threats to email users. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once scammers have a username and login, they could use it as a gateway to access other accounts or look into students’ academic and personal records.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Sam Horowitz, UCSB’s chief information security officer, phishing is “very common and fairly easy to do.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are bad guys in the world,” Horowitz said. “This is kind of the nature of what email and criminal … activity look like today.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phishing is common in many countries, including those formerly part of the Eastern Block and some unexpected countries such as Germany and the United States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of former Soviet countries are places we see hotbeds of activity,” said Joe McClain, the director of student systems I.T. infrastructure, security &amp; user support of UCSB’s Student Systems and Technology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Of course, China is on the list; there’s a lot of stuff happening in China, but there’re also countries you would never expect that would show up on the radar.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McClain said unsecure emails are becoming more “sophisticated” to look like emails sent from legitimate organizations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When spammers go phishing, they are throwing a lure out there to see how many people bite on it,” McClain said. The more refined the email, the more likely people will trust it and release personal information.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spammers are not only interested in accessing singular email addresses, but look for addresses that are trusted and widely used, like the umail server. The level of this spam only appears to be rising. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McClain said there are “hundreds of thousands” of spam emails sent to the university’s many departments daily. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s getting worse because it works … they can throw a message out there, and people click the link and give out their usernames and passwords,” McClain said. “If people didn’t do it, it wouldn’t be worthwhile.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university is always making improvements to the security systems in each department, but McClain notes in some cases it is easier to secure administration and business department emails on campus than academic departments.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The faculty typically wants things to be wide open, they want to be able to whatever they want to do … and the faculty have tremendous weight on campus,” McClain said. “So there are only so many things we can do to provide controls on systems used on the academic research side.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Horowitz sent an email to students Friday in response to the phishing attacks with suggestions about how to avoid getting trapped in a phishing attempt, such as being aware of who the email is coming from or what the email looks like.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also advised students to be “skeptical” of messages that seem “too good to be true, the consequences [are] too dire [or there’s a] sense of urgency.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, Sanchez and many other students refrained from giving their login information to the unsecure email sent last week. Horowitz said he hopes that with increased education about the danger of these phishing emails, fewer students and faculty will even consider opening the illicit messages.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an important thing, [and] it needs to be dealt with,” he said. “This stuff happens, and you need to protect yourself.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72015\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72015\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/","id":2472,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2471,2470,2469],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Danny DeVito To Promote Bernie Sanders Tuesday in The Arbor","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DEVITO-MARCH-ST.-LOUIS-THE-HILL.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DEVITO-MARCH-ST.-LOUIS-THE-HILL.jpg?resize=645%2C366&ssl=1","description":"Actor and director Danny DeVito will be at UC Santa Barbara on Tuesday afternoon, encouraging students to vote for Bernie Sanders in the California Democratic primary.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_71048\" style=\"width: 609px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71048\" data-attachment-id=\"71048\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-16/danny-devito-to-promote-bernie-sanders-tuesday-in-the-arbor/us-vote-democrats-politics/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DEVITO-MARCH-ST.-LOUIS-THE-HILL.jpg?fit=645%2C366&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"645,366\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bernie Sanders Danny Devito\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DEVITO-MARCH-ST.-LOUIS-THE-HILL.jpg?fit=250%2C142&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DEVITO-MARCH-ST.-LOUIS-THE-HILL.jpg?fit=645%2C366&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71048\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DEVITO-MARCH-ST.-LOUIS-THE-HILL.jpg?resize=599%2C340\" alt=\"Danny DeVito endorsed Bernie Sanders at a St. Louis rally in March.

She said she often found it difficult to focus on her schoolwork when she was so hungry that she felt nauseous.</p>\n<p>“One of my main concerns was worrying about not being able to focus on studying for an exam because I was hungry,” Nguyen said in an email. “It’s quite difficult to make the best out of your education when you’re focused on how you’re going to get access to your next meal [or] cook for your next meal.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen’s story is similar to the realities of many other UC students who find it hard to eat healthy and consistently with a college budget and rigorous student lifestyle.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The only way to reduce stigma around hunger is to start with your own personal narrative.”</p>\n<p>— Juli Nguyen</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to a spring 2015 survey from the UC, which was taken by 8,932 of 66,000 UC students, 42 percent of UC students struggled with poor quality food and insufficient sustenance in the past year.</p>\n<p>In response to the survey results, President Janet Napolitano announced Monday that she will allocate $3.3 million of the UC funds to help students struggling with food insecurity on behalf of the university’s Global Food Initiative. Each campus will receive $151,000 of the allocated amount.</p>\n<p>Among the focuses of the Global Food Initiative’s plan, the UC mentions the expansion of campus’ food pantry storage and access, an increase of student registration in CalFresh, the state’s nutrition assistance program and improved financial communication about the cost of food and living for students.</p>\n<p>Paul Monge, a UC Berkeley law student, UCSB alumnus and Student Regent designate, will work with Napolitano on projects to increase food security and said it is important for universities to receive more funding from the state rather than relying primarily on student tuition.</p>\n<p>“The university system is increasingly reliant on tuition and fees as their main source of revenue as opposed to state revenue,” Monge said. “The burden of paying for the universities … is placed on students and how that is translating is increase in prevalence of food insecurity.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61697\"

funding support the food bank’s expansion, adding that the current lack of funding is “keeping us from providing more for students that need it the most.”</p>\n<p>The survey also showed that 57 percent of students who now go hungry did not experience food problems during childhood, making this an even more “serious issue,” according to Katie Maynard, the UCSB Sustainability Coordinator.</p>\n<p>“Students may require additional information about crisis resources, financial aid, and making healthy choices on a limited budget” as they handle food inaccessibility for the first time, Maynard said in an email.</p>\n<p>Many students do not feel comfortable seeking assistance on the issue, however, causing them to “struggle in privacy,” Nguyen said.</p>\n<p>“I think what many of us don’t realize is that hunger can happen to anyone at any single time,” she said in an email. “If you go into I.V., it’s packed with people eating delicious food at a bunch of restaurants, but we don’t account for the percentage of students who are currently at home and hungry.”</p>\n<p>Maynard said UCSB’s Food Security Task Force will manage the $151,000 allocated to UCSB and plan to prioritize more options for low-income students, including the Certified Farmers’ Market and associated Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The way that we talk about affordability is often limited to fees and tuition, but I think we need to think about affordability in all aspects of a students’ life.”</p>\n<p>— Paul Monge</p></blockquote>\n<p>She also said the task force will hire eight students so they can analyze solutions offered at other campuses and expand existing programs.</p>\n<p>According to Monge, the cost of housing and food security is not typically associated with the affordability of college, which leads to a system wide lack of focus on students’ wellbeing.</p>\n<p>“The way that we talk about affordability is often limited to fees and tuition, but I think we need to think about affordability in all aspects of a students’ life,” Monge said. “We really need to reframe the narrative about what the university has responsibility over in terms of … students.”</p>\n<p>Despite being an upperclassman who uses the A.S. Food Bank, Nguyen finds herself struggling to make food a priority in her busy schedule.
