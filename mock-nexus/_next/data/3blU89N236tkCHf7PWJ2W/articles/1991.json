To open the month of October, it welcomed a band of 21 NBA players. The Memphis Grizzlies kicked off the 2015-2016 season holding their six-day training camp at Robertson Gymnasium in UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Hosting last year’s camp at RIMAC Arena in UC San Diego, it was only fitting that Head Coach Dave Joerger and his team headed west for another Cali training session, this time to the warm parts of Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>When asked why California is such an ideal place to train for the Grizzlies, 10-year veteran Beno Udrih said, “After a hard day of practice, it’s always nice to get outside and enjoy this quality weather. We had a really great experience down in San Diego [last year], and now we have another opportunity here in Santa Barbara.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Grizzlies’ preseason at UCSD appeared to pay off in league play as they finished the year racking up 55 wins and 27 losses, the second best record in franchise history. Memphis took second place in its Southwest Division as a result, solidifying a fifth-place seed in the Western Conference Playoffs.</p>\n<p>After a promising first round win over Portland in April, crushing the Trailblazers four games to one, Memphis fell short of its NBA Finals hopes, losing a 4-2 second round series to the reigning NBA champs, the Golden State Warriors.</p>\n<p>Last year wasn’t the first time the Grizzlies had a Finals appearance stolen from them. During its 2012-13 campaign, Memphis suffered a four-game sweep in the Conference Finals to the San Antonio Spurs. The Grizzlies arguably had their best season that year, putting up a franchise-record of 56-26 and having the Defensive Player of the Year in center Marc Gasol.</p>\n<p>Coach Joerger and his crew have had their chances but have not been able to capitalize. While a crucial facial fracture to team captain Mike Conley might have hindered the team’s quest for a ring last year, the Grizzlies leave this matter behind and continue to focus on one common goal: playing in June.<br>\nUdrih believes the key in getting over this tough playoff hump starts from within.</p>\n<p>“We need to keep believing we can do it,” Udrih said. “We hit a losing streak last year in March then [played] good basketball during the playoffs but got crossed with the best team in Golden State … if we trust in [ourselves] and work hard, anything is possible in this league.”</p>\n<p>After a couple pit stops around the NBA the two-time champion has made his home here in Memphis. Udrih had one of his best seasons last year adding point guard leadership behind Conley and offensive production for a young Grizzly second-string rotation. The vet from Slovenia finished second in bench, scoring averaging 7.7 points per game right behind mid-season acquisition and former Boston Celtic Jeff Green.</p>\n<p>While it has been an uphill battle for Udrih spending the majority of his years with Sacramento, he has no doubt that his time in Memphis will be a promising one.</p>\n<p>“I spent four years in Sacramento and they weren’t very good team-wise,” Udrih said. “I bounced around a little bit but now I’m here in Memphis and I feel appreciated for what my game is on and off the court. It’s great and hopefully I can finish my career here.”</p>\n<p>Along with Udrih and Green holding the front for the second team, the Grizzlies have added a nice mixture of youth and experience to their roster. Memphis signed rim protectors Brandan Wright and Ryan Hollins as well as combo-guard Matt Barnes this offseason. The three veterans will have a tremendous impact off the bench especially later on in the postseason.</p>\n<p>On top of this Memphis has seen good production from young guys like JaMychal Green, Russ Smith and Jordan Adams. All three were elite scorers for their respective college teams (Alabama, Lousville and UCLA) and can have breakout performances at any moment.</p>\n<p>With one of the best starting lineups in the league, a healthy Mike Conley back and a bolstered bench full of vets and youths, it seems like the Grizzlies are in good shape for a playoff run this year.

In an effort to rescue the region from its lead-contaminated water crisis, Ansah assembled a crew of teammates with one goal in mind: giving back. The Former BYU Cougar donated 94,000 bottles of water to his local community as an act of relief.</p>\n<p>A city where 40 percent of its inhabitants live in poverty, Flint has suffered the brute end of this water calamity following the city’s irrigation switch from Lake Huron in Detroit to the tainted Flint River. An ongoing epidemic since April of 2014, the citizens of Flint have voiced their frustrations to Governor Rich Snyder, yet limited progress has been made.</p>\n<p>As a result, Ansah took matters in to his own hands.</p>\n<p>The Ghana native opened up about his experiences living in the continent of Africa, empathizing with the citizens of Flint and their burdens of living under harmful irrigation conditions.</p>\n<p>“Coming from Africa, I know exactly what it means to not have clean water or to not have water at all,” Ansah stated per the Free Press. “For me to be in a position where me and my [teammates] can help out these fans down here is a great honor to us.”</p>\n<p>Fellow teammates Haloti Ngata, Darryl Tapp, Gabe Wright, Jason Jones, Joique Bell, and Tennessee Titan Angelo Blackson aided Ansah with their services stocking up cases of water and transporting them to the Flint Food Bank, Brennan Park Community Center, and other local recreation centers.</p>\n<p>With help from the Lions organization, 1,680 cases of water were safely distributed to areas affected by the water crisis, exceeding Ansah’s original goal.</p>\n<p>Among others who gave back was the defensive line of the Washington Redskins, contributing 3,600 Fiji water bottles in support of Ansah’s cause. Rapper and Detroit-native Big Sean also donated $10,000 in response to his #HEALFLINTKIDS campaign.</p>\n<p>As various other professional athletes and celebrities continue to donate water in support of minimizing the Flint water crisis, each contribution is a reminder of the platform that sports, music, and individuals of other professions possess in being able to have a universal influence that extends beyond the title of their career.</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_67654\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67654\" data-attachment-id=\"67654\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-26/helping-tackle-the-flint-water-crisis-detroit-lions-defensive-end-ziggy-ansah/ansah/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ansah.png?fit=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,450\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ansah\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ansah.png?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ansah.png?fit=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-67654\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ansah.png?resize=600%2C450\" alt=\"Ansah (red beanie) and his teammates.

Unfortunately, I’m the last person who follows it.</p>\n<p>If you read last week’s FSI article and paid close attention, you probably had a big week. As predicted, Mike Evans woke up from hibernation, Lamar Miller exploited Houston’s defense, and Todd Gurley made his case for ROY.

The once MVP caliber running back and the only Raider you can name from the past decade is back on the scene as a starting back, and guess what? He has the best line in the league, The Legion of Room, in front of him at all times and they helped him to 150 yards and a TD. With Randle on light carries for injury, McFadden got 29 carries. No, that isn’t a typo, the only mistake here is that he is only owned in half of leagues. He is a must have!

Usually a couple emerge during the season such as Gary Barnidge, who we’ll talk about shortly. Although he isn’t brand new, Reed is starting to make himself a big commodity as Kirk Cousin’s favorite target. In their recent come back victory over Tampa Bay, Reed was targeted 13 times and caught 11 of them for 72 yards and two TD’s, including the game winner. Now it’s doubtful that we will see many multi-touchdown games from him, or any Redskin for that matter, but his success in last week’s victory was even enough to get Kirk fired up!</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hqCfWzMOZpA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Nate Washington, WR Texans (5.9 percent)</em></p>\n<p>Now don’t expect this guy to get more targets than everyone’s favorite Hard Knocks actor, DeAndre Hopkins, who leads the league in looks, but Nate is surely spreading the wealth. He missed a couple games in the weeks prior due to injury but was back in action Sunday with 9 receptions and 127 yards. Oh yeah and he found the end zone twice! Maybe now that the entire league gets the fact that the Texans look for Hopkins as the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> option, Nate will be open a bit more. Ride this momentum until they figure him out too.</p>\n<p><em> </em><strong>Start’em, Sit’em</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong><em>Peyton Manning, QB Broncos (Sit)</em></p>\n<p>No, I am not scared that the Green Bay defense will pick him apart all night but they are not very giving to QB’s as far as fantasy goes this season. The main thing is that Peyton just hasn’t shown up when the lights are bright lately. This game against another undefeated team will not be about Peyton. Hopefully you have another QB of worth.</p>\n<p><em> </em><em>Rashad Jennings, RB Giants (Sit)</em></p>\n<p><em> </em>The backfield that this man now stands in is just too crowded for him to have real value except in very deep leagues. He may be a first possession back but he wont get many carries and it is doubtful that he will be called upon at the goal line, especially after coming off his worst game of the season. He was only given 5 carries and found 19 yards. It’s not good to average more yards per carry than you do total carries, unless you score every time you touch the ball. Jennings has found the end zone once this season on the ground.</p>\n<p><em> </em><em>Gary Barnidge, TE Browns (Start)</em></p>\n<p>Told you we would get to this guy. Over the past five games, Barnidge has averaged over 15 points in standard leagues and continues to make miraculous plays. He reached over the 100-yard mark for the third time this season this past Sunday and was a great option despite ending his TD streak of four straight games. I know that Arizona has a great defense but this guy seems unstoppable right now and the Browns WILL throw the ball his way.</p>\n<p><em> </em><em>Michael Crabtree, WR Raiders (Start)</em></p>\n<p><em> </em>This man was featured just weeks ago in our “Hot Off the Wire” list and now has found himself to be owned in well over half of leagues. Most people can’t see his value since he is playing with Carr’s new favorite target, rookie Amari Cooper, but just based off of targets Crabtree seems to be his favorite. He leads the team with 56 targets on the year so far which is almost 10 a game. On top of that, he’s been efficient with these opportunities with 4 receptions as his season low. This week the Raiders play a tough secondary in the Jets but it is very likely that Cooper will be on Revis  Island, leaving Crabtree to roam freely.</p>\n<p><em> </em><em>Phillip Rivers, QB Chargers (Start)</em></p>\n<p>Okay this is an obvious one here and I shouldn’t have to tell the owners of Rivers to start their No. 1 QB, but this year’s draft really disrespected the league’s leader in passing yards. Over the last four games he has averaged nearly 400 yards at 390.5 and has 10 TD’s in that time. I’m no mathematician but that is a ton of fantasy points and more importantly, it’s consistency! Rivers remains one of the best QB’s in this league, both in the real league and fantasy. Watch him go for another big day over a struggling Ravens defense.</p>\n<p><em>Matthew Stafford, QB Lions (Start)</em></p>\n<p>Okay, I did get one wrong last week in telling you all to sit Stafford. Honestly, it was just to keep up my streak of hatred, but now I am here to reconcile that by telling you to start him. Last week was just his 2<sup>nd</sup> game of the season where he didn’t turn the ball over. Good sign. I just like his matchup this week against a faltering secondary in Kansa City. I expect another 250 and two TD’s.</p>\n<p><em>Derek Carr, QB Raiders (Sit)</em></p>\n<p>I’ve loved this guy since he got drafted, but every QB is going to have a bad matchup some weeks. This is contradictory to my advice on Crabtree, but with the pass defense the Jets have, Carr will definitely get the bad side of it while Crabtree will prosper from the attention shift. I’m not saying Carr is going to be torn limb from limb, but he will definitely be safer on your bench this week. I really hope he proves me wrong.</p>\n<p>Thank you all again for joining me this week on Fantasy Sports Island, I hope this advice leads you well. As always, feel free to contact me on twitter (Even if you slide in my DM’s) with any questions or concerns that you may have. Good luck this week!</p>\n<p>@TheRealMoebus</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65894\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/fantasy-sports-island-nfl-week-8/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65894\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/fantasy-sports-island-nfl-week-8/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/fantasy-sports-island-nfl-week-8/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/fantasy-sports-island-nfl-week-8/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/fantasy-sports-island-nfl-week-8/","id":1989,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[1988,1987,1986],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
