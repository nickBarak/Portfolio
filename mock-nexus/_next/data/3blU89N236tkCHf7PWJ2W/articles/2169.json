We make mistakes and we own up to them. We issue corrections when needed and we are open, time and time again, as to how our reporting process works.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> has a duty to the student body to keep them informed of relevant issues in their community. We also do our best as student journalists to hold elected officials accountable.</p>\n<p>We feel the need to write this editorial because the Associated Students (A.S.) 69th Senate is not doing that for themselves.</p>\n<p>The Senate has a duty to the student body to represent students’ issues, one they have not maintained since taking office.</p>\n<p>In the <em>Nexus’</em> point of view – as individuals who extensively cover Senate’s resolutions, meetings and more – the 69th Senate consistently fails to represent our student body and is, in no way, accountable to the people they were elected to serve.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate is a group of 24 students who decide how millions of dollars of our student fees are spent. The senators are paid $350 a quarter in honorarium and are required to fulfill specific duties, such as holding office hours.</p>\n<p>However, A.S. Senate as a whole lacks transparency. Below are a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Senate did not have a public list of their office hours until the <em>Nexus</em> requested it during Week 6. The 2018-2019 A.S. Legal Code mandates this list be “scheduled and publicly posted by the end of the third (3rd) week of each quarter.”</li>\n<li>They use Facebook to communicate Senate-related announcements to their constituents, despite the fact that you need to have a Facebook account and be Facebook friends with them to see anything remotely related to their positions.</li>\n<li>They did not establish a Senate bill database until after the <em>Nexus</em> created one last year in order to make every resolution easily accessible to the senators’ constituents.</li>\n<li>They demanded The Bottom Line (TBL) turn off a livestream at the end of a public Senate meeting, which TBL – and the <em>Nexus</em> – had every right to record.</li>\n<li>Their website is still not updated with the names and office hours of this year’s senators, even though it is the end of Week 7.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Senators are not holding themselves accountable; instead, they consistently act unprofessionally as elected officials who control millions of dollars in student fees.</p>\n<p>We do want to acknowledge the valuable work some senators have been doing. For example, Senator Zion Solomon has worked to compile finance reports that detail the amount of money allocated to organizations during Finance and Business Committee meetings.</p>\n<p>To our knowledge, the finance reports are only posted on Facebook, but Senator Solomon’s efforts show a commitment to transparency.</p>\n<p>Senators do good things. We’re not saying they don’t. However, many of them have not been doing the jobs they have been elected to do.</p>\n<p>Even the leader of Senate – Internal Vice President (IVP) Steven Ho, whose pay amounts to $3,000 a quarter – fails to take his job seriously.</p>\n<p>His job is to hold his senators accountable, to keep some semblance of decorum during Senate meetings and to ensure senators follow Legal Code.</p>\n<p>Despite this, Ho fails to show professionalism, even during Senate meetings. Ho, as the IVP, sets the tone for how senators should conduct themselves during meetings.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday’s Senate meeting, Ho <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/46381421_335573963663022_3500040927651561472_n.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1279546202\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"84956\">retweeted</a> a tweet from Senate minute-taker Isabella Liu, which stated “someone get me out of this meeting please.” Ho replied to the tweet at 7:26 p.m. with “someone save us please.”</p>\n<p>Later during that same meeting, Ho <a href=\"http://46498938_2203294369732002_1446147155357073408_n.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1131452933\" data-slb-group=\"84956\">tweeted</a> “this meeting has been going on in circles, I wish I could get a proxy.”</p>\n<p>Both Twitter accounts are public.</p>\n<p>What senators – and Ho – seem to forget is that representing our student body is a privilege, one that they have been given by the students.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday’s Senate meeting, a UCSB alumnus stood up at public forum, identifying themselves as a “concerned Gaucho.”</p>\n<p>“I’m here to tell you one simple sentence, and I’m not taking any questions, but I recently realized that the <em>Daily Nexus</em> is really good for toilet paper and I want to recommend it to all of you. It’s really good to wipe your ass with,” the individual said.</p>\n<p>“It’s really just trash, garbage newspaper so please use it to wipe your butthole with whenever you’re taking a shit, that’s my recommendation.”</p>\n<p>His words are what spurred this editorial, but they are not the focus of it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">What senators – and Ho – seem to forget is that representing our student body is a privilege, one that they have been given by the students.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Instead, we would like to call attention to the way the senators and proxies, as well as Ho, responded to this individual.</p>\n<p>In response to this individual’s words, senators and proxies laughed and clapped their hands over their mouths. One even bowed toward the podium as the individual walked away.</p>\n<p>Ho could be seen recording the individual and laughing. The video <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9540.TRIM_.mov\">was posted</a> on Ho’s Snapchat story with the caption “I have no words 4 dis.”</p>\n<p>The comments from “concerned Gaucho” were not said in order to provide constructive dialogue or a call to action. Rather, they were blatantly inflammatory and used to reap attention.</p>\n<p>A few members of A.S. spoke with the <em>Nexus</em> following these remarks, condemning the sentiments. Yet no one publicly addressed the individual’s comments for the rest of the meeting.</p>\n<p>Senators are not required to defend the <em>Nexus</em>, but there are standards they must adhere to.</p>\n<p>According to their own 2018-2019 A.S. Legal Code, members of A.S. must “treat each other and those in the community with behavior that fosters a safe, inclusive environment for everyone. This behavior includes but is not limited to: professionalism, compassion, courtesy, civility, and respect.”</p>\n<p>We would have hoped senators would have acted in accordance to their Legal Code, as their response to “concerned Gaucho”’s remarks was not professional, compassionate, courteous, civil or respectful.</p>\n<p>Instead, our paid, elected officials laughed at the hateful comments.</p>\n<p>They did not keep composure – they joined in on the joke.</p>\n<p>This is a student government, and we are a student newspaper. To the world outside our university, it is easy to dismiss our student government’s actions as an inconsequential side effect of decisions made by 18 to 22-year-olds.</p>\n<p>However, these people are our future “real-world” leaders. From what we have observed so far, there is a dangerous precedent in motion.</p>\n<p>Maybe we’re asking for too much.

My inner surf bum is an anxious and neurotic man who wants to have a job that one day provides him with the cash to travel the world for surf and buy his future children wetsuits to start their stoke. For now, I have to do something to stave off the surf withdrawals. My answer is surf porn.</p>\n<p>There’s a range of paraphernalia you can access by passing grubby Surfer magazines between roommates, perusing a pristine copy of The Surfer’s Journal at shops on the sly, or by downloading some good ol’ fashioned Surfline content. Perhaps you can catch a little voyeur action from a beach or balcony.</p>\n<p>Surf porn, though, is not the real thing.</p>\n<p>Still, your best way to experience the thrill of the paddle-out, the rush of the drop and the calmness of the tube is to indulge your imagination. Saturate your brain with salty spray and howling off-shores.</p>\n<p>Take a moment before you sleep and picture yourself climbing down a frigid rocky trail with a board under one arm, leash slung across a shoulder with your neoprene zipped tight all the way to the neck. Or picture a slabby day at Teahupoo in board shorts, a week of cobblestone point break perfection in Central America, an empty head-high set at Trestles or a two-foot wave at Devereaux, for example.</p>\n<p>At the moment, the surf flick playing in my head stars yours truly, cutting through a heavy Northern California paddle-out with ease, and charging massive hollow beach breaks, getting shack after shack after shack, barrels for miles just frothing out of my head, etc. You can see how it goes in my future — perhaps fictional — surf world.</p>\n<p>But maybe when you imagine it, your board is a towel next to a pool/hot tub combo overlooking a beach where drinks are catered along with vegetables and fruits and glitter and who knows what else.</p>\n<p>The point I am getting to here is that hope floats. The exact substance of your surf dreams doesn’t matter as much as the desire that propels your mental strokes.</p>\n<p>Don’t let the ripples in your brain become a placid lake. Stir things up. Send yourself some south swells to take away the dreariness of a foggy day in the library. Maybe one day that wish can be reality. And when it happens, the sensation won’t resemble the peeling apart of two pages of a surf magazine that have become stuck together … with wax.</p>\n<p>The pages of Daily Nexus surf columnist Elliott Rosenfeld’s mind have become stuck together too, but not with wax.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>The AFC Championship will be host to a variety of subplots featuring Rex Ryan and his flavor of the week, as well as the brutish Steelers defense versus the slick Jets defense. But above every subplot is the main storyline: the battle between Aaron Rodgers and Marky Mark Sanchez.</p>\n<p>Their season statistics couldn’t be more different, with Rodgers at the top of the QB class in almost every category and Sanchez with 11 fewer touchdowns, 700 fewer yards and a 25-point lower rating. The USC-bred, heavily recruited golden boy from Mission Viejo versus Chico-native Rodgers, who is the equivalent of Ryan on the “The O.C.” — a hard-luck kid who, with the help of some people, found justice, peace and success. Seemingly an easy pick, intangibles will weigh in heavily here.</p>\n<p>The NFC is pretty similar to the other quarterback matchup, with one quite a bit more talented, not to mention more experienced, than the other. In one corner, weighing in at a hulking 242 pounds, is Big Ben Roethlisberger, a behemoth man who can shake tackles like he is swatting away a gnat. His season statistics rank atop the QB heap, throwing for 3,200 yards while giving up only five interceptions. In the other corner: “Mr. Friendly,” Jay Cutler, who alternates between gun-slinging genius and interception-prone hack. Roethlisberger’s the better QB so there may be a clear-cut favorite, but football is a game of luck and chance. Come Jan. 23, it’s anybody’s game.</p>\n<p>A lot more than simply stats and rankings goes into the decision of who gets the final rose. A quarterback needs a certain presence; a command over his teammates that goes unquestioned. The rose-winning factors are the ways in which the QB in question inspires his team, not his statistics.</p>\n<p>I pick Big Ben over JC in the NFC and Rodgers over Marky Mark in the AFC. Cutler is a whiner who does not seem to have the control over his team that Rodgers does. You get the idea that his teammates listen to Jay in spite of who he is. With Aaron, they respect him for everything that Jay isn’t.</p>\n<p>In the AFC matchup, Sanchez is not the leader of his team, Rex is. Sorry, but Rex isn’t in the huddle. The Jets are going to need a calm presence, and Sanchez won’t be able to deliver. Ben has been there before and has the poise to steer his team to a win.</p>\n<p>For the final rose? The Super Bowl rose? I’m going with Rodgers. Simply put, his genes look better than Big Ben’s.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-31942\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-19/speaces-pieces-nfl-playoff-rose/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-31942\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-19/speaces-pieces-nfl-playoff-rose/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-19/speaces-pieces-nfl-playoff-rose/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-19/speaces-pieces-nfl-playoff-rose/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-19/speaces-pieces-nfl-playoff-rose/","id":2166,"author":{"id":95,"name":"Julia Speace"},"related":[2165,2164,2163],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
