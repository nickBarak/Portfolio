met a barber who actually trained me,” he said. “I went to the shop every day from like nine to six over the summer and I just watched them cut hair.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The bond between a man and

Nazari was known as the “Roofless Barber” in high school because he used to cut hair outside, and the name now appears on his business cards.</p>\n<p>“My principal caught me once and was like, ‘You can’t be doing this,’ and I still kept doing it,” he said. “And the janitors knew me, they would leave a broom out for me.”</p>\n<p>At UCSB, Nazari first started cutting hair after an icebreaker.</p>\n<p>“I said, ‘Hi, I’m Gilbert, and I cut hair,’ and I ended up running out of 250 cards. And it’s only been two months,” Nazari said.</p>\n<p>In his time at UCSB, Nazari has worked with approximately 40 clients. At a price tag of $13, his haircuts are cheaper than most nearby hair salons.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73667\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1239892528\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73658\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73667\" data-attachment-id=\"73667\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/uc-santa-barber-first-year-student-runs-authentic-salon-out-of-anacapa/30512299552_313359464e_o/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?fit=5184%2C3456&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"5184,3456\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"30512299552_313359464e_o\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73667\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"Nazari apprenticed for two years, and hopes to give each of his clients a professional barbering experience. \" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?w=5184&amp;ssl=1 5184w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73667\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nazari brought all his barbering tools from home, and is allowed to operate in the dorms as long as he cleans up after each appointment. <em>Courtesy Nathan Mai</em></p></div>\n<p>He has already established several regulars; one customer has returned three times in the two months that he’s been here.</p>\n<p>“$13 and he’ll spend over 30 minutes cutting your hair,” said Vijay Parameswaran, first-year economics major who was particularly shaggy prior to his haircut. “Great customer service and he’s really easy to talk to.

Marine Science Institute and the World Economic Forum partnering to bring marine health science to the international stage.</p>\n<p>The World Economic Forum (WEF) is an international organization that focuses on global issues such as water, clean energy and global health. This year, the organization is encouraging political and business global leaders to connect with scientists and brainstorm how to improve ocean health.</p>\n<p>The Marine Science Institute (MSI) was selected to provide a scientific component to the global dialogue about ocean health. The Benioff Ocean Initiative, a program within MSI, will work directly with the WEF to present an ocean health plan at the United Nations Ocean Conference in June.</p>\n<p>“With a campus surrounded by the ocean on three sides, the health of our marine environments is something that is very personal for UCSB,” Pierre Wiltzius, the Susan &amp; Bruce Worster dean of science and executive dean of the College of Letters and Science, said in an email.</p>\n<p>“We also have a reputation as one of the leading institutions for marine research, and we are very proud to continue to foster an interdisciplinary environment that encourages collaboration around vital issues like ocean health,” he said.</p>\n<p>Douglas McCauley, the director of the Benioff Ocean Initiative and an assistant professor in the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology, said the WEF is hoping to increase ocean research and health. He said UCSB will be their “guide from the science community.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not just about whales anymore,” McCauley said, emphasizing the ocean’s modern role in economic, social and political issues.</p>\n<p>Wiltzius emphasized the importance of a dialogue between scientists and global leaders to preserve the marine environments for the future and said he believes the MSI’s leading research will help the “crusade to save our oceans.”</p>\n<p>“I believe that this will elevate the conversation about ocean health to a global level, which is crucial, because oceans affect the entire planet on a global scale,” Wiltzius said in an email. “We need the support of world leaders as we translate our marine science research into action.”</p>\n<p>McCauley recently went to the WEF meeting in Davos, Switzerland, where he presented marine life extinction rates and the importance of improving the state of the ocean. According to McCauley, the WEF was receptive to his information and he is “optimistic” about the ocean’s future.</p>\n<p>“It’s really exciting to see a room full of people that really care and want to learn,” he said. “I think in the science community, people have done a really good job translating what is happening in the oceans into currencies that help global leaders understand that it matters.”</p>\n<p>The ocean’s economic value is $24 trillion, making its wellbeing more than an environmental issue — it’s a global commodity. Additionally, overfishing is a crucial problem affecting the oceans and can have current and future impacts on nutrition and food insecurity, as well as increase international conflicts over fish.</p>\n<p>McCauley said the MSI and WEF will focus their efforts on decreasing overfishing, particularly in the harvesting of tuna fish, and present their plan to the United Nations Ocean Conference this summer.</p>\n<p>“Historically, we thought that oceans couldn’t be overfished … but we figured out we were wrong,” McCauley said. “About one-third of all our global fish docks are overfished.”</p>\n<p>The plan will include combining transparency with sustainability, as well as offering ways to make sustainability more affordable. Some retailers are unwilling to change their consumer habits toward an environmental approach because of the expense of sustainable fishing.</p>\n<p>However, McCauley said many retailers are already joining the environmental effort and he hopes more will join the dialogue by the June meeting in New York.</p>\n<p>The WEF and the United Nations Oceans Conference will be making large steps in their address of global environmental concerns. McCauley expressed worry about the Trump administration’s quiet stance on ocean health, but he said the MSI and WEF’s partnership will allow for global leaders and scientists to address the environment as something more than a national topic.</p>\n<p>“The nice thing about the ocean is that [it] is truly a global commodity, and the future can be decided as an international conversation,” McCauley said.</p>\n<p>McCauley said he is hopeful the MSI and WEF partnership will be able to begin dedicated work for global oceans and make a lasting difference for future generations.</p>\n<p>“We view it as a legacy thing. I have kids, and I have to learn how to pass the ocean in a slightly better state to [them],” he said. “In many ways, this is a great time because everyone in the international community is realizing we need to work together.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75241\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/msi-wef-address-ocean-health-at-sb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75241\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/msi-wef-address-ocean-health-at-sb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/msi-wef-address-ocean-health-at-sb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/msi-wef-address-ocean-health-at-sb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/msi-wef-address-ocean-health-at-sb/","id":2714,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2713,2712,2711],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Legal Code.</p>\n<p>The bill proposed that all gender binary pronouns (he/him/his, she/her/hers) and accompanying grammar be altered for gender-neutral pronouns (they/them/theirs).</p>\n<p>Senator Elias Jordan got the idea for the bill during a training session when Christine Dolan, associate director of the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), spoke about the importance of society becoming more gender inclusive.</p>\n<p>“We know that LGBTQ people are everywhere, at every intersection of identities, and we know that all oppression is connected,” Dolan says in her Student Affairs biography. “Our liberation is collective, and until we can join in solidarity to challenge racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic and other systems of oppression, we cannot be free.”</p>\n<p>The bill gained student interest after the Senate’s retreat, prompting Jordan to get it passed quickly. He worked at his high school’s resource and counseling center to become more informed on topics of gender diversity and sexuality.</p>\n<p>“I thought this could be a big step forward on a larger scale, considering how prestigious UCSB is,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>The legislation, which was the first piece proposed by the Senate member, was slowed down because of minor writing issues. It experienced no opposition in Senate.</p>\n<p>Changing an official document to accommodate every person, Jordan said, validates people on campus who don’t feel as if they have a voice.</p>\n<p>UCSB took another step toward inclusivity this summer when the Office of Registrar worked with the RCSGD to update the school’s system so that ACCESS cards, class rosters and faculty interactions with students would change according to the student’s preferred name.</p>\n<p>Pronouns haven’t been altered in the system, but students who identify with a different first name can use it without having to change any legal documents.</p>\n<p>Jordan said he hopes the legislation can prompt both individuals, as well as other institutions, to think about the acceptance of others and the role we as individuals play in that.</p>\n<p>“Depending on how far it could spread, I think we can help people think about the diversity that we have as something to celebrate and not sweep under the rug,” he said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, November 3, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div
