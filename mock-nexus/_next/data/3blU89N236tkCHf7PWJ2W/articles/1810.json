In the position, she is responsible for sending out weekly agendas, leading meetings when the IVP isn’t present and meeting with A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m knowledgeable about how exactly to create an agenda, what goes onto the agenda, how to effectively create it and run the Senate meeting,” White said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve seen what goes into [being] Internal Vice President and I know what I can do to make it better, to make senators’ Senate time and Senate meetings more effective.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White’s ideas aren’t groundbreaking, but the Nexus chose her because we believe she is the most qualified of the two candidates — based on Senate experience — and is the only candidate with the firm ability to effectively lead weekly Senate meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White’s opponent, fourth-year feminist studies major and current A.S. Senator Racquel Almario, brings extensive experience to the position as the current Finance and Business Committee chair, controlling the Senate’s budget and allotting funds to organizations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almario has done a substantial amount of work over the year during their senate term as Finance and Business chair, and they are always prepared to explain any budgetary requests to fellow senators when called upon. However, in their interview, Almario failed to elaborate on the details of their plans for the position of IVP and how they intended to execute them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Almario lacked enthusiasm and strong public speaking skills, which we believe are essential to chairing Senate meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A concern of the Nexus</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">prior to our endorsement interview was that White would only continue the work started by Adam because of their close working relationship. But White wasn’t afraid to be critical of the ways that Adam didn’t fully measure up. </span></p>\n<p>White pointed out that one problem of Adam’s 70th Senate was poorly attended senator trainings.</p>\n<p>“In the beginning of the year there were supposed to trainings that senators were supposed to complete. I believe we’re supposed to complete seven out of the 14 trainings and a lot of them just did not get done. We had a lot of issues with getting senators to go to the trainings,” White said.</p>\n<p>White said that these required trainings were “not consolidated and it was not as organized as it could be” this past year. She plans to implement a system to begin senators’ trainings during the Declaration of Candidacy (D.O.C.) period of elections instead of after senators are sworn into office.</p>\n<p>“It’s having senators knowledgeable and ready to work from day one, from D.O.C., so that when they do get elected, they can just start doing what they want to do from the moment they win that position, from the moment they’re sworn in, instead of having to wait and having all these confusing trainings in the middle of the fall that people ultimately didn’t end up attending.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This change wouldn’t go into effect until the 72nd Senate, as the D.O.C. period is prior to the election, but White said she plans to hold trainings as soon as new senators are elected, so that the 71st Senate can hit the ground running in the fall when students will be back on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate as a whole has often faced problems of transparency, with many students unaware of what senators do on a weekly basis and how the Senate can benefit them, despite the fact that it controls close to $15 million in student fees. Different IVPs have introduced initiatives year-to-year to address the lack of overall visibility, with varying success, and their ability to implement these plans plays a role in their overall success as IVP.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White said that, if elected, she would publish weekly informational graphics on social media, listing which resolutions will be discussed that week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another key plan of White’s is using the Senate unallocated budget, a portion of the Senate’s funds reserved for organizations needing extra funding, to create an emergency fund for students navigating financial burdens due to the coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These funds could be used by students to pay rent, break leases or rent storage units, and after the fund’s coronavirus-related needs are over, it would be converted into an A.S. emergency fund, to be used in times of crisis that affect the entire campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this plan, White intends to reach out to the UCSB Alumni Association to create an endowment and also wants to connect with potential donors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White did not fully answer how her plan is different from the work already being done by the Financial Crisis Response Team (FCRT), which is designed to help students financially in situations like the coronavirus or the 2017 Thomas Fire. When asked to clarify, she said she believes the organization’s work is only on an individual basis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a red flag that White lacked a deep understanding about the FCRT, which would be crucial to implementing what is her top platform point. But the IVP, more so than any other executive position, is more focused on internal operations than directly impacting students through new initiatives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both White and Almario were senators this year, each with leading roles within the senate, as first pro-tempore and Finance and Business Committee chair, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the term, Almario authored four resolutions, compared to White’s 17. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, this was a decision not made lightly by the Nexus, as Almario brings extensive A.S. experience and some great platform points to the table. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almario said that, if elected, they plan to move required trainings online, helping to ensure that all senators are trained while not requiring scheduled appointments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almario also wants to create a senate bill tracker, which is far more comprehensive in ensuring accountability compared to White’s weekly update plan. We would hope that White would implement some of these initiatives if elected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, the Nexus believes that White has the ability to lead a unified Senate, not two separate parties refusing to work across the aisle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White is not a perfect candidate, but Almario’s interview made clear that they did not have the same ability to control the Senate room, which, in the end, is paramount to the success of the IVP. The IVP needs to be a force of leadership, someone who is not afraid to stand up and keep people in line. With this crucial requirement in mind, the Nexus</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">believes that White is the best fit for the job. </span></p>\n<p><em>[Update 10:16 p.m.]: This article has been updated to better reflect White’s critiques of Adam. </em></p>\n<p><em>[Update] The Nexus has replaced the portraits done of each candidate with their self-submitted headshot.

At the Folino Invitational, Smith was bested by Long Beach State’s Joe Fryer, putting him in second place; however, the former 2014 Big West Freshman of the Year played a solid outing finishing 2-under par 214.</p>\n<p>“Outstanding tournament, a hard course and finishing two under par is outstanding. But he hit a quadruple-bogey on the 12th hole and missed his opportunity to win the individual,” Head Coach Steve Lass said.</p>\n<p>At the Farms Golf Club, UCSB will expect to play Smith, freshman Brett Bennett, junior Brandon Bauman, junior Willy Moffly and sophomore Tyler See. Bennett, Bauman and Moffly all finished in the top 10 individually, with Bennett finishing the highest tied for seventh.</p>\n<p>Monday’s invitational will be no joke, as the Farms Golf Club located in Rancho Santa Fe is one of the hardest courses to play on. The course begins with easy holes; however, the difficulty definitely varies as players go on. It spans 7211 yards and has a total par of 72.</p>\n<p>“This will be the most difficult course we will play in all year,” Lass said. “But it can definitely help us grow, and I think we will play well.”</p>\n<p>Notching a second-place finish in its first tournament of the new year was definitely a nice way to start 2017, but Coach Lass knows this team still has its kinks to work out if it wants to take home the Big West championship this year.</p>\n<p>“We are one of the top teams in the Big West. On any given day we are as good as anyone and I like our chances, but we do have to minimize our mistakes,” Lass said.</p>\n<p>UCSB golf begins the Pro Compression/Folino Invitational at 8 a.m. on Monday, Feb. 13, at the Farms Golf Club.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

Scher finished the tournament in a three-way tie for eighth place by shooting 5-over par 221, making it the seventh-straight time he has finished in the top 10.</p>\n<p>With a score of 305 in the first day of the competition, the Gauchos at that point were tied with UC Irvine for ninth overall and 13 shots off first place, a deficit that would prove to be too much to overcome by the third day of the tournament.</p>\n<p>“Our hopes of winning the tournament kind of got really squashed because of our terrible opening round,” Ley said.</p>\n<p>Senior Jordan Epstein finished 5-over par and fellow senior Marshall Colby was one shot behind Epstein to conclude the first round. Epstein and Colby ended the tournament in 17th and 41st place, respectively.</p>\n<p>Another notable performance by the Gauchos was delivered by sophomore Amol Mahal who placed 36th overall by shooting 17-over par 233.</p>\n<p>The tournament marks the final competition for the Gauchos this season as they look to build on what they accomplished this year going forward. With only two seniors on the current roster, the team will rely on its core group of returning players for next season.</p>\n<p>“Building on what we did in those last two rounds I think is really going to be one of our goals going into next year,” Ley said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 2nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Photo Courtesy of Tony Mastres</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51147\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/gauchos-take-fourth-at-conference-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51147\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/gauchos-take-fourth-at-conference-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/gauchos-take-fourth-at-conference-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/gauchos-take-fourth-at-conference-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/gauchos-take-fourth-at-conference-championship/","id":1807,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1806,1805,1804],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Ends Historic Season With 11th-Place Finish at NCAA Regional","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Golf","publish_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Golf_BigWest-JorgeMercado-170517-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Golf_BigWest-JorgeMercado-170517-03-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After five tournament titles, including a Big West championship, an NCAA Regional appearance and a whole lot of individual accolades, the 2016-17 UCSB golf team finally ends its historic season with a...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Despite winning a conference championship this year, the UCSB golf team knew the postseason would be much more difficult.

As a whole, the team finished with a total 34-over par 874, finishing in front of Sacramento State’s 48-over par 888 and South Dakota State’s 59-over par 899.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Only four teams finished the tournament carding under par, with the winner of the Regional going to the host, Stanford, who tied for first with Baylor as they both carded 17-under 823. They will be advancing to the NCAA championship, along with third-place Pepperdine, fourth-place Oklahoma and fifth-place North Carolina, in hopes of attaining a national title.</p>\n<p>Individually, freshman Brett Bennett and junior Zach Smith each shot a 1-over par 71 in the final round to lead UCSB, while sophomore Nick Swanson finished with a 2-over par 72.</p>\n<p>Swanson and Bennett both were the highest-ranking Gauchos in the tournament, finishing 5-over 215 to tie for 33rd place out of the 75 competing athletes. Smith registered a 9-over par 219 to finish tied for 54th place. Junior Brandon Bauman finished tied for 65th with a 16-over par performance while junior Willy Moffly finished tied for 68th at 17-over par.</p>\n<p>The highest finish for an athlete from the Big West was UC Irvine’s David Kim, who finished the tournament tied for 20th place at 2-over par 212. Big West individual champion junior Felix Mory from Cal State Northridge also participated in the regional, finishing tied for 23rd after carding 3-over par 213.</p>\n<p>The winner of the Stanford Regional went to Oklahoma’s sophomore Brad Dalke, who carded a 12-under par 198 to take home first-place honors. Baylor’s freshman Cooper Dossey finished the competition at second place with a 9-under par performance, while Stanford’s senior Maverick McNealy shot at 8-under par to round out the top three.</p>\n<p>Despite the 11th-place finish, the Gauchos capped off one of the best seasons in UCSB history with all the tournament titles and individual accolades. However, the best part is probably the fact that they will return most of this starting team, and with young guys like Swanson and Bennett performing at a high level, the sky is the ceiling for next year’s team.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
