Attorney General, said in the meeting minutes.</p>\n<p>The External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) position was left vacant after the disqualification of EVPSA-elect Mayela Morales last spring.</p>\n<p>At the Oct. 25 meeting, Madeline Loudon, the sole candidate for the EVPSA position, argued that the threshold was unlikely to be met.</p>\n<p>Loudon was the runner-up in the Spring 2018 Election.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been campaigning on this campus for three years now and I know the feasibility of trying to get students to turnout and I know how apathetic students can be. I believe that we are not going to hit the threshold by the second date for sure,” Loudon said.</p>\n<p>In the meeting minutes, Elections Board Member Andrew Yan noted that the office would still be able to function without the External Vice President For Statewide Affairs (EVPSA).</p>\n<p>“There are mechanisms that allow the EVPSA office to continue if that position remains vacant,” Diana Collins Puente, Elections Board advisor, said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate passed a resolution over the summer to allow the duties and funds of the office to be split, stating that a bulk of the position’s duties began over the summer as opposed to Fall Quarter.</p>\n<p>At the Oct. 24 Senate meeting, Alexandra Gessesse, who has been fulfilling some of the duties of the EVPSA in her position as campaign organizing director, urged the Senate to encourage their constituents to vote.</p>\n<p>“We still haven’t met the threshold, and our office is starting to [get] our nose deep in work regarding requisition forms and things like that,” she said. “We don’t have an EVPSA, and we won’t have one for the entire year, and that’ll be really hard for our office.”</p>\n<p>“Campaign as if you were campaigning for yourself.”</p>\n<p>While Elections Board decided against halving the threshold for the time being, they are putting their efforts toward their “Get Out The Vote” campaign by setting up a voting booth at Pardall Center and a mobile voting booth on campus.</p>\n<p>They also partnered with the A.S. Ticket Office to send an email to students who purchased tickets to the annual Delirium concert put on by A.S. Program Board.</p>\n<p>Loudon did not appear to be actively campaigning by the time Elections Board held their Oct. 11 meeting and was unable to make it to the candidate forum on Oct. 5.</p>\n<p>If the minimum voting threshold is not reached, the EVPSA position will remain vacant until the Spring Quarter 2019 elections.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Nov. 3]: This article was updated to include information about the second extension of the deadline. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-84667\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sweet said he has been barred from entering campus. <em>Courtesy of UCSB Faculty Page</em></p></div>\n<p>Sweet’s leave of absence comes after a junior faculty member and an undergraduate summer trainee filed a complaint against him regarding an interaction in July of this year.</p>\n<p>Sweet detailed the interaction and his difficulties dealing with the UCSB administration in a Facebook post on Oct. 13.</p>\n<p>“A junior faculty member got a key to my locked graduate student office room and put one of his off-campus undergraduate summer trainees at the desk of one of my graduate students, displacing her private materials,” Sweet said in the Facebook post.</p>\n<p>Noticing the unlocked office, Sweet requested the undergraduate trainee leave the graduate student’s office.</p>\n<p>“I informed [the junior faculty member] of department policy on secure offices for grad students, and copied my department chair, late afternoon,” Sweet said. “She replied that she’d sort it out, and next morning sent an email telling [the junior faculty member] he was out of line, and that I had responded appropriately.”</p>\n<p>Sweet believed the issue was resolved at the time, but the administration presented a formal charge against him and suspended him approximately two and a half months later.</p>\n<p>According to Sweet’s personal inquiry into the matter, the details of the complaint were not the same as Sweet’s understanding of the encounter.</p>\n<p>Sweet was allegedly told that he “stalked” the female undergraduate trainee, “waited until she was alone” and “harassed and bullied her” before she fled, according to Sweet’s Facebook post.</p>\n<p>“The allegation and all of its add-ons are just flat out false,” he said.</p>\n<p>As of late October, Sweet is unable to access his on-campus office and teach classes.</p>\n<p>In an updated Facebook post on Oct. 24, Sweet said one of his courses is canceled and the other is being taught by a grad student.</p>\n<p>“I think this is an example of how hypersensitivity to sexual harassment can be used unfairly to try to settle scores,” Sweet said. “I don’t know what score is being settled here, but it is causing a lot of disruption, not simply to my good name.”</p>\n<p>“I am aware that former students and scientific colleagues worldwide have reacted with incredulity… UCSB is getting a monstrous black eye over this.”</p>\n<p>UCSB did not offer an official statement regarding Sweet’s case.</p>\n<p>Sweet’s full Facebook post can be viewed <a

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Daily Nexus archives</em></p></div>\n<p>In response to the demands set forth by the protesters, the Department of Black Studies was established.</p>\n<p>The creation of that department paved the way for additional departments such as the Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies, the Department of Feminist Studies and the Department of Asian American Studies.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think in retrospect that we fully understood or comprehended the significance and the lifetime gravity that that event represented,” Murad Rahman, chair of the Black Student Union (BSU) in 1968, said.</p>\n<p>“We certainly by no means did we know and fully understand all of it … maybe until years and years after that, in my opinion.”</p>\n<p>Rahman remembers the events of Oct. 14 that year clearly.</p>\n<p>He and the 11 other students shouldered uncertainty, risk and, most of all, unwavering resolve as they took over North Hall.</p>\n<p>At the time, North Hall held the mainframe computer for the entire UC system and was considered “the most critical point” of the campus, Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Rahman and other students attended UCSB during a time of tumultuous social and political climate. Significant moments, such as the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy as well as the rise of prominence of Malcolm X and the Black Power Movement, created the backdrop against which students experienced college life.</p>\n<p>Being among the small number of African American students at the time provided a difficult environment to navigate, Cynthia Davis, secretary for BSU in 1968, recalled.</p>\n<p>“There was a[n] identity crisis because we were such a minority there on campus,” Davis said. “Because of that fact, sort of being isolated like that … we tried to find ways where we could group together to support one another.”</p>\n<p>BSU was an important avenue for African American students to support each other and discuss the challenges they faced as students at UCSB and a minority race in the 1960s, according to Davis.</p>\n<p>Students of BSU worked to raise awareness about issues faced by African American students and fight for changes they felt would benefit their community and black communities throughout the nation, Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Dalton Nezey, a football player in 1968 and one of North Hall Takeover participants, joined forces with Rahman and other BSU members in discussion about what the school needed to be doing better for its black students.</p>\n<p>Several of those discussions revolved around the mistreatment of black athletes on the football team, which included the lack of financial aid given to black athletes in comparison to their white counterparts, the use of derogatory language by coaching staff and the general lack of respect black students were given.</p>\n<p>“We felt that we were being treated differently, and … in that conversation about football, we started looking at the structure of the campus,” Nezey said.</p>\n<p>These complaints, coupled with “racial insensitivity, [and] racial illiteracy” on campus as well as the national social strife at the time, were the final catalyst for the North Hall Takeover, Rahman said.</p>\n<p>In secret – from the public as well as most members of the BSU at the time – Rahman, Nezey and other students devised a plan to secure the computer center at North Hall and demand changes at UCSB from the chancellor at the time, Vernon Cheadle.</p>\n<p>Students planned the “high-risk operation” two weeks in advance.</p>\n<p>BSU members located all the exits in the building, prepared for attempted infiltration from police and threats of violence. They also determined how they would communicate and negotiate with key players on the outside.</p>\n<p>Even on the morning of the Takeover, some of the protestors, though resolved in their mission, were apprehensive about what the rest of the day would entail.</p>\n<p>“We knew we were doing the right thing … the question was, how fearful were we of the consequences? That was the issue,” Thomas Crenshaw, one of the protestors, said.</p>\n<p>“Were we fearful? Yeah, we were fearful. Were we afraid? Yeah, we were afraid. There were a lot of us who met to go into North Hall. Only 12 of us showed up.”</p>\n<p>The 12 students arrived at North Hall around 6 a.m. on Oct. 14, when they anticipated the halls would be empty of workers and students. The protestors convinced the few technicians who were present to leave after explaining the gravity of the situation about to take place.</p>\n<p>The students had coordinated a team on the outside to facilitate negotiations at the chancellor’s office while the 12 remained barricaded inside North Hall.</p>\n<p>Booker Banks, another member of the 12 inside the building, addressed the crowd gathered outside the building throughout the day. He kept them both informed and entertained during the negotiations.</p>\n<p>“[Banks] was very, very crucial in making the whole operation a success and in winning over the minds and hearts of students [so] that what we were doing inside and the whole operation was a positive and constructive event,” Rahman said.</p>\n<p>It was late afternoon when the 12 received word the chancellor’s office had agreed to the demands.</p>\n<p>“It was a moment of celebration, a moment of relief because we didn’t know whether or not our demands were going to be met,” Rahman said.</p>\n<p>50 years later, the North Hall Takeover remains one of the most significant actions take by BSU and has had reverberating effects on campus.</p>\n<p>But the advancements set in motion by these students’ actions were far greater than they could have imagined at the time.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84425\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84425\" data-attachment-id=\"84425\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/50-years-ago-12-students-and-the-takeover-that-changed-everything/50th-anniversary_online-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"50th anniversary_ONLINE-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-84425\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=1832%2C1374&amp;ssl=1 1832w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=1376%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84425\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Several of the 12 protestors gathered at UCSB to celebrate the Takeover’s 50th anniversary. <em>Courtesy of Professor Jeffrey Stewart</em></p></div>\n<p>“What’s really amazing to me is to look at all the pictures and see yourself in these pictures at 18, 19 years old not realizing that you’re contributing to history at the time but that you have made history,” Davis said.</p>\n<p>“You feel very proud that you happen to be in the right place at the right time to make such a positive contribution.”</p>\n<p>Many of the participants cite the Takeover as a significant moment in their lives, both shaping their time at UCSB as well as the future they would go on to have.</p>\n<p>“[My involvement] shows and is an indication to my children and my grandchildren as to sacrifices that sometimes have to made in order for progress to be attained,” Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Rahman now works as a supervising case manager for a community organization in Los Angeles working toward gang prevention.</p>\n<p>Davis also attributes her time in BSU as “stirr[ing] up in me the importance to learn more about my heritage, to be proud of who I was and to be in a position to fight for basic civil rights.”</p>\n<p>She currently works as an assistant professor at Charles R.

id=\"caption-attachment-70795\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Doe’s suspension was reversed earlier this month. <em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The case, <em>John Doe</em> v. <em>University of California Regents</em>, focuses on two students referred to as Jane Roe and John Doe in court documents.</p>\n<p>Doe was officially suspended from UCSB in 2016 after Roe accused him of sexually assaulting her on June 26, 2015.</p>\n<p>UCSB placed Doe on interim suspension beginning Sept. 16, 2015, while the school investigated Roe’s claim. He was officially suspended for eight quarters following a hearing from the Sexual/Interpersonal Violence Conduct Committee.</p>\n<p>Two weeks ago, the SB Superior Court court found that Doe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>was denied access to critical evidence – a copy of a report that described Roe’s alleged injuries following the assault – during the hearing;</li>\n<li>was denied the opportunity to “adequately cross-examine witnesses,” including Roe herself and Doe’s mother, among others;</li>\n<li>and was denied the opportunity to present evidence, such as information regarding Roe’s antidepressant medication, in his defense.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“It is ironic that an institution of higher learning, where American history and government are taught, should stray so far from the principles that underlie our democracy,” court documents read.</p>\n<p>Doe will be rewarded some form of compensation, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>This is the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-08-15/uc-regents-found-in-contempt-of-court-expelled-student-allowed-to-return-to-ucsb/\">second reversal</a> of a UCSB Title IX case the <em>Nexus</em> has reported on in recent months.</p>\n<p><strong>JANE ROE</strong></p>\n<p>Roe said Doe sexually assaulted her that night at Doe’s girlfriend’s apartment. Doe’s girlfriend is referred to in court documents as Eyewitness One.</p>\n<p>Roe had consumed wine, beer and mango margaritas that night and said she had felt “pretty drunk” and decided to sleep on the bottom bunk of a bunk bed in the apartment’s living room.</p>\n<p>She stated she woke at an unknown time, “completely disoriented,” to an “intense, throbbing pain.”</p>\n<p>Roe said she pretended to be asleep because she did not want a confrontation while her assaulter allegedly “unhooked [her] bra”; “suck[ed] and bit” her for several minutes; “[took] photos of her naked breasts” and repeatedly “penetrated [her] vagina and anus” with his fingers and/or penis.</p>\n<p>She said she realized it was Doe when her assaulter stopped and got up from the bed, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>Roe was medically examined by the Santa Barbara County Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) two days after the alleged assault.</p>\n<p>The SART report said there was “bruising and laceration noted in the anal area,” according to University of California Police Department (UCPD) Detective Dawn Arviso.</p>\n<p>However, neither Roe nor the detective provided a full copy of the SART report with this information attached during the trial.</p>\n<p>“The SART report was critical evidence,” court documents state. “At a minimum UCSB should have required the detective to provide a complete copy of the SART report.”</p>\n<p>Roe’s story that night also conflicted with Eyewitness One’s report.</p>\n<p>Following the alleged assault, Roe said Eyewitness One approached the bed and screamed when she saw that Roe’s “bottom half” was completely bare.</p>\n<p>Eyewitness One testified over Skype that Roe was wearing a short-sleeve shirt and underwear when she got up from the bed, contradicting Roe’s claim. She also denied screaming.</p>\n<p>The mattress was also absent of “any visible signs or smells of bodily fluids” consistent with anal or vaginal penetration, according to Eyewitness One.</p>\n<p><strong>JOHN DOE</strong></p>\n<p>Doe denied all of Roe’s accusations.</p>\n<p>He said he arrived at the apartment at approximately 12:30 a.m. that night and was “very intoxicated.”</p>\n<p>By Eyewitness One’s recommendation, he lay down, fully dressed, on the bottom bunk next to Roe because the top bunk was covered in luggage. He reportedly first heard about Doe’s allegations when she “woke [him] up by basically yelling about someone hurting her.”</p>\n<p>He argued three main points in his defense:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The distance between the couch and the bunk bed in the living room was too close for him to have done anything without being noticed by Eyewitness One and Eyewitness Two.</li>\n<li>He could not have unhooked Roe’s bra because his neurological disorder, a “form of palsy,” affects his motor skills when he is tired or drunk.</li>\n<li>Roe’s antidepressant medication, Viibryd, has side effects including hallucinations, sleep paralysis and night terrors, which can become severe when mixed with alcohol.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Doe was not allowed to include the antidepressant medication evidence in his defense because he did not have an expert present, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>The SB Superior Court stated he was not given enough time to find an expert, again showing a lack of due process.</p>\n<p>The full court documents can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/B283229.pdf\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
