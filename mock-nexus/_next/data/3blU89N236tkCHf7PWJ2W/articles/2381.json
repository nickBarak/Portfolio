I wasn’t always a gloomy shmuck.</p>\n<p>Part of it is that I blew my shoulder out on a nothing-special head-high wave this winter break, just trying to avoid running some kook over.</p>\n<p>Now I’m faced with a shoulder injury that has had me out of the water and unable to do more than lift my backpack for the last month. With no hope for a quick recovery in sight, my surf withdrawals are getting hectic. I creep out my surf peers in my crippled state, standing on my balcony and sighing as I watch the waves roll in. The past two weeks of solid swell have been particularly hard to overcome.</p>\n<p>Today I realized that my next quarter will be my last here. And given the funk I’m already in, I couldn’t help but dwell on regrets that I’ve steadily tried to deny.</p>\n<p>Some were pretty mundane. I could’ve done more schoolwork. I could’ve raged less. It might have done me well to see past the beer goggles on occasion. I could’ve conducted myself with accountability in mind.</p>\n<p>Not shockingly, my most striking regret is that I didn’t surf more.</p>\n<p>In retrospect, I’d probably be a happier person right now if I had skipped class and gone surfing a couple dozen more times every quarter. I think I’d top the dean’s list, be less sloppy and more driven if I had gotten up for the sunrise every day.</p>\n<p>Sure, waves might not always reach expectations, but if you set your minimum surf quota at taking a paddle in placid Lake Pacific, a surf session is about the most wholesome thing there is. Even the tiniest little urine-splatter-sized ripple of a wave can appease your soul.</p>\n<p>At the same time, time between sessions can be some of the most agonizing tear-out-your-face-with-a-crowbar periods of your life.</p>\n<p>Do you remember the story of Anton Pavlov, and his experiments with conditioning? Long story short, dogs were found to begin salivating at the sound of a bell because it made them anticipate a meal. Trained to come to dinner at the sound of a bell, they would even salivate when a bell rang even without the meal being prepared.</p>\n<p>Surfing has a similar effect on me.  Well, not completely similar — no one cut a hole in my belly — but I have been conditioned by the pursuit of surf. Now, the dull roar of waves from my I.V. bedroom, the mention of a barrel, the sight of a set from my DP apartment and any moment of weakness when I boot up Surfline all get the surf juices flowing. But now that I can’t dig into the juicy surf buffet that I.V. has been offering the past few weeks, my manifest surf destiny has become a burden.</p>\n<p>So learn from me. Now that I am wary of surfing for fear of re-injury, I can see all the missed opportunities.</p>\n<p>Sure, you may have that business presentation with the TMP program that you can’t show up to all salty with I.V. run-off dripping out of your nose.  And you’ve got that fucking midterm tomorrow already and you haven’t bought the course reader yet. You might have developed an affection for scotch.</p>\n<p>Let me tell you now, all those commitments you have — they’re mainly indulgences. They will keep you from the ultimate pursuit.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus <em>Surf Columnist Elliott Rosenfeld wasn’t crying, he swears.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students work at a table inside the McNair scholars room. <em>Hugh Cook/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>President Donald Trump’s education budget released on May 23 calls for a $9.2 billion rollback in spending for several educational programs. Among them, the McNair Scholars Program may face the steepest cut.</p>\n<p>The McNair Post Baccalaureate Achievement is a federal scholarship offered to first-generation, low-income students or those who belong to underrepresented minorities in the United States. By pushing these students toward doctoral degrees, the program hopes to diversify faculty in universities across the country.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara began the McNair program in 2007, and it has since guided over 50 students to masters and Ph.D. programs. Though UCSB houses a smaller department than other universities, current and former McNair scholars say their education would have been impossible without it.</p>\n<p>Jamelia Harris, a first-year doctoral student at UC Los Angeles, graduated from UCSB last year with the university’s highest honors — the Thomas More Storke Award. She began her first year at UCSB as a biochemistry major, but she said the McNair program guided her to understand the impact of research as a social scientist.</p>\n<p>“Ph.D.s are nonexistent in my network of family members and friends,” Harris said. Growing up in a predominantly black, low-resource community in Lancaster, Calif., she said she was always “tracked” into higher level courses.</p>\n<p>Her experiences, and those of her family, led her to pursue research in segregated education within the same community. She now focuses on black female’s vulnerability to policing and discrimination in schooling.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78222\" style=\"width: 688px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"670327053\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78283\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78222\" data-attachment-id=\"78222\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/mcnair-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg?fit=1356%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1356,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"McNair 3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg?fit=678%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78222 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3-678x1024.jpg?resize=678%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"678\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg?resize=678%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 678w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1160&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg?w=1356&amp;ssl=1 1356w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78222\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Volumes of research from McNair scholars are arranged on a bookshelf. <em>Hugh Cook/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have not met a student of color across all six schools [I was admitted to] who was admitted directly from undergrad without the support of McNair,” she said. “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that speaks volumes to the level of support that McNair offers for many of us who are first-generation college students.”</span></p>\n<p>Though McNair has guided several students from their second undergraduate year to a Ph.D., the White House believes its progress is inefficient. In an off-camera briefing on May 22, the Office of Management and Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney, said the McNair program had not accomplished its objectives.</p>\n<p>“The last time the Department of Education looked at this, it was 6 percent effective — 6 percent,” Mulvaney said.  “I can’t do that anymore.  We can’t do that anymore.  We cannot defend programs like that — 6 percent just doesn’t cut it.”</p>\n<p>Beth Schneider, UCSB McNair program chair, said Mulvaney’s statement lacks context. When she read the proposal, she said, “I was shocked — but not surprised.”</p>\n<p>Approximately 1 percent of undergraduates graduating in 2005 earned their doctorate by 2015, according to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In comparison, Schneider said, a 6 percent doctorate rate for McNair scholars is a vast improvement.</p>\n<p>Still, the U.S. Department of Education (D.O.E.) report says “McNair is a high cost per-participant program that serves relatively few students.” There is limited evidence of effectiveness for both of these programs,” the<a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget18/summary/18summary.pdf\"> report</a> reads.</p>\n<p>Schneider acknowledged that this is true — the McNair program serves a niche group of students at a high cost — but explained that it is essential to prompt students toward a graduate education if they are to return to UCSB as a diverse group of educators.</p>\n<p>Syrian Truong, a transfer student who plans to apply to graduate school next year, began the McNair program after moving to Santa Barbara from Fresno. Truong is gay, a first-generation student and a multiracial Asian-Latino American. For people who don’t experience educational barriers as a part of their daily life, he said, the value of structural support is difficult to explain.</p>\n<p>“There’s a certain amount of condescension as you start moving higher and higher up … you look around and you start seeing less and less of people that look like you,” he said. “For me, that was never a problem before, but it starts to get grating.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78223\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1357638069\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78283\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78223\" data-attachment-id=\"78223\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/mcnair-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1357&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1357\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"McNair 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?fit=888%2C589&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78223 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1-1024x679.jpg?resize=888%2C589\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"589\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C679&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78223\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photos of McNair scholars and faculty advisors line the walls of the McNair program trailer next the Veteran Resource Center at UCSB. <em>Hugh Cook/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The concept of graduate school appealed to Truong as a first-year at UCSB, but he said it would have been “a much harder road” without the McNair program. He now does research in theoretical physics, specifically through condensed matter theory and statistical mechanics, and is looking toward a Ph.D.</p>\n<p>“If that support was given to other students …  maybe it doesn’t bring the next Einstein,” he said. “But it could bring a lot of good change, inventions and a lot of progress in the world.”</p>\n<p>The D.O.E. currently allows McNair scholars 10 years to complete their Ph.D. Each university records and submits its own data, but according to McNair supporters, the D.O.E. has not consolidated this data properly. As a result, the D.O.E. report used possibly outdated information spanning from 1989 to 2000.</p>\n<p>Schneider said the D.O.E.<a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/highered/mcnair/mcnair.pdf\"> study</a> does not match trends at UCSB, where each cohort since 2007 has either surpassed the 6 percent doctorate rate or is well on its way to meeting this percentage.</p>\n<p>Last year, Harris and several other students spoke to UC President Janet Napolitano to push for a more proportionate number of faculty to match the amount of black Californians.</p>\n<p>“If we have the president of an entire University of California admittedly saying that these programs are necessary for the improving the retention and recruitments of faculty of colors,  I personally don’t see why our actions aren’t embodying those sentiments,” she said.</p>\n<p>After the federal budget was proposed last week, Napolitano spoke out against the proposed cuts. Though she focused on rollbacks to the National Science Foundation and energy science programs, she said the proposed cuts could affect more than 133,000 UC students.</p>\n<p>“As president of the nation’s largest public research university, I urge Congress to immediately begin work on a revised budget proposal that makes meaningful investments to help our students, protect our patients and keep America’s research enterprise preeminent,” Napolitano said in a statement.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, June 1, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78283\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78283\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/","id":2380,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2379,2378,2377],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Scam-Free Ticketing Platform Wins New Venture Competition","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-05-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0393.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0393.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This year’s New Venture Competition’s first-place winner is CRYPTIX, a ticketing platform which uses blockchain technology to make the process safer by eliminating fraud and scalpers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s New Venture Competition’s first-place winner is CRYPTIX, a ticketing platform which uses blockchain technology to make the process safer by eliminating fraud and scalpers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They received the first place prize of $10,000 to continue the development of their company.

The seller made 10 copies of the exact same ticket and sold it to 10 different people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So every day, for the next three days of the festival, it was a race to be the first in line. Only the first ticket would show up as valid, and the other nine would be invalid,” Martitsch said. “So needless to say, this was a terrible experience for me.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delta Leaf Labs, a team developing THC- free marijuana, won the second place prize of $7,500 and the $5,000 Elings award for a total of $12,500 — walking away with the most cash prizes. California recently passed Proposition 64, legalizing marijuana, which leaves them with no close competition anywhere in the state.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wanderlease, a website designed to make subleasing easier, won $5,000 dollars for third place. The six team members are all part of Alpha Kappa Psi, a co-ed professional business fraternity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shikha Sharma, a fourth-year political science major, said he thought of the idea for the website after having a difficult time finding housing while interning in New York. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The people’s choice award went to Collatera, a startup that has created a bandage-type patch which could be applied on diabetic foot ulcers. It heals foot ulcers up to four times faster than similar patches currently on the market. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team won $5,000 as well as a honorary award of $2,500. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team has completed trial studies on mice and will start live clinical trials at Harvard University and Tufts Medical Center this summer.
