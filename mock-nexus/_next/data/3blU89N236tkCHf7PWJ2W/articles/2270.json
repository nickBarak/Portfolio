Active campaigning for all candidates began on Thursday.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below are the candidate’s priorities and plans if elected:</span></p>\n<p><b>FIRST PRIORITY:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nagpal wants to decrease indirect student costs and work to expand the Textbook Buyback Program so students get 80 percent of their money back. He would also like to work to install charging stations around campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medina wants to implement a “backdoor” policy for C.A.P.S. which would allow students who might be visibly anxious to be able to come into C.A.P.S. without anyone seeing them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moon is interested in collaborating with the External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) office and the Lobby Corps to fight tuition hikes and said he plans to write resolutions to support their efforts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malamed said he wants to ensure that students have access to feminine hygiene products and contraceptives in the residence halls so students are relieved of the burden of any additional costs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an effort to increase accountability and transparency on campus, Toubian wants quarterly teacher evaluations to be publicly posted so students can make informed decisions when picking classes. If there are recurring problems with a professor, Toubian said she wants students to be able to hold the administration accountable. </span></p>\n<p><b>CAMPUS SAFETY:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moon said people might not feel safe calling the police because they are worried about being penalized, but said he wants to increase students’ awareness of the policies that do not punish people reporting issues like drug or alcohol overdose. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian wants to expand the Community Service Organization (CSO) escort system as she once waited alone for 45 minutes for a CSO officer. She said she also wants to create a shuttle service to and from I.V. in university-owned vans or buses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medina wants to institute a shuttle system between the Santa Catalina residence halls and the main campus as well as provide carts or vehicles to CSOs so they can better help students get home safely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malamed said he wants to increase the number of on-campus students on the Sexual Assault Board and work with the Residential Housing Association to ensure students on campus feel safe reporting sexual assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nagpal said he wants more students living in the residence halls to know about resources like </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus Advocacy Resources &amp; Education Center</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well as expand the blue light system on campus and in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students can vote in the A.S. election on G.O.L.D. from April 23 to April 26.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-83142\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>As outgoing external vice president for statewide affairs, Kristin Hsu said the position and all the work that came with it lived up to her expectations.</p>\n<p>“I felt like I had a lot of insight coming into office … I made sure I knew what I was getting myself into,” she said.</p>\n<p>Her position as UC Santa Barbara’s external vice president for statewide affairs (EVPSA) required her to advocate on behalf of the student body to the University of California Regents, UC Office of the President and other partner organizations with Associated Students (A.S.).</p>\n<p>Hsu told the <em>Nexus</em> she believes she successfully addressed all of her campaign platforms during her year in office.</p>\n<p>She ran on a platform of advocating to legislators for the “rights, resources, and representation of students across the state and nation.”</p>\n<p>During her time as EVPSA, Hsu focused on preventing a tuition increase for the 2018-2019 school year that the UC Regents were planning to impose in response to the lack of state funding.</p>\n<p>Hsu went on a number of advocacy trips throughout the year to advocate on behalf of UCSB students to encourage the UC Regents to listen to student needs including advocating for bills regarding sexual assault, violence and harassment on campus.</p>\n<p>Because of the work Hsu and other student advocates have been doing to prevent this increase, the Regents <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-29/uc-regents-postpone-vote-on-tuition-hike/\">postponed the vote</a> to raise in-state tuition until the end of May and have instead begun partnering with students to advocate for more funding from the state, Hsu said.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Hsu, along with UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang, A.S. President Hieu Le and other university members went to Sacramento to meet with legislators and lobby for “budget asks and what [A.S.] determines to be priorities.”</p>\n<p>The group asked legislators for $140 million to address “deferred maintenance, over enrollment [for the 2017-18 school year] and buying out the tuition increase.”</p>\n<p>The latter was in response to Governor Brown’s proposed budget for the UC, which was significantly less than the Regents expected.</p>\n<p>The results of their efforts will be seen in June when the legislators create a budget for the UC and submit it to the House and Senate.</p>\n<p>In addition to lobbying for students, Hsu promised to “advocate for the establishment of a campus-based Middle Class Scholarship for UCSB students as a response to the elimination of the CA Middle Class Scholarship.”</p>\n<p>Initially, Brown planned to eliminate it, but later decided not to following public and legislative backlash.</p>\n<p>Since the scholarship was never eliminated a replacement was not necessary to implement, Hsu said.</p>\n<p>Hsu also fulfilled her goal of bringing all candidates running for California Governor to UCSB to speak with students.</p>\n<p>Governor Candidate Delaine Eastin visited UCSB on Earth Day, Antonio Villaraigosa will be visiting in a few weeks, and both John Chiang and Gavin Newsom are planning to visit before the June 5 primaries, according to Hsu.</p>\n<p>Hsu’s final platform item stated she would “collaborate with key state and student organizers to work on a system-wide campaign to reclaim the cost of higher education during the 2018 election.” Hsu said she has worked with Reclaim California’s Higher Education Coalition throughout the school year to create an informational video, released in October, that explains how people of all backgrounds can achieve higher education.</p>\n<p>“In some shape or form I have responded to all my platorm points,” Hsu said.</p>\n<p>Hsu said she is most proud of helping unite students voices at UCSB with state legislators who can make changes to the higher education system, specifically in regards to their fight for increased budgets.</p>\n<p>“It’s always been a struggle of whether these powers or institutions or higher authorities will take students seriously,” she said. “I think this year the work that UCSB students have done really shows that we are a force to be reckoned with.”</p>\n<p>Hsu said the money the EVPSA’s office received for the 2017-2018 school year went to funding their advocacy trips and events the office hosted throughout the year, including the GOP tax panel last fall, which featured Congressman Salud Carbajal.</p>\n<p>“This panel was set to inform people about how [the GOP tax] would affect both undergraduate and graduate students alike,” she said.</p>\n<p>Hsu also partnered with Rose Le, the EVPSA office’s mental health coordinator, to organize a panel for the science, technology, engineering and mathematics students on campus to aid them in maintaining their mental health amidst the stresses of their heavy class load.</p>\n<p>Nushi Yapabandara, the Re-Ignite coordinator for EVPSA, praised Hsu and the rest of the team for the work they were able to accomplish this year.</p>\n<p>“[The EVPSA is] one of the most productive A.S. exec offices and I am going to miss being able to work with such down-to-earth people in the ‘real world,’” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>Yapabandara and Hsu partnered together to work on projects including the establishment of permIGNITE, an organization on campus that works to “empower the marginalized voices that proudly exist within the UC campuses and beyond,” according to the EVPSA’s Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Hsu said the biggest challenge that both she and her team faced over the year was time.</p>\n<p>“Everyone else works on this regular calendar year January through December, but student leaders work May to May which is odd,” she said.</p>\n<p>Hsu said the unusual time differences were difficult because students live such different lives than regular government officials.</p>\n<p>Hsu’s elected successor was fourth-year global and Chicanx studies double major Mayela Morales, who was later <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualified from her position</a> by A.S. Elections Board on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>As she transitions out of her position, Hsu wants the student body to know about all the hard work that both she and the rest of A.S. do throughout the year.</p>\n<p>“A.S. is really a space for students to be their own advocates and … to feel empowered on the issues that they care about,” Hsu said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the May 17, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83141\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83141\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/","id":2268,"author":{"id":88,"name":"Katie Wolf"},"related":[2267,2266,2265],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"AFSCME Strike Comes to an End, A.S.

electrical equipment was associated with an ignition near Koenigstein Road in Santa Paula — one of at least two origin points for the Thomas Fire,” Southern California Edison (SCE) said in press release sent out on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>However, the statement noted that there were other factors that contributed to the Thomas Fire, including dry vegetation, high temperatures and strong winds.</p>\n<p>“Wildfire risk is increasing at the same time as more and more residential and commercial development is occurring in some of the highest-risk areas — with over a quarter of SCE’s service territory in high fire risk areas identified on the CPUC’s (California Public Utilities Commision) fire risk maps,” the press release stated.</p>\n<p>SCE is now awaiting permission from the California Department of Forestry &amp; Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) to further their investigation into the causes of the Thomas Fire.</p>\n<p>According to the press release, CAL FIRE has removed equipment located near Koenigstein Road, so SCE has not yet been able to inspect it. “SCE will not be able to determine the specific cause of the Koenigstein Road ignition until it can analyze the equipment currently in CAL FIRE’s possession.”</p>\n<p>According to the press release, SCE is conducting an ongoing study regarding the causes of the Thomas Fire. This study takes an in-depth look into possible ignition points and fire progression from each point, among other factors.</p>\n<p>SCE is one of the largest electric utility companies in the U.S., serving about 15 million customers in Southern California, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire devastated the Santa Barbara area last December, burning over 281,893 acres of land. It was the largest fire in California history at the time, until it was surpassed by the Mendocino Complex Fire in July 2018.</p>\n<p>During the fire, UC Santa Barbara <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-05/uc-santa-barbara-gym-will-accept-nearly-200-evacuees-from-thomas-fire/\">opened</a> its recreation center to evacuees from the Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Associated Students Senate also <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-15/a-s-senate-allocates-5000-to-help-students-head-home-during-thomas-fire/\">allocated</a> over $2,000 to students who needed to return home because of the fire.
