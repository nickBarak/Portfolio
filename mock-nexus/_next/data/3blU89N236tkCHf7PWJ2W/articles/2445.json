A dean will be selected by July of this year. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The College of Creative Studies (CCS) Vetting Committee is in the midst of searching for a new dean of the college, increasing transparency in the process by inviting students and faculty to participate in the vetting process.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang and Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall created the committee in April 2016 and began their search for a new dean of the college during Fall Quarter. The committee has opened town hall meetings to the public during which the applicants are interviewed for the position.</p>\n<p>The committee will vet the candidates and compile their recommendations for the position to give to Chancellor Yang, who will then choose the new dean by July.</p>\n<p>The position is open to faculty from all departments on campus and initially received around 80 applications. The committee has narrowed the application pool down to four applicants, two from science departments and two from the humanities departments.</p>\n<p>Various constituencies on campus are meeting with the candidates as the committee holds interviews, encouraging participants to have a role in the process, said Omer Blaes, chair of the Vetting Committee and a professor in the physics department.</p>\n<p>“Everyone who has participated in one of these events is free to send us information about their reactions, and we take that information in a confidential fashion,” Blaes said. “The committee evaluates that when considering who we want to recommend to the Chancellor.”</p>\n<p>Blaes has chaired other search committees, including that for the dean of the College of Letters and Sciences, and said while campus-wide interviews were held, there were few people on campus aware of the proceedings. He said everyone in the college was invited because members of CCS wanted more transparency in the vetting and decision-making process.</p>\n<p>The committee also reached out to faculty members in the applicants’ departments to join the meetings and offer advice about the candidates.</p>\n<p>Kathleen Foltz, the interim dean of CSS, said she believes it is “crucial” for candidates to interact with students and faculty at the town hall meetings.</p>\n<p>“You want to have candidates meet with people, and in this position in particular, to meet especially with the students,” Foltz said in an email. “I think it’s wonderful that so many students can meet these candidates and offer feedback to the Search Advisory Committee.”</p>\n<p>Foltz said this type of transparency is common for a candidate search at the administrative level.</p>\n<p>Bruce Tiffney, the previous dean of the college, stepped down from his position in July, and Foltz stepped in to temporarily serve as the dean while the committee vets applicants for the position. Foltz said she is not applying to be the permanent dean.</p>\n<p>Applicants for the administrative position go through a vetting process and answer a series of questions relating to their interest in the dean position and their administrative and leadership experience.</p>\n<p>There are eight majors in CCS, and Blaes stressed the importance of a dean working cohesively with each of them, focusing on undergraduate students’ research and creative processes.</p>\n<p>“The key aspect about this particular dean is that this dean is undergraduate-focused,” Blaes said. “They need to enable bright undergraduates [in] … the creative fields they’re engaged in.”</p>\n<p>He added that the vetting process has allowed the involved faculty members from different departments to interact and discuss the future of the college.</p>\n<p>“It’s one of the rare occasions that I am talking to people from the humanities about what CCS could be and what the whole campus could be in terms of bridging these very different disciplines,” Blaes said.</p>\n<p>“[The college] is what it is now and it’s viewed as a success, but because it brings together people in these different disciplines it could even serve as a nexus for faculty on the campus.”</p>\n<p>After the new dean is chosen, the candidate’s department will need to appoint a new faculty member to the vacancy subsequently created, a process the CCS Vetting Committee will not be a part of.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the new dean will not be expected to teach since the CCS dean position is a full-time commitment.</p>\n<p>“I have great hopes for this position,” Blaes said. “Everyone says CCS is a jewel in the crown at UCSB, and I really believe that. And I hope that we get someone who can make that jewel even greater.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

the effects of this increase, as 1,000 more students enrolled for the 2016-17 school year than the 2015-16 year.</p>\n<p>In March, the Chemistry Department faced challenges trying to accommodate upper division students in the 116BL course, a prerequisite needed to complete the major. Over 20 students were waitlisted, with no facility space to add another lab.</p>\n<p>Rachel Alvelais, a third-year chemistry major, had extensive concerns regarding whether she would be able to graduate on time.</p>\n<p>“For most of us juniors, at this point in time we start to think about graduate school applications, which are due at the middle or end of Fall Quarter,” Alvelais said. “If we have to stay an extra Fall Quarter, then that means that we can’t apply to graduate school next year and we would have to find something to do … for a whole 13 months while we already would have been in graduate school.”</p>\n<p>Taking a summer class, an option that has been offered by several departments, is a choice that does not appeal to students like Alvelais, who did not initially plan to take summer courses and have other internship or research obligations.</p>\n<p>Alvelais, however, said she feels that if she was not able to get into the lab course needed to graduate, she would have no choice but to take summer classes, despite the financial burden.</p>\n<p>The department added more students to each existing lab class, and Alvelais was able to take the class she needed to graduate and do research over the summer; however, her experience is indicative of a more widespread problem.</p>\n<p>Steven Buratto, chair of the Chemistry Department, said he is concerned about a lack of resources for the increasing number of enrolled students.</p>\n<p>“The University of California is great. You get a great education for a reasonable price, comparatively speaking,” Buratto said. “But we don‘t want to get so overcrowded that we can’t accommodate the students that we have.”</p>\n<p>The Chemistry and Biology Departments face issues with physical lab space, a lack of graduate students to work as teaching assistants and a lack of faculty.</p>\n<p>“We’ve reached our capacity, and so at some point throwing money at it doesn’t work,” said Stephen Poole, chair of the Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology (MCDB) Department. “You need faculty to teach these students, you need graduate students to work as TAs, so money could help there; we could expand our graduate program.”</p>\n<p>These restrictions are not felt only within S.T.E.M. fields.</p>\n<p>Alison Brysk, the global studies department chair, said the department also faces similar space restrictions: Designated class sizes are quickly surpassing the physical capacity of lecture halls.</p>\n<p>Such restrictions make certain classes more competitive in terms of enrollment, which limits the ability of non-global studies majors to enroll in popular global studies courses.</p>\n<p>Though other UCs have begun offering classes during the evening, there are several challenges to doing this at UCSB. Poole said this is not a viable solution due to the staff needed to prepare labs and the fact that certain lecture halls, like Campbell Hall, are used for other purposes at night.</p>\n<p>Many departments also lack qualified TAs, which limits the departments’ abilities to provide further assistance for undergraduate students.</p>\n<p>“Graduate students are critical to both the teaching and research missions of our university,” Napolitano said in a statement. “They serve key roles in supporting the academic inquiry and discovery of our faculty, as well as the teaching load for our undergraduates.”</p>\n<p>UCSB, however, has not increased the number of graduate students sufficiently; according to campus profiles authored by the university’s Office of Budget and Planning, this year there were 73 less new graduate students than there were for the 2015-16 year.</p>\n<p>Larger class sizes are difficult for students to get into and in many cases can negatively affect students’ learning experiences.</p>\n<p>Jerry Chung, the education coordinator for the actuarial science department, said large class sizes hinder students’ ability to interact with each other and increase their own knowledge.</p>\n<p>“An unintended consequence of huge classes is that students in the actuarial science major find it increasingly difficult to network and learn from one another,” Chung said.</p>\n<p>To combat this issue, students in the department have created UCSB’s Actuarial Association, which hosts educational and social events to network with each other.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the effects of increased enrollment extend past the classroom.</p>\n<p>This March, Wyatt Licht, a fourth-year communication major, started a petition to stop bike impounding across campus. The petition alleged that there were not enough bike racks on campus for all students, a sentiment that 481 petition-signers agreed with.</p>\n<p>Student services such as Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) have also been affected.</p>\n<p>“It certainly affects the demand for our services; there’s more students on campus, which means there’s more students wanting or needing mental health services,” said C.A.P.S director Jeanne Stanford.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have enough space,” Stanford added. “So if we had more space then we would be able to hire more psychologists, and if we had more psychologists then we would be able to accommodate more students.”</p>\n<p>Between 10 to 15 percent of students use C.A.P.S., and with outreach programs, Stanford estimates that they are able to reach around 25 percent of the student population.</p>\n<p>She said that an increase in population density in a small space increases “irritability, frustration [and] anxiety.”</p>\n<p>Stanford also said increased enrollment extends past C.A.P.S. and “affects everything,” including longer wait times at the Office of Financial Aid and the Registrar.</p>\n<p>The increasing numbers also concern undergraduate housing. While the San Joaquin Residence Hall currently under construction will help mitigate the housing strain, a significant increase in freshmen could pose problems.</p>\n<p>“If there was a dramatic increase, then we would have to strategize about how to accommodate them,” said Mario Muñoz, associate director of Resident Placement &amp; Assignment Services. “We would probably have to look at how we distribute the spaces that we have.”</p>\n<p>Chuck Haines, acting assistant chancellor of the Office of Budget and Planning, said that while we currently have enough space for students, more housing will have to be built in the future.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang told the Nexus in an interview Tuesday that the university wants to ensure that dorm rooms are no more than triples, and he said philanthropic support of campus housing is an option for the future.</p>\n<p>“Any philanthropic support of housing would lower the cost to students,” Haines said.</p>\n<p>Next year, there will be a small decrease in the number of freshmen admitted, but total undergraduate enrollment will still increase slightly due to an increased emphasis on admitting transfer students.</p>\n<p>According to Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall, UCSB has been steadily increasing enrollment according to the Long Range Development Plan (LRDP), which has a cap on enrollment at 25,000 students.</p>\n<p>State pressures to increase student enrollment, however, have forced UCSB to grow at a rate much higher than the LRDP suggests.</p>\n<p>“The state has not been very cooperative,” Marshall said. “The state has not been giving us adequate resources.”</p>\n<p>As enrollment increases, so do the costs, including C.A.P.S., faculty and other services.</p>\n<p>“We need a long-term plan,” said Yang. “I and the deans and the budget planning team are addressing this problem.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 13, 2017 print issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

The nonprofit focuses on providing parent education, low-cost childcare and preparing children to start school.</p>\n<p>Narrowly clearing its Dec. 31 fundraising deadline, IVYP completed its “$300K for $300K Match Campaign,” through a crowdfunding page, which indicated $300,033 raised on the morning of Jan. 1.</p>\n<p>Speaking about the success of the fundraiser, IVYP executive director LuAnn Miller said the “community-based campaign” had donations ranging from a penny to thousands of dollars from local foundations.</p>\n<p>The funds qualify the organization for the County of Santa Barbara’s Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), which has awarded IVYP an additional $300,000. IVYP intends to use the $600,000 to purchase the building it currently rents near the Camino Real Marketplace, closing out a mortgage of $1.2 million.</p>\n<p>“The CDBG grant from the County of Santa Barbara comprises the final payment of the mortgage, and it really was an ‘all or nothing’ … We needed to get the mortgage gap down to $300,000,” Miller said.</p>\n<p>The County of Santa Barbara reviews and selects grant recipients with a committee of 13 members organized by the Santa Barbara City Council. The committee, referred to as the Community Development and Human Services Committee (CDHSC), consists of representatives from several local groups.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74750\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74750\" data-attachment-id=\"74750\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/childrens-center-benefits-from-new-funds/ivyp-by-jose-ochoa-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IVYP-by-Jose-Ochoa-2.jpg?fit=5184%2C3456&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"5184,3456\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ivyp-by-jose-ochoa-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IVYP-by-Jose-Ochoa-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IVYP-by-Jose-Ochoa-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74750\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IVYP-by-Jose-Ochoa-2-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"LuAnn Miller, Executive Director of IVYP, personally raised $12,230 for IVYP's capital campaign last year.

Waterproof awnings have also been installed in order to protect some of the children’s equipment.</p>\n<p>According to Miller, future renovation plans include extending the tricycle path in the outdoor area, replacing a washing machine and kitchen stove and providing more natural spaces for the children to play in. In order to create more natural areas while remaining environmentally conscious, IVYP hopes to plant a succulent garden.</p>\n<p>In line with its commitment to sustainability, the center ultimately intends to install solar panels in order to curtail their energy costs. Miller said this is a way for them to use the money they save to create more programs and give back to their community.</p>\n<p>Miller said the local community’s support was critical to the fundraiser’s success.</p>\n<p>“We couldn’t have done it without the grassroots support of Isla Vista and Goleta communities,” she said. “It was the families baking cookies and doing jog-a-thons and selling raffle baskets and taco carts and penny drives … It was amazing to see the community pull together.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition

work makes the UC work” and “Pay workers enough to live in Santa Barbara County.”</p>\n<p>Union members across the state surrounded medical centers at UCLA, UCSD and UCSF. UCLA skilled trade union members were on strike for five days in protest of their low wages, marching into Westwood on Tuesday and temporarily blocking traffic.</p>\n<p>A 2015 Economic Policy Institute survey reported 92 percent of California union workers struggle to provide for themselves or their families.</p>\n<p>The UC employees’ contract expired in November and representatives from each campus have been meeting with university administration to negotiate a new contract since April, but an agreement is yet to be reached.</p>\n<p>UC has proposed an 18 percent pay increase over the next six years, but union members are saying the increase is not substantial. Furthermore, a UC spokesperson said in October that the UC “heavily subsidizes the cost of healthcare for our workers,” with those in lower paid positions contributing “as little as $47 a month for health benefits for their entire family.” The UC additionally offers a pension program with guaranteed payments on retirement.</p>\n<p>Dissenters have called the strike unlawful, but Debbie Fingerle, chief steward of UCSB Teamsters, said the stalled contract negotiations have left employees working without a contract, so the no-strike clause does not apply.</p>\n<p>“They will not negotiate in good faith,” Jedediah Johnson, office manager of the Teamsters Local 186 of Ventura, said. “We need to be at the table … and we need to learn about the cost of living and how much it actually cost with food, families [and] regulations.”</p>\n<p>Food security is another concern of the union as they battle for higher wages. According to a 2016 survey done by Teamsters Local 2010 and Occidental College, 70 percent of clerical workers struggle to buy food and 45 percent are “food insecure” and often skip meals due to a lack of resources. The survey was sent to 13,661 UC employees, and their median wage was reported to be $22.65 per hour.</p>\n<p>Brian Harwell, union member and the undergraduate advisor for the Department of Theater and Dance, said he is concerned about employees who struggle to provide food for themselves and their families.</p>\n<p>“In a higher education environment that is expensive, where you have really high pay for certain people in the university, it just seems petty and brutal,” Harwell said.</p>\n<p>Harwell said clerical employees provide a “significant role” on UC campuses, and he wants the strike to encourage understanding of the work they provide for the university.</p>\n<p>“We’re classified as clerical, but there are certain people that run the department,” Harwell said. “We have our hands in all the nuts and bolts.”</p>\n<p>Union workers hope Tuesday’s demonstration will pressure the UC to reach a contract with the employees that fulfills their demands. According to Fingerle, the union members are close to the results they want and “just need to push a little bit further” for their wage increases.</p>\n<p>“[The university is] very slow in responding, which is part of the reason we’re striking,” Fingerle said. “On a whole, they do come back with something, but it’s just not enough, and they have what we need.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74798\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uc-employees-protest-low-wages/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74798\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uc-employees-protest-low-wages/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uc-employees-protest-low-wages/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uc-employees-protest-low-wages/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uc-employees-protest-low-wages/","id":2442,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2441,2440,2439],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
