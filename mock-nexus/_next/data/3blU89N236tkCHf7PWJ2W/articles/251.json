The Aggies have won six consecutive games as their 19-6, 10-2 record matches their finish from last season.</p>\n<p>Holding a one-game lead for first place over Long Beach State, which is responsible for its two conference losses, UC Davis will play Cal Poly before hosting UCSB in its final home game of the year. If UCD manages to win its seventh straight, it would tie the longest streak in the program’s Division I history set back in both 2008 and 2010.</p>\n<p>The path to upsetting the Aggies will begin with the Gauchos’ ability to protect the ball. UCSB is coming off a season-high 26 turnovers in its loss to Long Beach State, in which it was outscored 35-13 in points off turnovers. It was the sixth time this season the Gauchos turned the ball over 20-plus times, but the first since Dec. 19 in their win over Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi.</p>\n<p>While the defensive pressure of opposing teams must be accredited, oftentimes UCSB’s turnover troubles result from self-inflicted mistakes such as forcing passes in the lane and paint that result in steals, wasted possessions that go out of bounds or the mishandling of passes.</p>\n<p>During the team’s 1-4 standing in its last five games, UCSB has continuously struggled with its three-point shooting. Over the span of games, Santa Barbara has accumulated a 21.4 average from behind three-point line, finishing with an 11.8 percentage in its last game after a 2-for-17 finish from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos could use an improved three-point shooting performance from redshirt sophomore Sarah Porter.</p>\n<p>Despite shooting a Big West fifth-best 39.2 percent from three-point land and having the third-most made three-pointers in the conference at 56, Porter has only shown glimpses of her once consistent long range shooting.</p>\n<p>She began the Gauchos’ five game slide with a disturbing zero points and 0-of-8 shooting outing and hasn’t been able to make much progress since. Currently shooting 25.6 percent from behind the perimeter, Porter has only managed to achieve double figures in scoring twice, and she is coming off her second-lowest career total of two points.</p>\n<p>Still, the team’s go-to scorer remains a primary option as her 56 made three-pointers are tied for sixth-most in a single season in UCSB women’s basketball history. If Porter can manage to get the three ball to fall, it could be very beneficial as the Gauchos are 6-1 during conference play when she makes three or more three-point baskets.</p>\n<p>UCSB will need to capitalize upon any scoring opportunity it can get as it prepares to face arguably the most dynamic team in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UC Davis, who last won a Big West title in 2011, has made itself one of the conference’s few teams favored to lock up the No. 1 seed and possibly win the Big West Tournament. Another win could have major implications as the 2010-11 season also was UCD’s last 20-win season.</p>\n<p>The Aggies lead in just about every imaginable statistical category with outstanding averages in points per game (69.8), points allowed per game (60), field goal percentage (44.3), three-point percentage (35.3), defensive three-point percentage (27.5), defensive field goal percentage (35.3), turnovers committed per game (13.6) and assists per game (16.8).</p>\n<p>Davis is one of three Big West teams this season to hand UCSB its largest deficit in a loss of 14 points. The two teams last met on Feb. 4 when redshirt sophomore forward Morgan Bertsch tied her career-high of 27 points to lead the Aggies to a 62-48 victory.</p>\n<p>Bertsch currently ranks third in points per game and fourth in field goal percentage in the Big West with averages of 16.7 and 52.7, respectively. Three of her eight 20-point games this season have occurred in the Aggies’ past four games.</p>\n<p>As the team’s top scorer, Bertsch is able to score in the paint and stretch the floor with her midrange shooting, benefiting from behind the perimeter is the junior duo of forwards Pele Gianotti and Dani Nafekh.</p>\n<p>The pair of long range sharpshooters complete Davis’ trio of double figure scorers with Nafekh averaging 11.3 PPG and Gianotti at 10.6 PPG. Both are within the top five in the Big West in three-point percentage, as Nafekh sits atop the conference at 46.5 percent while Gianotti is sixth at 38.5 percent.</p>\n<p>UCSB held UC Davis to a 12.5 three-point percentage earlier in the month on 2-of-16 shooting.</p>\n<p>Upsetting the Aggies at home will be a difficult task as they have won 14 of their last 17 home games. Most notably, they have not trailed in a game since the second quarter of their win over Cal State Fullerton back on Jan. 28.</p>\n<p>Despite facing arguably the best team in the Big West, UCSB must focus on its defensive approach as that will help it produce on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>UCSB and UC Davis will tip off at 2 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 25 at the Pavilion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of February 23rd, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75914\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-basketball-looking-to-capitalize-on-upset-opportunity-face-bw-leader-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75914\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-basketball-looking-to-capitalize-on-upset-opportunity-face-bw-leader-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-basketball-looking-to-capitalize-on-upset-opportunity-face-bw-leader-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-basketball-looking-to-capitalize-on-upset-opportunity-face-bw-leader-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/womens-basketball-looking-to-capitalize-on-upset-opportunity-face-bw-leader-uc-davis/","id":251,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[250,249,248],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White","biography":"Not available","articles":[163,251,282,290,292,293,300,302,311,312,314,315,316,327,328,329,337,338,340,341,343,345,347,349,350,351,353,356,357,361,362,363,364,365,368,370,372,373,375,376,379,381,382,385,387,389,391,392,393,395,396,398,401,406,407,408,414,426,447,452,453,455,468,471,487,488,492,504,506,507,513,517,528,529,530,583,585,601,674,975,1208,1363,1415,1428,1430,1443,1473,1775,1776,1777,1872,1873,1881,1886,1889,1890,1893,1908,1911,1914,1971,1974,1984,1993,2005,2020,2021,2025,2849,3280,3283,3284,3290,3298,3299,3304,3306,3310,3322,3323,3325,3338,3381,4102,4954,4981,4988,4991,4996,5041,5044,5049,5055,5070,5071,5072,5073,5074,5075,5076,5077,5079,5080,5081,5082,5088,5089,5097,5098,5120,5121,5151,5152,5317,5340,5342,5343,5345,5347,5349,5365,5367,5368,5369,5371,5384,5387,5388,5389,5390,5391,5393,5394,5395,5401,5479,5509,5543],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Men’s Basketball Looking to Hold On to Slim Postseason Chance Entering Final Home Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MensBasketballChristinaDeMarzo_2-2-17_2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MensBasketballChristinaDeMarzo_2-2-17_2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Currently at the bottom of the Big West standings, the UCSB men's basketball team is on its last leg of hope to grab the eighth seed in the Big West tournament.

Not only has he scored the brunt of the Gaucho baskets since Vincent has been out, but he has played with a noticeable energy and fierceness to the last minute of the game.</p>\n<p>In his most recent game against Long Beach State, he only put seven on the board, but before that he scored 16 points in the victory against Hawaii last Thursday and has been an essential asset to the team, starting the last five games averaging 12.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>Despite only scoring four points, Gaucho freshman guard Christian Terrell had a solid game against LBSU as he tied his career-high grabbing nine rebounds. Although Terrell has had some hesitation in the past when it comes to taking the shot, he has started in six conference games so far and continues to improve.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Highlanders’ field goal percentage is 42.1 while the Gauchos are barely hanging onto their 37.1, a league-worst mark. An unfortunate recurring theme for the UCSB team is their inability to shoot with accuracy. The trouble is not getting to the basket but getting the ball in the basket.</p>\n<p>Aside from Hart and team leader senior guard Eric Childress, freshman guard Max Heidegger is an explosive player that drives hard and puts points on the board, yet with so many top players unable to participate, the Gauchos are suffering as clearly demonstrated in their record.</p>\n<p>One area that Santa Barbara does excel in, at least ever so slightly better than UCR, is rebounding. The Gauchos are averaging 36.6 per game compared to the Highlanders’ 34.8, showcasing how they are getting in there and grabbing the ball off both offensive and defensive glass.</p>\n<p>UCR has a fantastic free throw percentage of nearly 73 percent on the season compared to the Gaucho percentage of 64 percent. In their most recent game, UCSB had 17 personal fouls called on them; against a team as accurate as Riverside, the Gauchos will have to play smart and not commit as many fouls, especially on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>For Childress, Thursday will obviously be an emotional night as it will be his final game wearing a Gaucho uniform in the Thunderdome. The senior will look to cap off his home career in the right way improving upon his team-high 8.5 points per game, 3.5 assists per game and 2.2 steals per game, also a Big West best.</p>\n<p>The co-captain of the team alongside Vincent, Childress has played on some great Gaucho teams, and although this wasn’t the ending he expected, a win could mitigate some of the damage done to his senior season.</p>\n<p>As the season winds to a close, all teams are trying to bring in as many wins as possible heading into the Big West tournament. As this will be each team’s second to last game, expect both teams to bring all they have got to the court.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Gaucho and UCR Highlander game will take place this Thursday, Feb. 23, in the Thunderdome at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 23rd, 2017’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75874\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/75874/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75874\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/75874/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/75874/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/75874/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/75874/","id":248,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[247,246,245],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Starts Season With Three Matches at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s tennis team kicks off its regular season with a three-game home stand this weekend, playing against Northern Arizona on Friday, San Jose State on Saturday and the University of San ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s tennis team kicks off its regular season with a three-game home stand this weekend, playing against Northern Arizona on Friday, San Jose State on Saturday and the University of San Francisco on Sunday.</p>\n<p>The match against Northern Arizona will be the first of the regular season, as well as the first under new Head Coach Simon Thibodeau.

Are we confident enough to beat them? And if we are, then it’s definitely going to be a great match.”</p>\n<p>While Davis usually pushes his players to their limits in practice to ensure that he has one of the most fit teams in the nation, the preparation for this week’s match has yielded a much lighter workload for the team.</p>\n<p>“Fitness has never been an issuer for us,” Scott said. “The practices last week were really tough so we’ve been taking it easy resting the bodies, making sure no injuries come into play for tomorrow. Just a lot of mental preparation and getting pumped up.”</p>\n<p>In a warm Los Angeles climate, and being on the road against a much tougher opponent than they faced last week, UCSB will surely be looking to utilize one of their greatest advantages on the court in their excellent conditioning.</p>\n<p>The match will begin at 1:30 p.m. at the Los Angeles Tennis Center.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 23rd, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49589\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/ucsb-looks-to-upset-ucla-on-the-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49589\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/ucsb-looks-to-upset-ucla-on-the-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/ucsb-looks-to-upset-ucla-on-the-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/ucsb-looks-to-upset-ucla-on-the-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-23/ucsb-looks-to-upset-ucla-on-the-road/","id":249,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[248,247,246],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
