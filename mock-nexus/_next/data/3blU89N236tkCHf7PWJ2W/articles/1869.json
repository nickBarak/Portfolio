the reports of sexual violence in Isla Vista. <em>Devin Ralston / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Task Force for Safer Social Events in Isla Vista heard from the Interfraternity Council (IFC) President Jason Stone about recent “risk management practices” implemented at fraternity events and from the Office of Student Life (OSL) about the way the university communicates with students about incidents that occur in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an </span><a href=\"https://t.e2ma.net/message/c5to3e/4at55p\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">email</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sent out to students on Oct. 30 that first introduced the task force, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Assistant Vice Chancellor and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead wrote that the task force would come up with a series of recommendations to improve safety at social events in I.V. to present to the university by the end of Winter Quarter 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Task Force recommendations will focus on registered campus organizations, fraternities and sororities, athletic groups/teams, and other social events in Isla Vista,” the two wrote in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Representatives at Monday’s meeting ranged from the Alcohol and Drug Program, the OSL, the Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education Office, the Title IX office, the UCSB Police Department and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol, in addition to students from Students Against Sexual Assault, Intersectional Feminists, the Graduate Student Association, IFC and the Collegiate Panhellenic Council (CPC). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn began the meeting by reviewing the task force’s first meeting in Fall Quarter 2019, during which the task force determined what exactly it wanted to address in its recommendations to the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone then presented a series of <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-04/interfraternity-council-bans-hard-alcohol-implements-sober-party-monitors-in-sweeping-changes/\">regulations</a> that the IFC implemented at the beginning of winter quarter on all social events that any IFC fraternity hosts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The regulations include the addition of sober hosts and sober stations at all IFC social events as well as a ban on hard alcohol. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sober hosts are designated members of the hosting organization who are required by the IFC to maintain their sobriety throughout an IFC social event and serve as a resource for attendees who run into any problems, Stone said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sober hosts are required to wear neon vests, similar to construction workers, so they can easily be identified. The IFC is requiring three sober hosts for the first 50 people at an IFC event, and an additional sober host for every additional 25 people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve made clear and we’ve put into place strategies for making those people wholly identifiable,” Stone said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s also constant across our IFC organizations. So for any guests who may go to multiple events hosted by multiple different organizations, they can identify those people typically in the exact same way,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone said that the IFC had recently purchased breathalyzers and have been dropping in on IFC events to breathalyze the sober hosts to ensure they’re being held accountable. If a sober host is found to have a blood alcohol level higher than 0.00, Stone said the event would be shut down immediately.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the sober hosts, the IFC is working on setting up sober stations at all events, where attendees can get water, or find a sober host if they need one. The stations will be in a centralized location and easy to find, Stone said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the sober hosts and stations required at IFC events, Stone said the council has adopted a policy from its national organization, the North American Interfraternity Council (NIC), that bans hard alcohol at all UCSB IFC events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, all alcohol at events is single container, CPC President Ally van Dorsten said, which is meant to address the issue of the use of date-rape drugs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s no alcohol that is not single-container,” van Dorsten said. “So there’s not a lot of opportunity at these events for people to be drugging, because it’s all closed, individual, single-container alcohol that is being served to people of age.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The task force also discussed how the university communicates with students when incidents occur in I.V. Miles Ashlock, acting associate dean and director of the OSL, said that communication is often dependent on concerns about immediate safety.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlock and others said the university was trying to create a set of templates for emergency communication so that whoever was responsible for sending them out wouldn’t have to make any subjective decisions regarding the message. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the meeting wrapped up, Ashlock asked the task force members to consider what they want from the university during “critical incidents,” and said the task force’s first steps are to define what they consider to be a “critical incident.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think there’s an opportunity with this task force convened with so many different perspectives to clarify, put down on paper, ‘What are the things that students have an expectation or a want, particularly, to hear about?’” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And then from that clarification of what consists of critical incidents, also thinking through… the sorts of language, the sorts of communication methods that we use, the length of those communications, the details repeated or not, whether or not students can opt out of those communications,” Ashlock added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a lot that we could explore.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The task force plans to have its next meeting on Friday, Feb. 28, from 3:00-4:30 p.m. at the Flying A Studios Room in the University Center. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

As of the 2010 census, more than 23,000 people live in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the deadline has passed to register for the March primary, the work is hardly over for Marsano, with the November 2020 election right around the corner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I anticipate that this upcoming presidential election will be busy. Of course, we will only have three and a half weeks to register students because they come back the last week of September and the deadline to register next year is October 19 and elections are November 3,” Marsano said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She attributed UCSB’s high voter registration percentage to a greater push for in-person registration, opposed to online registration as most other universities do.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB’s notorious about preferring face-to-face voter registration rather than online,” Marsano explained. “You would get a card and if you didn’t do something with that card and mail it back, you would not be really registered. So the follow-up was more complicated.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Education is another important factor in the voting process that many of the organizations take on in addition to registration, according to Christian Ornelas, the Executive Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Ornelas noted that the EVPLA office attempted to clear misinformation about voting after Rock the Vote SB’s national organization declared the local chapter illegitimate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After their first big efforts for registry during welcome week at campus dorms, Natalie Bastawros, vice president of Campus Democrats, said the VRVC went to great lengths to make sure everyone had the opportunity to register to vote in Santa Barbara County.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The goal of the club is to try to make it easier for people to register,” Bastawros said about the VRVC. She explained that if an individual registers online within Santa Barbara County, and they miss a box or two, the county sends you back an additional form in the mail for you to fill out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus Democrats table Monday through Friday all of winter quarter for voter registration, according to Bastawros, and have also increased door-to-door canvassing in I.V. and at university housing. An app called PDI allows Campus Democrats to access public voter registration information, allows canvassers to target locations with low registration, according to Bastawros.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Organizations pushing for voter registration often face resistance from students who are already registered, but in a different county. A big part of tabling is educating students how local policies can have significant impact,” Bastawros said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It might not seem like that on the national level, but for the local elections here as students live, whether you live on campus or in I.V., it’s really, really important to register here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the Feb. 18 voter registration deadline, Campus Democrats tabled at ten different locations on campus up until the 6 p.m. deadline. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. is a “swing district” that determines the 3rd District County Supervisor vote, Bastawros said. While the other districts are fairly unwavering, the 3rd District, which encompasses I.V. and parts of northern and central Santa Barbara County, is often the deciding vote between the more rural 4th and 5th districts and the smaller but more populated 1st and 2nd districts that include Santa Barbara and Carpinteria.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Both Shofet and Shahaf are working together to address food insecurity, specifically for those who only eat halal and kosher food, by providing them with food that fits their dietary needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Halal and Kosher Program creates weekly grocery bags for low income students who follow Halal and Kosher dietary restrictions,” Shahaf said in an email. “Every week the bags have a breakfast option, a set of instant lunches, potential snacks, and a dinner option.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Shahaf, the program is currently funded through the UCSB Food Security &amp; Basic Needs Taskforce; it also partners with the Isla Vista Food Cooperative (I.V. Co-op), which provides the food at discount prices and assists with transportation. Shahaf and the I.V. Co-op communicate through weekly emails and occasional meetings to plan what food items will be in the bags for that week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know how we would be running this program without the Isla Vista Food Cooperative’s charitable nature and the discounted pricing they offer us,” Shahaf stated. “Their amazing team, as well as the food bank employees, help me load all the food into a van headed to the food bank, where we assemble and place the bags.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shahaf explained that the Associated Students Food Bank also plays an integral role in the program running smoothly, as its employees assist in picking up bulk orders, assemble bags and help sign in Halal and Kosher Program participants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shahaf said she constantly communicates with leading members of campus organizations such as the I.V. Co-op and the UCSB Sustainability to ensure everything is running smoothly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I also check in and receive feedback from other leaders on campus like the Middle Eastern Resource Center, and the Muslim Student Association for new ideas and to see how we can improve or better serve our joint Muslim and Jewish Community,” Shahaf added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But to Shahaf, the importance of the program extends beyond its day-to-day operations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Keeping Kosher is how I keep my ancestors and my cultural past close to my heart, and it is one of the only aspects of Judaism in my daily life,” she explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I imagine it is similar for many Muslim students who keep Halal, as they are reminded of Islamic persecution around the world. I want to make it possible for every Jewish and Muslim student to keep their religious dietary restrictions, and to feel seen and supported by this campus.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this

Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event featured three UCSB faculty and staff members who presented about the origins of the Wuhan coronavirus (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2019-nCoV) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— Ali Javanbakht, the interim Student Health Service executive director and medical director; Holly Smith, administrative nursing supervisor and infection control coordinator; and Carolina Arias, a professor in the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. T</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he three addressed misconceptions surrounding the virus before answering questions</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from an audience packed with students and community members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pan Asian Network, in a statement passed out to attendees, emphasized to community members that “coronavirus doesn’t give you an excuse to be a dick to Asian people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement also described the racism and xenophobia that many UCSB students said they have experienced since the coronavirus outbreak, including “a concerning lack of empathy and solidarity with our campus’s Chinese students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vidhisha Mahesh, a second-year psychological and brain sciences major and member of the Pan Asian Network, talked about her frustration with having to educate people perpetuating racist and xenophobic steryotypes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">China has received criticism for its original handling of the outbreak and the lack of information put out to the public, the New York Times reported. Chinese officials put the latest death toll at 563, and the number of confirmed cases at 28,018; there have been 12 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the U.S. as of Feb. 5. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The U.S. has put in place screening and quarantine measures for those traveling from possibly infected areas, according to the New York Times. The UC system is following a nationwide protocol in screening patients who have symptoms of the virus and have been outside the country in the last 14 days, the New York Times said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht was quick to reassure teach-in attendees that “the risk to our campus community is pretty low.” The virus has an incubation period of roughly 5-14 days, and “for most people on campus, those who have travelled to or possibly been near an infected person are well out of the incubation period, meaning they did not get infected,” he elaborated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should someone from UCSB be diagnosed with the virus, the school would defer to Santa Barbara County Public Health Department and is still “remaining diligent” in helping students stay safe, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith went on to detail prevention methods for the coronavirus, which are the same as those recommended for the flu or common cold. “Do the things you should be doing all day every day anyways,” Smith recommended to students while passing around hand sanitizers to the audience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hand sanitizer, a full squirt, even your thumbs … always wash your hands, [and] if you’re sick, limit contact with others. Eat well, get rest,” she reminded the audience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is not necessary for those who have not been infected to wear masks,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pan Asian Network statement also detailed the ridicule that some students have received while wearing masks to help them feel more protected on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students feel the need to laugh and point at us for wearing N95 masks that are scientifically proven to help prevent the spread of disease,” the statement said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katie, a community member who declined to state her last name and who described herself as “deeply involved with Chinese students on campus,” discussed the cultural divide between China and the U.S. during the Q&amp;A portion of the event and the confusion that international students might feel.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If everything they’re hearing back home is that roads are blocked off, everyone is wearing masks, people are being asked to not ride mass transit — everything they’re hearing from the community they trust is that this is a huge deal. And then they come here, and the qualified medical professionals are just telling them, basically, to wash their hands,” she explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comments and questions addressed to the three faculty and staff members made it clear that many students were still feeling anxiety and concern not only around the coronavirus but also around the underlying racist sentiments that have penetrated most discussions around it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This isn’t just affecting a subgroup of people who have the virus, but the entire Asian community on campus,” Vince Matthew Feliciano, a Pan Asian board member, explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To people who might already feel like they don’t belong, this is just emphasizing the divide between who is Asian and who isn’t.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 6, 2020 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.
