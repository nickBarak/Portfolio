Sophomore leftfielder Kori Nishitomi hit 2-4 with two runs and one RBI while freshman designated player Alexis Gonzalez was 2-2 on the day with one run and two RBI. In addition, junior centerfielder Dani Gilmore contributed two runs on 3-4 hitting and senior first baseman Hannah Bouska added two runs on 3-3 hitting.</p>\n<p>Entering the third inning, Oregon St. found its stride offensively, scoring at least one run in every remaining inning.</p>\n<p>In the third, the Beavers strung together four hits to score three runs. The following inning, freshman catcher Kylie Padilla crossed home plate on a wild pitch. Oregon St. continued to play small ball to score two runs in both the fifth and sixth innings.</p>\n<p>UCSB did muster one run in the sixth inning, but overall couldn’t string hits together to find the needed runs. The Gauchos were 2-12 hitting with runners on base while the Beavers were 7-20.</p>\n<p>The Beavers were also 14-22 in advancing runners compared to just 3-13 for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>With three games in Oregon done, UCSB will try to snap its losing skid this weekend when it returns home to play Cal Poly in a blue-green rivalry match-up.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs come to Campus Diamond tied for third place in the Big West. They hold a 20-12 overall record and are 2-1 in conference play.</p>\n<p>So far this season, Cal Poly stands as one of the best defensive teams in the Big West. It leads the league in hits allowed, runs and ERA, all by a large margin.</p>\n<p>Leading the Mustangs’ defense is Sierra Hyland. The freshman pitcher won her fourth Big West Pitcher of the Week award earlier this week, a team record. Hyland currently ranks sixth in the nation in strikeouts with 180 on the year. Her ERA of 1.66 also tops the Big West.</p>\n<p>For a series victory this week for UCSB, the Gauchos will need to improve on stringing hits together and finding consistency on offense.</p>\n<p>First pitch of the three game series is set for noon on Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 3rd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s the blue-green rivalry and the second week of conference, and I’m mostly proud of how they came back after we basically got it handed to us the first game,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “They made the choice to come back, compete and fight back.”</p>\n<p>With the series victory, the Gauchos improve to 23-16 overall and 3-3 in conference. The Mustangs drop to 21-14 overall and 3-3 in the Big West. Both Santa Barbara and Cal Poly move into a three-way tie for fourth place in the conference standings, along with Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>In yesterday’s rubber match, UCSB earned the 2-1 victory thanks to two runs from freshman leftfielder Kristen Clark. In a game that featured just seven hits combined from both teams, the Gauchos crossed home plate first in the opening inning when sophomore catcher MeShalon Moore hit a sacrifice fly to bring Clark home.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly responded in the second inning, but Santa Barbara broke the stalemate in the fifth inning to score the winning run. Clark advanced to first base on a fielder’s choice to third base before stealing second. Then, junior right fielder DeJanee Moore floated the ball just over the head of the first baseman to score Clark and give UCSB the series victory 2-1.</p>\n<p>“We had better quality at bats,” Galicinao said. “We only had three hits, so it was a matter of working longer at bats and forcing the pitcher to throw more pitches. We had a few walks and got a couple key hits, and that’s what it takes in our game sometimes. We were able to find a way to push them across. It was enough.”</p>\n<p>Junior pitcher Shelby Wisdom earned the victory in the circle, improving to 11-11 on the year. While reigning Big West Pitcher of the Week freshman Sierra Hyland suffered the loss, dropping to 18-6, she gave up just three hits and struck out eight in her six innings of play.</p>\n<p>“[Hyland’s] good. Obviously she’s been doing a really good job,” Galicinao said. “As much as you don’t like having [her] against you, it’s also exciting to see a talent like that come through the ranks.”</p>\n<p>In game two of Saturday’s double-header, UCSB snapped a six-game losing streak that continued through game one, winning 2-0.</p>\n<p>Despite being outhit 7-5, the Gauchos took advantage of their opportunities offensively. Both runs came in the fourth inning due to poor defense from Cal Poly. MeShalon Moore walked, senior second baseman Kathryn Pilpil was hit by a pitch and senior first baseman Lauren Boser reached first base on an error.</p>\n<p>As a result, the Mustangs made a pitching change, but it did not matter. Freshman shortstop Emily Brucelas was walked to score Moore in the winning run of the day and sophomore leftfielder Jessica Tetzlaff singled, scoring Pilpil to secure the victory.</p>\n<p>Clark led the offense for Santa Barbara, hitting 3-4. Meanwhile, Wisdom earned the win in the circle, earning the shutout while striking out three.</p>\n<p>“[Saturday’s win] was really big,” Clark said. “We were feeling a little bit down and frustrated, but to come out and shut them down was really good for us and I think it carried into [yesterday] too.”</p>\n<p>Game one on Saturday was a completely different story. Falling 14-1, UCSB failed to contain a Cal Poly squad known more for its defense than its offense.</p>\n<p>Eleven different Mustangs scored runs as Cal Poly scored at least one run in six of the seven innings, capped off by six runs in the seventh.

After putting two runs on the board in the first inning, the Ducks scored three runs off of two singles and four walks. They then capped off the inning with a grand slam from senior first baseman Kailee Cuico.</p>\n<p>Down by a large margin in the third, Wisdom homered with two outs to left field, scoring Pilpil and Clark.</p>\n<p>With the deficit still at six runs, UCSB’s comeback came up short. Both teams scored one more run, the Ducks in the sixth inning and the Gauchos in the seventh, but Santa Barbara couldn’t find the offense to avoid its second loss of the day 10-4.</p>\n<p>After falling behind early, UCSB outplayed Oregon the second half of the game. Sophomore pitcher Ashley Ludlow anchored the Gauchos defensively, giving up just two hits and striking out four in her 4.2 innings of play. On the offensive end, Santa Barbara outscored Oregon 4-1 after the second inning.</p>\n<p>Offensively, six different players scored for the Ducks. Leading Oregon were Ceo and Cuico. Ceo hit 2-2 with two runs and one RBI while Cuico recorded one run and five RBI on 2-2 hitting.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continues its break from conference play and road trip in Oregon tomorrow when it travels to take on Oregon State. First pitch is set for noon at the OSU Softball Complex.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of April 2nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Anna Kodelashvili of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54540\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/ucsb-defeated-twice-by-no-16-oregon/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54540\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/ucsb-defeated-twice-by-no-16-oregon/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/ucsb-defeated-twice-by-no-16-oregon/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/ucsb-defeated-twice-by-no-16-oregon/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/ucsb-defeated-twice-by-no-16-oregon/","id":1053,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1052,1051,1050],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Four-Match Home Stretch Kicks Off Versus Portland","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WTennisVS.DAVIS-JennyLuo-02142016-04-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WTennisVS.DAVIS-JennyLuo-02142016-04-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After having last week's road trip cancelled due to the rainy weather, the UCSB women's tennis team will attempt to capitalize on its home court with matches versus Portland at noon and Harvard on Sat...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Now who said it never rains in California?

They have beaten notable teams such as, No. 61 Brown and fellow Big West opponent UC Irvine by a score of 4-1.</p>\n<p>Last time these two teams met, back in the 2012-2013 season, UCSB came out on top in a convincing fashion as they made quick work of the Pilots 6-1. It has been three years since then, and there is not a single gaucho that took part in those matches. Unlike Portland who has four returning players hoping to vindicate its losses.</p>\n<p>“They have a stronger team now, they beat Boise State and Irvine, two teams we will have to face in the upcoming month,” said UCSB Head Coach Simon Thibodeau. “We are taking them very seriously, we will have to show up, and we haven’t played a match since Hawaii so it will be challenging, but we are ready”.</p>\n<p>One of those Players is senior Maja Mladenovic. She has won her last three single’s match-ups but has not been able to find the right chemistry with any of her teammates. In doubles competition she is 0-9 this season in at least three different combinations.</p>\n<p>Mladenovic’s fellow senior Lucia Butkovska has been leading her team in the wins category. Her production in the singles category is unmatched by any of her fellow pilots. She is six for two winning her last six singles matches. In doubles play she also leads the team in winning percentage, as she is .500 as a pair winning four out of eight matches.</p>\n<p>UCSB has plenty of options in its arsenal as well. Aside from the dominant duo sophomore Palina Dubavets and junior Stefani Stojic that currently rank at No. 19 in doubles, the Gauchos have plenty of other stand outs like sophomores Lou Adler and Amanda Atanasson. As a doubles pair they are undoubtedly the second best combo for Santa Barbara as they have a 10-6 record in doubles winning their last two.</p>\n<p>As individuals they both have been just as proficient. Adler has one of the best individual records on the team with twelve wins and seven losses in single’s competition winning here last three, and six of her last ten. She has demonstrated a presence on the team with her consistency in the the number two position as she is currently 4-1 at the two spot. Atanasson is 9-7 overall in singles and has won her last two matchups.</p>\n<p>“They have good chemistry together. Different styles that compliment each other, friends on and off the court. Lou plays on the baseline, while Amanda likes to play by the net.” Coach Thibodeau explained. “I Would like them to step it up when they play at the two to get tougher wins there. And in singles they have been solid with winning records “</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have just a few more games left before they jump right back into Big West Conference match ups to end the 2016 season and they will need to utilize every game afforded to them to continue to improve and experiment, especially after missing out three games because of rain.</p>\n<p>UCSB will begin play Thursday at Noon at the Rec Cen courts against Portland.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68989\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsbs-four-match-home-stretch-kicks-off-versus-portland/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68989\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsbs-four-match-home-stretch-kicks-off-versus-portland/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsbs-four-match-home-stretch-kicks-off-versus-portland/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsbs-four-match-home-stretch-kicks-off-versus-portland/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsbs-four-match-home-stretch-kicks-off-versus-portland/","id":1052,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[1051,1050,1049],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
