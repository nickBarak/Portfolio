Students also criticized Napolitano’s proposed state budget revisal to freeze tuition until the 2017–2018 school year. At the conclusion of the event, attendees wrote individual petitions to Governor Jerry Brown and the UC Board of Regents voicing their frustration on tuition increases.</p>\n<p>EVPSA Office Fellow and first-year Asian American studies and political science double major Akshaya Natarajan said the event aimed to “rally voices” and communicate that the suggested tuition freezes are not a sufficient solution to the increasing cost of tuition.</p>\n<p>​”The message for this event says that we are still fucked because there are a lot of problems, such as the eight percent increase of out of state tuition and increases for graduate school tuition as well,” Natarajan said. “Tuition freeze is not enough because it will fuck us over in the future if it is not taken care of.”</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and art double major Joseline Garcia said We’re fUCked informs students of how tuition hikes affect them.</p>\n<p>“This will get students angry because you need an education no matter where you go,” Garcia said. “Your skin color, background, lifestyle, culture, ideals and majors do not matter because this tuition hike will definitely affect you in some way.”</p>\n<p>​Natarajan said tuition hikes should receive more “pressing exposure” from the media.</p>\n<p>“This is why we invited plenty of news sources to report on this specific event today,” Natarajan said. “As long as we have more momentum and more media, then I deeply believe this will influence more change for the betterment of all students. It is not enough to simply oppose the tuition hikes.”</p>\n<p>​Natarajan said students should be angered by the tuition hikes and continue protesting in order to affect change.</p>\n<p>“Defunding of the UC is something that anyone should be angered about because, realistically, we are paying more and more for our public education, even though the state should be funding us,” Natarajan said. “We have angered students all across the state.”</p>\n<p>​Tuition increases contribute to financial challenges for students now and will continue to do so in their futures, according to EVPSA and fourth-year political science and film &amp; media studies double major Melvin Singh.</p>\n<p>“I am starting to believe that school is only preparing me to deal with a bad economy which is full of debts such as the tuition hikes which are fucking us all,” Singh said. “This is why we are still fucked and angry.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology and black studies double major Mohsin Mirza said temporary tuition freezes are comparable to open wounds.</p>\n<p>“If you take a knife and stick it six inches deep into a man’s body and pull it out, it is not progress,” Mirza said. “Progress is healing that wound completely. The same thing is happening now because the UC system is pulling the knife out instead of healing the students’ wounds.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said Brown and Napolitano do not consider students’ perspectives when raising tuition.</p>\n<p>“I think Governor Brown and President Napolitano think it is a good idea to raise tuition because they are not students,” Mirza said. “This is not their university. This is our university.”</p>\n<p>A.S. off-campus senator and second-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said unaffordable tuition restricts her housing situation.</p>\n<p>“I live in a one bedroom apartment in Isla Vista,” Dela Cruz said. “I have five roommates who live with me, not because they want to, but because the tuition costs leave them with no other viable option.”</p>\n<p>Community affairs student engagement and advocacy advisor and graduate student Aaron Jones said the UC system is “undermining” the students’ efforts.</p>\n<p>“I am utterly displeased with conversations about the tuition hikes,” Jones said. “I am utterly displeased because there are thousands of students who are trying their damn best to be the best students they can be.”</p>\n<p>Jones said while graduate students work long hours, they still face student debt following graduating.</p>\n<p>“As graduate students and TA’s, we put in hours of hard work by grading hundreds of papers and studying for our own classes,” Jones said. “In turn, we receive debt as a reward which only causes sorrow and leads people to have less confidence in the education system.”</p>\n<p>According to Garcia, tuition hikes have a greater impact on students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>\n<p>“I think it is ridiculous to raise tuition because this will only cause people to be less educated in society,” Garcia said. “It puts people of color at risk of not receiving an education and makes society unreliable as a whole. We need more educated people to make life more efficient.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63510\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/were-fucked-campaign-ends-with-rally/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63510\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/were-fucked-campaign-ends-with-rally/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/were-fucked-campaign-ends-with-rally/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/were-fucked-campaign-ends-with-rally/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-18/were-fucked-campaign-ends-with-rally/","id":2755,"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva"},"related":[2754,2753,2752],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":159,"name":"William Leiva","biography":"Not available","articles":[2755,2842,2861,2873,2882,2911,2921,2929,2956,4704,4725,4746,4753,4762,4784],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

It also includes $436 million over the next three years to reduce UC’s pension liability. A tuition freeze would be contingent on the UC Board of Regents lowing its pension ceiling and establishing benefit plans for certain employees in accordance with the 2013 Public Employees Pension Reform Act.</p>\n<p>UC plans to further increase revenue by raising the Student Service Fee by five percent annually and, if approved at the May 21 meeting of the UC Board of Regents, increase out-of-state tuition by eight percent annually. The budget will go to the state legislature for consideration.</p>\n<p>Napolitano said Brown has acknowledged the importance of UC education by agreeing to the budget revisions.</p>\n<p>“With this agreement, the Governor has recognized the need to reinvest in UC as well as the imperative to provide students, their families and the University with a reliable way to budget for the cost of a UC education,” Napolitano said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Communications Director for the A.S. Lobby Corps and first-year art history major Lacy Wright said she supports the proposed increase to the Student Services Fee, because UCSB Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) is in need of better funding.</p>\n<p>“C.A.P.S. works so incredibly hard to help all the students seeking counseling, but just doesn’t have the funds,” Wright said. “Students often have to wait weeks to see a counselor, and this wait could be drastically shortened with the increase in funds.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology and black studies major Mohsin Mirza said while Student Service Fee provides important services, students should not have to bear so much of the financial burden.</p>\n<p>“The services fee will go to programs that are very helpful and necessary, like increased funding for mental health services so C.A.P.S. can hire more practitioners,” Mirza said. “It’s incredibly important, but unfortunate that, once again, it’ll be students who, across the state, already are struggling financially, who will have to be picking up the tab rather than the state.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63462\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63462\" data-attachment-id=\"63462\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/budgetproposal-to-freeze-in-state-tuition-provide-more-program-funds/brown_budget-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,399\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1416399737\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Brown_Budget-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63462\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?resize=600%2C399\" alt=\"Daily Nexus File Photo\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63462\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Daily Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p>Mirza said the proposed increase to out-of-state tuition is “unfortunate” because it will exclude many people of lower economic classes from attending a UC.</p>\n<p>“Out-of-state students are already extremely financially burdened, and I worry that this latest increase will mean that only the wealthiest out-of-state students will continue to afford to be here.”</p>\n<p>According to Mirza, Prop 13 reform and UC budget transparency can help eliminate future “tuition battles.”</p>\n<p>“These are the big changes we need, and the only way I can foresee that happening is if we can build a stronger student movement over the next two years,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Napolitano said the budget revision will not accommodate UC’s desired increase in enrollment.</p>\n<p>“It does not fund California student enrollment growth — so our work is not done,” Napolitano said in a statement.</p>\n<p>According to a statement from the UC Students Association (UCSA), UCSA President Jefferson Kuoch-Seng said while May Revise is an important step, students should continue pushing for lower tuition.</p>\n<p>“Today’s announcement contains promising news for California UC undergraduates,” Kuoch-Seng said. “However, students will continue our direct advocacy in Sacramento and build broad support across California within and beyond our campuses.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said he is “cautiously optimistic” UC will use new state funding efficiently.</p>\n<p>“The UC has a history of mismanaging funds, it was a key reason as to why Prop 30 failed to have the impact we had hoped it would,” Mirza said. “I know students will be doing their best to hold them accountable.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Yang’s office from Wednesday afternoon to Thursday morning to demand specific policies to improve the handling of sexual assault cases, concluding the night with a signature from Yang ensuring the enactment of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V2Y7OcloAaEc8gA8S8b-gpMDI-DGq6lUIW-uF5L_Ico/edit?usp=sharing\">13 policies</a> that favor survivors.</p>\n<p>Yang, along with Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Mary Jacob and Senior Associate Dean for Student Life Debbie Fleming, agreed to consider immediate suspension for perpetrators, implement a minimum sanction for sexual assault crimes and immediately remove perpetrators from university-owned housing. In addition, administrators decided to take steps to increase staff diversity and implement faculty training on cultural and identity sensitivity. Yang committed to cover full travel expenses for Melgoza, Weyrick and Vasquez to speak at the May 20 UC Regents meeting in San Francisco and approved eight additional demands. Melgoza, Weyrick and Vasquez will meet with Yang again on Monday to present a budget and discuss details and execution of the agreements.</p>\n<p>Second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major Melgoza said Yang and administrators met the demands with only a few changes to the wording.</p>\n<p>“All the demands are going to be in print … and the whole school’s going to see them,” Melgoza said. “We made a few adjustments, but just on the wording and on the jargon of everything. They were pretty concrete demands, and they met them.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said she looks forward to attending UCSB as an ordinary student knowing there will now be policies to sanction sexual assault offenders and provide support to victims.</p>\n<p>“It’s been such a part of my life throughout my college experience that I don’t remember what it’s like to be a normal college student,” Melgoza said. “I’m excited to see what that will look like, where I will be fighting for other students.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s been such a part of my life throughout my college experience that I don’t remember what it’s like to be a normal college student. I’m excited to see what that will look like.           – Alejandra Melgoza</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gaucho Consent Co-Chair and second-year sociology major Weyrick said the group will continue to organize and push their demands to the UC level to ensure system-wide sanctions for perpetrators of sexual misconduct.</p>\n<p>“This is clearly the beginning — not the end — for us,” Weyrick said. “We have a meeting on Monday set up and the Regents-wide meeting will be big for some of these [demands] that we can implement on a UC-wide basis outside of just UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Weyrick said the group communicated with various organizations to accomplish their goals, initiating conversations about gender representative safety programs with Isla Vista Foot Patrol and establishing a survivor fund for sexual assault victims.</p>\n<p>According to Weyrick, one of the most important accomplishments of the sit-in was a mandate ensuring the removal of students from residence halls if they are found guilty of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“I think the biggest victory was understanding the power of student activism, there’s so much here that we accomplished.” Weyrick said. “If we were just three students sitting in an office … they wouldn’t have [been] taken as seriously, so I feel like the credit needs to go to the bodies that came here and chose to work with us and help us.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Melissa Vasquez said the administrators met the initial demands the group had when they began the sit-in.</p>\n<p>“We came here with something in mind and administration wasn’t trying to hear us out and stuff,” Vasquez said. “We were able to put our foot down and be able to get our demands met, and we had something in mind when we got here and we left with it, too, so it’s kind of really exciting.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63397\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Demonstration_John-Clow-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1154692763\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"63423\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63397\" data-attachment-id=\"63397\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/students-demand-change/rape-protest/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Demonstration_John-Clow-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"John Clow\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"Rape Protest\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1431518175\",\"copyright\":\"John Clow\\/DN\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00025\",\"title\":\"Rape Protest\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Rape Protest\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Demonstration_John-Clow-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Demonstration_John-Clow-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-63397 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Demonstration_John-Clow-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"John Clow/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Demonstration_John-Clow-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Demonstration_John-Clow-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-63397\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">John Clow/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Yang said he was grateful students and administrators were ultimately able to work together.</p>\n<p>“I appreciate the opportunity to hear the survivors speak and also that students have come up with proposals for solutions,” Yang said. “We will continue to refine these solutions.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students President and fourth-year sociology major Ali Guthy said in addition to the approved demands, the university should develop a sexual assault policy specific to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“UCSB doesn’t have our own sexual assault policies. We rely on the UC-wide policy, which I think is really problematic, given that every campus has our own unique circumstances and things that need to be considered,” Guthy said.  “We really need to develop policies that are specific to UCSB, that are consistent, that we can all adhere to.”</p>\n<p>Guthy also said while she cannot speak to the experiences of sexual assault survivors, their stories were compelling and demanded administrative attention.</p>\n<p>“I am concerned for the survivors’ well-being and that everyone is being treated fairly in a consistent manner, and, to me, it seems that our university has failed to meet those basic standards for procedures … the cases we have been hearing today are very compelling,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology and black studies double major Mohsin Mirza said he believes the university does not have appropriate measures in place to support survivors of sexual assault.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We were able to put our foot down and be able to get our demands met, and we had something in mind when we got here. -Melissa Vasquez</p></blockquote>\n<p>“What we saw, it’s the power of student action, student activism,” Mirza said. “We have a serious problem with how sexual assault is handled, with how survivors are treated by administration, by Judicial Affairs and by students on this campus.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said the group will continue fighting to ensure the university enforces the sanctions against sexual misconduct offenders.</p>\n<p>“When they come here and occupy this office and when the supporters of them join them for over 12 hours demanding the changes happen, we were able to make that difference,” Mirza said. “Hopefully, the school’s going to be much better off, and we’re going to keep pressuring the chancellor and administration that they honor the agreements they made tonight, but it’s a historic win.”</p>\n<p>Mirza also said as next year’s A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA), he will ensure the office continues to work on long-term sexual assault policies.</p>\n<p>“Next year, we will be working on making sure that these demands and more changes to make these policies much better will be put in place,” Mirza said. “But many of the changes should be coming very quickly.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[Correction: This article originally stated Alejandra Melgoza is a second-year Chican@ studies and political science double major. However, Melgoza is a second year double majoring in Chican@ studies and history of public policy.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63423\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/yang-meets-sexual-assault-survivors-demands/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63423\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/yang-meets-sexual-assault-survivors-demands/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/yang-meets-sexual-assault-survivors-demands/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/yang-meets-sexual-assault-survivors-demands/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/yang-meets-sexual-assault-survivors-demands/","id":2754,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[2753,2752,2751],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
