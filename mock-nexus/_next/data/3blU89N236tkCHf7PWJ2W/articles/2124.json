I decided to take a little break from baseball this week and talk to you a little bit about the NFL. Not the labor dispute in the lockout.</p>\n<p>But that’s not what I want to talk about. The 2011 NFL draft took place over the weekend and, as usual, there were some big surprises. I’ve picked four drafts to talk about, the two that I think are the best and two that I think are the worst.</p>\n<p><strong> Worst</strong></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong> Carolina Panthers:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>First round selection: QB Cam Newton</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Like the Patriots, the Panthers failed to address their most pressing needs in this year’s draft, namely speed at wide receiver and a first or second-round pass-rushing talent. What they did get was Newton, an egomaniac who will need at least two seasons to prepare before he’s ready to compete at the NFL level. Even then, he’s not guaranteed to fit into an NFL system. For a team that gave up the second-most rushing touchdowns and was last in almost every passing category, drafting a developmental quarterback and no significant defensive help will certainly come back to haunt them in the upcoming season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>New England Patriots:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>First round selection: OT Nate Solder</strong></p>\n<p>The NFL community seems to believe that Bill Belichick is a crafty genius when it comes to the draft. As an ardent Patriots fan I’d like to believe it, yet it is hard for me to see the reason in not drafting a pass-rusher before the sixth round. Sure, Solder might be the heir apparent to the aging Matt Light and QB Ryan Mallett is almost certainly that for Tom Brady — but why draft another corner when they’ve already spent high picks in previous years on Darius Butler and Devin McCourty, and have capable veteran Leigh Bodden to back them up? The most confusing selection of all might be that of tight end Lee Smith in the fifth round after drafting two highly skilled tight ends last year. Maybe Belichick knows something the rest of us don’t. Still, leaving your greatest need unaddressed is never a good idea.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Best</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Buffalo Bills:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>First round selection: DT Marcel Dareus</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Bills had a lot of problems last season but their main one was defense — particularly their rushing defense. They gave up a total of 335 first downs last season (fifth most in the league) and 138 of those were rushing first downs — more than any other team gave up. Because of this, they used their first four picks to revamp their defense at every level with Dareus, CB Aaron Williams, LB Kelvin Sheppard and Da’Norris Searcy. They might have considered spending a pick on a QB, but Ryan Fitzpatrick showed promise last season and they must have faith in him. They addressed their immediate needs and should be a better team when the new season begins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Detroit Lions:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>First round selection: DT Nick Fairley</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After giving up 1999 yards on the ground last season, 18 rushing touchdowns (fifth most in the league) and an average of 4.5 yards per carry, the Lions desperately needed a big body up front to stop the run. They got that in Fairley, who will certainly start next season. Their second pick, WR Titus Young provides them with a speed option for when QB Matthew Stafford has to get rid of the ball quickly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37805\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/green-advice-green-people-nfl-draft/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37805\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/green-advice-green-people-nfl-draft/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/green-advice-green-people-nfl-draft/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/green-advice-green-people-nfl-draft/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/green-advice-green-people-nfl-draft/","id":2124,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2123,2122,2121],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg","biography":"Not available","articles":[286,294,298,299,410,422,425,430,1687,2124,2127,2130,2137,2139,2287,2304,2786,2808,2865,2871,2894,2897,3055,3145,3500,3501,4518,4529,5174,5175,5176,5177,5178,5180,5181,5182,5184,5188,5212,5216,5221,5222,5223,5224,5225,5226,5227,5228,5229,5235,5255,5256,5257,5463,5464,5466,5552],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Surfers Leave the Ocean, Charge Upstream in Indo","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"  I have constantly complained to my peers and family that my life is plagued with indecision — I can’t make up my goddamn mind about anything.

I was abusing the ample array of surf porn available on Surfline when I stumbled over footage of this unbelievable surf phenomenon, known as a tidal bore.</p>\n<p>A tidal bore is caused when an incoming tide pushes waves up a river or narrow bay, counter to the direction of the current. Depending on the ensuing combination of swell, bathymetry, wind and tide, you can get surfable waves that travel up rivers, inlets and bays, although the likelihood of finding a decent tidal bore to surf is rare. I’ve personally never encountered one, but, from the looks of the delicious 8 to 10 foot caramel-colored peelers that legendary pro surfer Tom Curren and crew are pictured surfing up some remote Indo river on, that has to change.</p>\n<p>I’ve seen footage of people surfing river waves before, but “7 Ghosts” (as the new Indonesian shocker has been dubbed) takes things to a whole new level. Hailed by Curren as the product of the best surf-search in 20 years, the video shows the crew charging perfect chocolate milk waves up a remote river in Indo, each wave a mirror-image of the last.</p>\n<p>So now I finally have some material to put on my bucket list: I need to surf an epic tidal bore.</p>\n<p>Having somewhat recovered from a rotator cuff blowout that kept me out of the water last quarter, I’ve been attempting to surf every day this spring. Unfortunately, trying to keep up that charade has been an obvious exercise in denial, and has left a sour taste in my mouth.</p>\n<p>Sure, Rincon is good on a swell under 280 degrees, and Campus will light up on rare occasions, but we’ve been getting these goddamn steep norths that keep shutting the surf down to below chest-height. I haven’t surfed in several days and it feels like forever.</p>\n<p>And now, having caught a tantalizing glimpse of 7 Ghosts, I’m not sure if surfing will be the same.

Book Bank is unique because students can check out books for an entire quarter without returning them.</span> <em>Cameron Hsieh / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students (A.S.) Book Bank is a student-run service that addresses this problem, offering thousands of textbooks </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in all subjects </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to loan for the entire quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Book Bank, located in the Annex across from Storke Tower, is in its fourth year of operation. The problem it faces, however, is a lack of awareness. Of the 2,495 books in the collection this quarter, only 97 were checked out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year communication majors Catherine Barber and Jonathan Lee are working to solve this problem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barber and Lee took Professor Walid Afifi’s Social Marketing (COMM 168) course in Fall Quarter 2018, where students create proposals to resolve problems in the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So my group in particular wanted to help reduce the cost of textbooks for students, just because a lot of students already have a lot of financial burden in their lives,” Barber said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our solution was to come up with some sort of textbook sharing program. But that led to us discovering the A.S. Book Bank.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barber and Lee sent surveys to around 80 students while creating their proposal, and only one student mentioned the Book Bank by name. Both Barber and Lee were unaware of the Book Bank before they began this project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I literally knew nothing about the Book Bank,” Lee said. “I didn’t even know where the Annex was. That was another thing, we recognized that not a lot of people knew where the Annex was.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Barber and Lee heard about the Book Bank, they knew partnering with the organization would be the best way to solve the problem of high textbook prices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s really different from other things that already exist on campus,” Barber said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A.S. Book Bank is unique because students can check out books for an entire quarter without returning them. Other free options such as course reserves at Davidson Library limit students to two hours in the library with checked out textbooks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the course of Fall Quarter 2018, Barber and Lee created a proposal to make students more aware of the Book Bank, which included updating their website and utilizing social media platforms. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86659\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86659\" data-attachment-id=\"86659\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/a-s-book-bank-gains-new-exposure/as-book-bank_cameron-hsieh_online-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AS Book Bank_Cameron Hsieh_ONLINE-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-86659 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86659\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Book Bank’s marketing plan is a collaborative process between Barber, Lee and Jordan. The three meet biweekly and regularly email about their plans. <em>Cameron Hsieh / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of my frustrations with the course was seeing the work that students did, and not getting the chance to implement their work,” Professor Afifi said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Afifi sought to change that this year by introducing a Winter Quarter independent study course, Group Studies for Advanced Students (COMM 194), where groups could actually implement their work from the fall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seven groups continued into winter, including three UCSB projects: the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-12/students-provide-free-groceries-at-food-bank-pop-up-event/\">pop-up food bank</a>, a transfer student connectivity program and the Book Bank marketing campaign. The other four projects focused on the broader community, showing the wide range of what students proposed in the class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Book Bank project and the six others being implemented in this quarter provide a concrete example of what’s possible from this class,” Professor Afifi said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result of the independent study course, Barber and Lee started implementing their ideas to improve the Book Bank at the beginning of the quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At the end of the quarter [Barber and Lee] asked to meet with me to tell us what they worked on,” Katherin Jordan, fourth-year Director of the A.S. Book Bank, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Book Bank’s marketing plan is a collaborative process between Barber, Lee and Jordan. The three meet biweekly and regularly email about their plans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pretty much everything Jonathan and I do, we run by [Jordan]. So we ask her what she needs, and she gives us ideas of what we can do. One of the main things she said she needed help with was marketing, and so that’s kind of the main thing Jonathan and I have done,” Barber said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their strategy for the Book Bank was to increase awareness of the program and make it easier for students to check out books. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To do so, Lee said he and Barber had created a new social media plan for the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I post on Facebook and she posts on instagram, and we have 100+ followers on instagram and 300+ likes on our Facebook. Apparently people show up at the Book Bank asking about it all the time at the Annex now,” Lee said. “The front desk person was like talking about how there are so many people that come by, and seeing an increase in that was really cool for us to see.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barber and Lee also updated the website so that the entire catalog is online. Students can search by title or ISBN number, and the website will show whether the textbook is available or checked out. Students can then go to the Book Bank to fill out an order form and pick up their textbook for the quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are plans to expand the website in the future so students can check out books completely through the website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the things we’re working on, which we haven’t quite figured out yet, is making it so you can check out the book completely online. Right now, we’re kind of working with the website and figuring out how to do that,”  Barber said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another main project of Barber and Lee’s marketing campaign is to promote further growth of the Book Bank through book donation. The Book Bank will hold a book drive during finals week, where students can donate used textbooks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The book drive is vital to the Book Bank’s growth because of limits on where the Book Bank can purchase textbooks from. The Book Bank isn’t allowed to purchase books from the Free &amp; For Sale Facebook Page or from the book exchange, because every single purchase made requires a receipt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The books acquired have to be through donations or through purchasing books and actually receiving a receipt at legitimate websites or the publishers in general,”  Lee said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There will be donation boxes for the Book Drive at the Multicultural Center, the Student Resource Building, the Pardall Center in Isla Vista and at the Book Bank.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of textbooks end up just sitting on people’s shelves or they get thrown away or they get sold for like 99 cents. That’s not doing anything to help anyone. So it’s just really helpful to donate your textbooks to a good cause and help future students like you save money,” Barber added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Book Bank’s expansion in the future includes plans to depart from the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee (SIRRC) and become an independent entity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SIRRC has been a great supporter and one of the main reasons the Book Bank has stayed alive for this long,” Jordan said. “As I started to work on improvements and future plans for the Book Bank, I realized that the Book Bank was outgrowing SIRRC and was ready to become a fully independent entity.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With the Book Bank being its own, there comes a lot quicker turn around on projects… as well as more money being focused purely on the Book Bank projects and improvements to provide the best resources for students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Jordan, Barber and Lee are all seniors, they are looking for others to continue their work in the future. This led to the creation of the marketing intern position, where more than 80 students have already applied.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We don’t want this project to just be a winter quarter thing. The marketing intern would just kind of take on what Catherine and I are doing right now, in terms of running the Facebook, managing the website and the Instagram,”  Lee said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The marketing intern would help spread awareness of the Book Bank after Barber, Lee and Jordan graduate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is probably unreasonable, but I think our goal would be to have every student at least know about the Book Bank,” Lee said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wish I had known about it sooner, and so even freshmen coming in to discuss it the way people talk about the course reserves, that it would just be common knowledge, and that people would recognize that this is a resource available to them.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Senate is already doing to address menstrual product availability. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would be interested in helping out with the efforts that have already started,” Moon said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moon added that while progress has been made with some bike racks on campus, he would like to make improvements on the bike racks behind the Arbor and Girvetz Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m also interested in working on new ideas, like I’m interested in working on the issue of food insecurity,” Moon said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though Moon had not been elected during Spring Quarter 2018, he still focused his attention toward advocating for UCSB students this past year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moon went to the last two lobbying trips organized by Associated Students (A.S.) Lobby Corps, one to Sacramento and one to Washington, D.C., and has spoken to legislators on the state and federal levels about higher education issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For the state trip, we talked about the summer Cal Grant and advocated for certain budget asks… more funding for basic needs, more funding for undocumented students in terms of legal help they can get,” Moon said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moon also recently became one of the two UCSB Campus Leaders for the Student Ambassador Program within the UC Advocacy Network. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The UC Advocacy Network is a community of committed people who lend their voices to shape state and federal policies promoting the university’s mission of education, research and public service,” according to the <a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/support-uc/ucan/about\">UC’s website</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These dedicated advocates send letters and emails and call government officials and policymakers to let them know about the positive impact the university has had on them and others,” the website added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This past year, Moon has also served as the Events Coordinator of the A.S. Isla Vista Community Relations Committee. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m looking forward to working with everyone in the Senate. I’ve known these people for quite awhile now and I’m very excited to work with them within this setting,” Moon said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moon said he has not received the training that A.S. senators undergo, but he has discussed when and how to undergo the training with Internal Vice President Steven Ho. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding Salari, Moon said he believes Salari served admirably while she was on Senate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m sorry to see that the situation had to end like this,” Moon said. “I wish Yasamin the best in all of her future endeavors.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article said that Moon is currently one of the two UCSB Campus Leaders for the UC Advocacy Network.
