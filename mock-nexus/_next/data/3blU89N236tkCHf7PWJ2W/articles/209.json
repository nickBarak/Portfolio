With four of the matches being decided by tie breaks, the Gauchos stayed confident and avoided costly unforced errors to topple LMU for the third straight year. UCSB hopes to continue its use of a skillful offense this weekend against the pair of teams from Washington.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos (1-3) will first face Washington St. (5-1), which has been on an impressive run so far this season. In their last game, the Cougars rallied past Minnesota 4-3. Starting at first singles for Washington St. is Elizaveta Luzina who has been dominant for the Cougars, winning five of her last six matches. UCSB junior April Scatliffe will be facing Luzina in Saturday’s tough matchup.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We need to be extremely resilient and ready to take on some tough opponents,” Scatliffe said. “It will definitely be tough, especially because they will have the indoor home court advantage, due to snow. Our energy will have to remain high for the entire time and each of us will have to be willing to step up and take chances when the opportunities present themselves.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will then head to Seattle where they will face the No. 41 ranked University of Washington (3-1). In Washington’s last match they faced Minnesota, outlasting the visiting team 4-3. Washington has had a commanding season thus far, impressively defeating UNLV 4-3 and Long Beach State 5-2; their only loss came to No. 8 ranked California. Washington will be one of the tougher opponents that the Gauchos have faced this season.</p>\n<p>“We are really excited for this weekend because it will be a great experience flying out of state together to compete,” Scatliffe said. “We will also be playing our matches indoors for the first time. We are very prepared considering we played some great tennis last weekend in Los Angeles and San Diego and have been training hard.”</p>\n<p>This weekend will be a great test for the Gauchos, who are still in the process of restructuring their lineup in order to give them their best chance of winning. The Gauchos will be without senior Kiersten Meehan for the second consecutive weekend due to an injury that Meehan suffered earlier in the season. Meehan has been an important aspect for the team and started at first singles in the home opener against San Francisco on Jan. 26.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will also be playing two matches in the course of 24 hours, but will have to travel from Washington State in Pullman to University of Washington in Seattle. This is a distance of nearly 300 miles. UCSB clearly has a difficult task ahead of them, and will look to upset two dominant teams this weekend in the Evergreen State.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s match against Washington State is scheduled to begin at 11 a.m., while Sunday’s match is scheduled for a 10 a.m. start time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53884\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/gauchos-travel-north-for-pair-of-games/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53884\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/gauchos-travel-north-for-pair-of-games/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/gauchos-travel-north-for-pair-of-games/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/gauchos-travel-north-for-pair-of-games/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/gauchos-travel-north-for-pair-of-games/","id":209,"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete"},"related":[208,207,206],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete","biography":"Not available","articles":[171,175,178,189,192,194,196,208,209,210,211,217,219,305,658,659,662,728,746,749,785,786,1774,1806],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Reeling Gauchos Host Aztecs In Hopes of Earning First Home Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-12-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web-e1580359314548.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web-e1580359314548.jpg?resize=900%2C596&ssl=1","description":"Losers of nine straight, the UCSB women's basketball team will look to pick up their second win of the season hosting San Diego State on Friday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_80012\" style=\"width: 485px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"559859990\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80294\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80012\" data-attachment-id=\"80012\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/amidst-7-game-slide-gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-vs-lmu/danae-miller-moves-the-ball-up-the-court-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web-e1580359314548.jpg?fit=900%2C596&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"900,596\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Danae Miller moves the ball up the court.

In comparison to the youthful Santa Barbara lineup, the SDSU starters are predominantly seniors, with guard McKynzie Fort leading the charge for the Aztecs.</p>\n<p>Fort is a 5’9 guard and has led her team in scoring in 7 of SDSU’s games this season, averaging team high numbers in points as well as rebounding. In addition to her 16.4 points per game, Fort averages 5.4 boards per contest.</p>\n<p>While the Aztecs will certainly rely on production from their seniors, Santa Barbara will look to build off the performance against LMU Monday.</p>\n<p>Disregarding the final score, the Gauchos outscored the Lions in the second half and found success feeding the ball to Drew Edelman, who finished with 21 points and 8 boards on an efficient 9-13 shooting.</p>\n<p>When Edelman is having those types of games, it seems the Gauchos have an easier time on offense; however, Edelman’s success in the paint may simply be the result of Santa Barbara running its offense the way head coach Bonnie Henrickson desires.</p>\n<p>Henrickson has repeatedly stressed the need to swing the ball and find the open player, whether that equates to an open three or a feed inside.</p>\n<p>With two true freshman point guards in Danae Miller and Sarah Bates, Henrickson’s offense has taken time to be carried-out correctly, but UCSB is continuing to show glimpses of efficient ball movement.</p>\n<p>The only other player on the Santa Barbara roster averaging double-digit scoring is redshirt junior Sarah Porter. Porter is averaging 10.4 points a game despite shooting just 35 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>With almost every Gaucho on the UCSB roster playing at least 10 minutes per contest, each game brings the opportunity for players to give their team that necessary spark either off the bench or from the opening buzzer.</p>\n<p>Facing SDSU will be a good opportunity for the Gauchos to keep translating what they’ve been improving upon in practice to real-game scenarios against a more appropriate opponent than a top-ten team like UCLA.</p>\n<p>Showing progressive improvement, Santa Barbara has worked to cut down its turnover numbers, which have plagued the Gauchos much of this season.</p>\n<p>Averaging 16.7 turnovers per game, the Gauchos limited themselves to losing the ball only 11 times against LMU, their lowest number since the regular season opening win at Northern Arizona.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, UCSB showed more intensity on the defensive end facing LMU, recording 8 steals and forcing 19 turnovers. If Santa Barbara is able to build off of these improvements, the Gauchos may also solve their issue of slow starts.</p>\n<p>In their past three matchups, the Gauchos have failed to score more than 11 points in each first quarter, so Henrickson’s team will likely aim to get off to a better start against SDSU on Friday.</p>\n<p>Last year, the Aztecs hosted Santa Barbara and won by a margin of 14, so Friday’s matchup will also offer the Gauchos a chance at redemption.</p>\n<p>The action between UCSB and SDSU will tip off at 7:00 pm on Friday, December 22 at the Thunderdome.</p><div

I’ll hit you harder the second time, so you better stay away.”</p>\n<p>She then talked about why she chose UCSB and how she felt stepping on the beachside campus for the first time.</p>\n<p>“I know it’s going to sound really corny, but I came to the campus and just had a feeling. I fell in love,” she said. “I didn’t have to look anywhere else.”</p>\n<p>Five minutes later, she told me about the shoulder injury that almost ended her athletic career and the father she reunited with for the first and last time on his deathbed 3,000 miles away in Boston, 17 years after he abandoned his family.</p>\n<p>“It all happened at the same time,” she said. “The injury, [my dad] coming back… all at the same time.”</p>\n<p>Makenna’s father, Kevin McKenzie, a Jamaican musician who sold hospital beds by day, left the family in 1992 — before Makenna was born — to pursue a music career in Miami.</p>\n<p>“I think when you’re dealing with artistic people, they need to be able to do that sort of thing,” said Makenna’s mother, Pamela. “We had a discussion about it, and I didn’t think he’d actually do it, but he did. His intent was to contact us and to bring us over there, but it never happened.”</p>\n<p>Pamela, who was still pregnant when McKenzie left, immediately realized the urgency of the situation. She enrolled in school shortly after Makenna was born to pursue a nursing career, graduating with an associate’s degree five years later.</p>\n<p>“The bottom line: It doesn’t matter,” Pamela said. “[I told the girls] that the thing about your dad is that we’re grateful that he was there to create you, but he’s not the center of [their] universe. There’s no time to pity. You just need to do the next thing.”</p>\n<p>For Makenna, the next thing was sports. Before moving across the country, her father played cricket in Jamaica and in local leagues throughout Fountain Valley, CA. Her older sister, Keisha, played basketball  in college. Even Makenna’s aunt, Pamela’s younger sister, earned a softball scholarship at Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>“[Sports] do kind of go way back in [Makenna’s] family,” Pamela said. “Back in my mom’s day they wore skirts and played half court ball because full court was too much work for a woman.”</p>\n<p>By the age of 15, Makenna was one of the best goalkeepers in the country, earning a spot on the Under-15 U.S. Girls’ National Team. She began gaining attention from the nation’s top collegiate programs.</p>\n<p>“She was a big-time recruit, period,” Head Women’s Soccer Coach Paul Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>“I loved how professional everything was,” Makenna said of the national team. “For the first time, I saw how things really were when you get to that level. Everything you do is for your team. Everything.”</p>\n<p>When she injured herself, the top collegiate programs began shifting their attention elsewhere. Although Makenna talked about how the experience helped her develop as a Division 1 soccer player, she also lost her spot on the national team, according to Pamela. A month later, she received a letter from her father’s side of the family in Boston, which claimed that her father had  cancer and that she should visit.</p>\n<p>Makenna looks at each transformative stage of her life as a stepping stone in building herself as an athlete and a person, as “hurdles I needed to jump.” According to Stumpf, she has room to grow as a player, but the team is comfortable with her abilities.</p>\n<p>“She’s a kid who has had different experiences, but she’s not bitter about the world,” Stumpf said. “She’s one of the most mature, confident kids I ever met.”</p>\n<p>After college, Makenna hopes to become either a sports psychologist or a coach. She takes the field again at Harder Stadium against Cal State Northridge on Oct. 8. at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Meanwhile, the Gauchos have been shifting their starters each match, as they have been trying to arrange their most efficient lineup, so the Gaucho who will be facing Mueller is yet to be determined.</p>\n<p>“We have to play on each court with toughness,” Head Coach Simon Thibodeau said. “LMU is similar to San Francisco. We have to just be more consistent, move better and we have to want it more than the other team on the court. I’m not panicking about the 0-2 start to the season; it’s a long season and the goal is for each match to help get us ready for the Big West.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara should hope that history repeats itself this Sunday as the Gauchos have beaten LMU the last three out of four meetings. The Gauchos do have a number of new teammates this year such as freshmen Melissa Baker, Kaiulani Boyer and Jaimee Gilbertson, all who look to be great additions to the women’s team.</p>\n<p>“We feel good about this Sunday’s match. I feel like these past few matches have really just been a means for us to adjust to the new atmosphere we now have as a team,” senior Kiersten Meehan said. “We have a lot of new members this year as well as people coming back from injury, which is something we never really have had to deal with before. I feel like we are getting used to these changes and becoming more of a unit and hopefully that will show against LMU.”</p>\n<p>Meehan started at number one singles for the Gauchos in their last meeting against USF. Meehan was defeated by Thyra Taune 1-6, 0-6. Yet, the women’s team looks to be in a state of repair and a win against LMU this Sunday could bring new life to the Gauchos and rejuvenate the team after an early season slump.</p>\n<p>“I think we all just need to be on the same page,” Meehan said. “We all need the same focus, same attitude and same will to win that day. It would make each of the seven matches an absolute battle for LMU to win if we are able to do this.”</p>\n<p>Games will start at 11 a.m. at the LMU Tennis Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 30th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53787\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-try-for-first-win-of-the-year-against-undefeated-lmu-try-to-win-for-third-straight-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53787\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-try-for-first-win-of-the-year-against-undefeated-lmu-try-to-win-for-third-straight-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-try-for-first-win-of-the-year-against-undefeated-lmu-try-to-win-for-third-straight-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-try-for-first-win-of-the-year-against-undefeated-lmu-try-to-win-for-third-straight-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/gauchos-try-for-first-win-of-the-year-against-undefeated-lmu-try-to-win-for-third-straight-year/","id":208,"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete"},"related":[207,206,205],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
