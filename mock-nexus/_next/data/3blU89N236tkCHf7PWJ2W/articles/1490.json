UCSB took a 1-0 lead after Hromatko’s score.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders responded with two goals of their own both in the second half by freshman defender Darielle O’Brien. O’Brien’s first goal came off a corner kick in the 55th minute that flew past a line of UCSB defenders into the top right of the net. Following this, the freshman defender beat her man off a cross from the left side. O’Brien made her way towards goal and punched a chip shot in a similar spot to her first goal.</p>\n<p>After freshman forward Jessica Parque set the equalizer in the 72nd minute, the two teams ended regulation with the score tied at two apiece.</p>\n<p>Heading into extra minutes, the Gauchos wasted no time in putting the match away. In the 104th minute Santa Barbara led an attack down the right flank as Ball set up sophomore midfielder Chase Schornstein for an easy game-winner. Schornstein’s goal to the bottom left corner marked her third score of the season and her first in conference play.</p>\n<p>“In this conference there is nothing easy,” said Head Coach Paul Stumpf. “[As a coaching staff] we know how hard these student athletes work. When they get rewarded for that effort and those final minutes, that has to be the most [satisfying] feeling for us.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos racked up seven corner kicks in their 3-2 victory along with 10 shots and three shots on target. Senior goalie Beth Ritter also made two in the 87th minute that kept her team locked at 2-2.</p>\n<p>Friday night couldn’t have ended on a more perfect note as this match was dedicated to the seniors on the team.</p>\n<p>“Our main [goal] was heading into the match winning it for our seniors, especially since our team hasn’t made it to the Big West Tournament since 2009,” said Hromatko. “Our seniors have never been there and as a team we wanted to give them that opportunity to get as many wins so that we could get into that tournament.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s last trip to the Big West Tournament ended in a 1-1 draw to Long Beach State in the conference finals. Stumpf is grateful his seniors’ drought without a Big West appearance will come to an end.</p>\n<p>“We punched our ticket to the tournament with today’s win. This group of seniors hasn’t made it to the Big West, so for the first time in a couple years they get the whole deal.”</p>\n<p>Following a hard fought win on Friday, the Gauchos had their work cut out for them facing a physical 6-9-1 UC Irvine team. The Anteaters headed into Sunday’s match coming off a 2-0 blowout on the road at Cal Poly. While their record did not show it, the Anteaters came prepared for a much bigger UCSB team in a game that could potentially knock them out of Big West contention.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters’ scrappiness proved to be a problem for the Gauchos as the majority of the first half was a battle for possession. Despite a season-high six corner kicks in the first half, all from junior midfielder Dakota Griggs, UCSB could not capitalize on their opportunities, heading into half with the score tied at zero.</p>\n<p>“I think we struggle with our second chances a lot,” said Griggs. “We get our head on it the first time but we need to do a better job getting [the ball] into a scoring position to make up for our second chances.”</p>\n<p>After a slow-paced second period, UCSB finally got the breakthrough it needed in the final minutes from none other than Hromatko.</p>\n<p>The freshman’s number was called in the 87th minute off a nice touch pass from Ball. Hromatko dribbled laterally past a group of defenders towards the middle of the penalty box. With her momentum drifting left and a swarm of defenders on her back Hromatko took a dead stop and shot a line drive down the middle to the lower left area of the goal. This late goal was all the Gauchos needed to take a 1-0 victory in dramatic fashion.</p>\n<p>“That was a great ball in by Amanda,” said Hromatko. “Our coaches were telling us to start connecting with each other more, so that was a great pass by her. I was able to feel a defender on my back and turn a shot on them since we only had a couple minutes left [in the game].”</p>\n<p>The Anteaters’ loss marks UCSB’s seventh shutout of the season. After its second straight weekend sweep, Santa Barbara looks to be in good shape heading to its final two matches against No. 1 ranked Cal State Fullerton and No. 4 ranked CSUN.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will resume action next Thursday, Oct. 29 in a 7 p.m. matchup against Fullerton. The match will be featured on ESPN 3. UCSB will wrap up conference play on Sunday against Northridge at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65784\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/ucsb-pushes-win-streak-to-four-with-wins-over-ucr-and-uci/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65784\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/ucsb-pushes-win-streak-to-four-with-wins-over-ucr-and-uci/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/ucsb-pushes-win-streak-to-four-with-wins-over-ucr-and-uci/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/ucsb-pushes-win-streak-to-four-with-wins-over-ucr-and-uci/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/ucsb-pushes-win-streak-to-four-with-wins-over-ucr-and-uci/","id":1488,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1487,1486,1485],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Soccer Closes Season Looking to Secure First Place","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015.10.23_StephenManga_WSoccer-8-print.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015.10.23_StephenManga_WSoccer-8-print.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Already having clinched a spot in the Big West Tournament, the UCSB women's soccer team plays its final regular season games hoping to overtake the No. 1 seed.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s soccer team is in full control of its own destiny this week, ending its last two conference matches on the road against Cal State Fullerton and Cal State Northridge.

The Titans have won seven out of their last eight contests.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will have its work cut out for it as Fullerton’s redshirt senior forward Rebecca Wilson ranks first in the Big West with 16 goals and 37 points. Wilson netted her 16th goal of the season with a go-ahead shot in the 73rd minute to lift her team to a 1-0 victory over Cal State Northridge last Sunday.</p>\n<p>The Big West’s leading scorer has helped her team achieve its 12-game winning streak at home, a run dating back to Oct. 23 of last season. Fullerton has been dominant in Titan Stadium — in addition to its winning stretch at home, the Titans have knocked in 30 of its last 36 goals at home.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior goalkeeper Jennifer Stuart will also be a key player to watch for Fullerton. Having nothing short of a breakout year, she owns a .849 save percentage behind goal, good for first in the Big West. Stuart contributed six saves in the Titans’ shutout victory over CSUN, earning her Big West Defensive Player of the Week honors. She comes into Friday’s match with six shutouts on the year, including a perfect record of 11-0 this season and 23-5-2 for her career.</p>\n<p>Following Friday’s game, UCSB’s regular season finale will be against Cal State Northridge. The Gauchos are 15-7 in head-to-head bouts with the Matadors. Despite a solid record against the Matadors, CSUN holds the upper edge, taking last year’s match against UCSB in a 1-0 shutout.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Cynthia Sanchez will carry the load for the Matadors, entering with a second-place ranking in goals scored in the Big West with 11. She last scored in CSUN’s 2-1 victory against Cal Poly on Oct. 11 Sanchez has 25 points on the year.</p>\n<p>UCSB will travel on the road for its Thursday night match at Fullerton. The match will start at 7 p.m. The Gauchos’ final game against CSUN will kickoff on Sunday at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65909\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/womens-soccer-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65909\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/womens-soccer-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/womens-soccer-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/womens-soccer-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/womens-soccer-2/","id":1489,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1488,1487,1486],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Blue-Green Rivalry: Chapter Two","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The time has arrived!

We just have to fight and find a way to win.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Both sides are separated by just one point in the standings, with UCSB at 10-5-1 overall and 5-2 in Big West coming off a close win over UC Davis yesterday. The Mustangs picked up a big win themselves yesterday over Sac St. to stay just behind Santa Barbara at 9-3-3 overall and 4-1-2 in conference.</p>\n<p>For those who weren’t there last year when the Gauchos hosted the Mustangs in October 2014, the annual Blue-Green matchup drew an audience of 14,345 crazy fans, the second-largest campus crowd in NCAA history.</p>\n<p>That number could very well go even higher this time around, with both top-20 sides generating a high level of buzz so far this season.</p>\n<p>“That was a big part of my recruitment,” sophomore defender Fuad Adeniyi said. “I’ve been dreaming about playing in front of [large crowds], especially our fans, who we all know and love. They all pump us up for the game. It’s really, really good playing in front of them.”</p>\n<p>Expectations were high for the Gauchos coming into the year after having finished with a No. 1 seed in each of the past two seasons, and they have not disappointed in 2015.</p>\n<p>Junior Nick DePuy hasn’t been able to stay out of the headlines over the past year, currently leading the nation in game-winning goals with seven and ranking second overall with 12.</p>\n<p>That’s not too bad of a stat line for a player that didn’t even play forward until midway through his sophomore season.</p>\n<p>DePuy isn’t the only Gaucho making noise in the stat department this season. Freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong has been absolutely crucial for his team, tied for the Big West lead in assists with seven in just his freshman year while picking up a point in eight of the Gauchos’ last 11 games.</p>\n<p>Despite a perfect 4-0 start to conference play, the Big West has since learned that UCSB is most certainly not unbeatable. A terribly disappointing 5-2 loss at Sac St. last Wednesday ended a five-game winning streak for Santa Barbara just three days before it suffered its second straight loss at Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Those two losses were not all negative for UCSB, however, as they saw the return of junior left back Ismaila Jome. After missing nearly eight full games with an ankle sprain, the former Big West Freshman of the Year showed just how important he is by scoring in each of his first two games back.</p>\n<p>“I think the losses affected us in a good way,” sophomore left back Randy Mendoza said. “We were on a high when we were 4-0, and I think it’s making us hungry and realize that nothing is going to be given to us.”</p>\n<p>Defensive issues have become somewhat of a plague for the Gauchos since the beginning of Big West play. Through their first six conference games, they conceded 11 goals, just one less than the conference’s worst defenses over that span.</p>\n<p>Leading the UCSB defense is a player who is no stranger to the Blue-Green rivalry in goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg, son of long-time UCSB Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg.</p>\n<p>The freshman, who has spent time playing for the US men’s national soccer team (USMNT) U-20 squads, has had a solid year, going 10-4 as a starter and ranking fifth in the conference in goals against average at 1.32.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been in the stands for quite a few [UCSB-Cal Poly games] — some wins, some losses,” the younger Vom Steeg said. “It’s a real emotional game.”</p>\n<p>With three games still to play this season, the Mustangs have already surpassed their mark of eight wins in 2014.</p>\n<p>It’s no surprise that Cal Poly has been able to turn things around this year behind first year head coach Steve Sampson, who boasts an incredible resume that few coaches at this level, if any, could rival.</p>\n<p>Sampson has coached at virtually every competitive level, leading Santa Clara to a national championship in 1989, managing the US Men’s National Team in the 1998 World Cup, leading the Costa Rican national team to its highest ever FIFA world ranking of 17 in 2004 and winning both the U.S. Open Cup and MLS Cup in 2004 with the Los Angeles Galaxy.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs have lost just one game out of their last nine, picking up their biggest win of the year just five days ago at home against UCSB.</p>\n<p>After a thrilling first half in which both teams notched two goals, a sold-out crowd of 11,075 was forced to wait until the 104th minute before Cal Poly’s junior defender Kody Wakasa scored his first career goal on a corner kick, sending UCSB to its second straight Big West loss and bringing Cal Poly just one point out of first.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos managed to dominate in the shot department, outshooting the Mustangs 23-12, but Cal Poly’s senior goalkeeper Wade Hamilton was able to make seven big saves to help his team to victory.<br>\nHamilton currently sits at second in the Big West with a 1.01 goals against average.</p>\n<p>“Saturday was really tough. I thought we deserved to win and with seven minutes left they score off a corner kick. It was a pretty crazy environment,” Justin Vom Steeg said. “I’m really looking forward to this Saturday to get some revenge and hopefully we can show them up with a big victory in front of our home crowd.”</p>\n<p>The large audience tied for the 12th largest regular season crowd in NCAA history, but will likely be even bigger this Saturday at Harder Stadium, which seats 17,000. The Blue-Green rivalry is considered the greatest rivalry in college soccer for a reason, as evidenced by the fact that the two sides have provided 12 of the 18 largest audiences in college soccer since 1980.</p>\n<p>Looking at how the two teams have fared against one another over the years, UCSB has come away with the advantage at 45-18-7. However, the Mustangs have done well to flip the script in recent years, outdueling the Gauchos to the tune of a 4-3-2 record through their last nine meetings.</p>\n<p>While many Gaucho supporters are looking at this storied rivalry’s upcoming installment as a chance for revenge, Jome summed up his team’s mindset in two words: “Just win.” Regardless of all the hype, statistics and big names involved in this game, we’ll just have to wait for Saturday to see what happens.</p>\n<p>The second Blue-Green rivalry matchup of 2015 will kick off at 7 p.m. this Saturday at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 13 of October 22, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65601\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/blue-green-rivalry-chapter-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65601\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/blue-green-rivalry-chapter-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/blue-green-rivalry-chapter-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/blue-green-rivalry-chapter-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/blue-green-rivalry-chapter-2/","id":1487,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1486,1485,1484],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
