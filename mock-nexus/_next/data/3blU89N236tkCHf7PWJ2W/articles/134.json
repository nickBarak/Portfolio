Yet, thanks to the efforts of the 1990 squad, the Gauchos will always be part of the select group of winners at the tournament, something that conference rivals Fullerton, CSUN, UC Davis, UC Irvine, and Cal Poly cannot claim.</p>\n<p>It takes a truly special team, or at least exceptional luck to cross that boundary from loser to winner. This year, Marshall, Buffalo, and UMBC’s shocking upsets removed themselves from that list of winless squads and those fan bases will always remember the day they became winners. While the Gauchos are in the midst of a seven year absence from the tournament, we will always remember the one time we were winners.</p>\n<p>It is March 15th, 1990. The venue: Thompson-Boling Arena in Knoxville, Tennessee. Seeded 9th in the Southeast Region, UCSB is led by the nation’s second leading rebounder Eric “The Freeze” McArthur at 13 per game and sharpshooter and fellow senior Carrick DeHart, who led the Gauchos in scoring at 15.9 PPG. Big man Junior Gary Gray, and sophomore wings Paul Johnson and Lucius Davis make the rest of the Gauchos core. All year they played an unselfish brand of basketball, relying on a suffocating defense and good rebounding, coached by Jerry Pimm. DeHart and McArthur nearly made it to the NBA with the Boston Celtics before playing careers that would take them all across the world.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The team set on stopping the Gauchos from reaching their first tournament victory is the Houston Cougars, led by forward and eventual two-time NBA Champion Carl Herrera and only 6 years removed from the Phi Slama Jama-era teams that went to back-to-back championship games.</p>\n<p>Unlike this year’s first time tournament winners, UCSB wasn’t considered a heavy underdog heading into their game. Their seniors had NCAA tournament experience from two years prior and during the season, the Gauchos had given UNLV their last taste of defeat before the Runnin’ Rebels would win the National Championship that year. UCSB had the potential to play with the best teams in the country, but inconsistency had plagued them all season with losses to mediocre Iowa and Pacific, twice.</p>\n<p>Hard fought throughout, the Gauchos topped the Houston Cougars on the strength of their defense and rebounding, their grind-it-out style a relic of an older era before 3 pointers reigned. In the first half, UCSB controlled the boards particularly well with 17 second chance points. The biggest highlight was a beautiful lob alley-oop dunk from Paul Johnson to Eric McArthur. Despite the advantage in rebounding and turnover differential, UCSB’s poor shooting percentage led to the game being tied at halftime.</p>\n<p>After a long two pointer by Lucius Davis, a sophomore who in two years would achieve Big West Conference Player of the Year, UCSB led by single digits throughout the entire second half until a late run by Houston put the Cougars in the lead by a single point with a minute to go. The Gauchos would rely on what they had all season in order to pull out a victory. An air ball caught by McArthur and put back for an easy bucket put the Gauchos in the lead and after McArthur sunk a free throw on the next possession, the Gauchos led by 2 with 20 seconds left. As Houston tried to send the ball into the post for a score as time wound down, the Gauchos’ heart and soul, Eric “The Freeze” McArthur stole the ball. Just like that the game was over.</p>\n<p>McArthur would finish with a stuffed statsheet of 20 Points, 11 Rebounds, 5 Blocks and 4 Steals. Thanks to the near superhuman effort of McArthur and support from forward Gary Gray, who finished with 15 points and 9 rebounds, UCSB left the list of eternal losers at the NCAA tournament and joined the victors, a place their opponent had reached in 1961.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos greatest moment, immortalized in a grainy TV broadcast uploaded to YouTube with less than 1000 views, took place on a hideous orange court in Knoxville. “VOLS” surrounds the center court logo, a picture of the state of Tennessee. A small dark circle reading “NCAA” in the middle of the normal logo remained the only clue that this game meant more than a normal regular season tilt. To call the stadium half-empty would be optimistic. Still, 2,000 miles away from campus, as the clock wound down, the cheer of “Gauchos! Gauchos!” rang through Thompson-Boling Arena.</p>\n<p>Watch UCSB’s NCAA Victory Over Houston in full <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76OFx8yLFm0\">here</a></p>\n<p><em>Correction: The Gauchos were last in the NCAA tournament seven years ago.

Everyone had high hopes for Boston, as they just acquired two big all-stars in Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving.</p>\n<p>But in the blink of an eye, about six minutes into the game, Hayward went down with a gruesome left leg injury that would require surgery and render him out of commission for the remainder of the season.</p>\n<p>After losing Hayward early in the season and later losing Kyrie Irving, who had surgery to remove prior placed screws in his left patella, the sports world was in awe of what happened next.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Almost no one expected the Celtics to go as far as they did in the playoffs. Taking an explosive Milwaukee team to 7 games, beating a stacked Philly team in just 5, and taking LeBron James and his cradled Cavs to an eventful Eastern Conference Finals game 7.</p>\n<p>The Celts saw their season slip through their hands in the last few minutes of that game 7, when LeBron took over and the team couldn’t hit a shot to save their lives.</p>\n<p>But despite coming up short in the 2017-2018 season, what lies ahead of this Boston team is perhaps a brighter future than any other franchise in the NBA.</p>\n<p>The Celtics will be legitimate title contenders for years to come, and here’s why…</p>\n<p>Not only do the Celtics have a General Manger mastermind in Danny Ainge (trading the number one pick to obtain Jayson Tatum <em>and</em> a subsequent first rounder?! Amazing!). But they also have the second coming of Greg Popovich in coach Brad Stevens, they’re loaded with young talent, and since acquiring Hayward and Irving, they are no doubt an enticing location for any free agent serious about winning some hardware.</p>\n<p>In order to fully understand the firepower of Boston, it is quintessential to look at the antecedent state of their roster in which they ended their season, understand just what the Celtics have to look forward to in their future draft picks, and take note of what they will look like come training camp when No.11 and No. 20 suit-up once again.</p>\n<p>In terms of their draft picks, let’s take a look at what the Green Machine has in their arsenal:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Celts are in complete ownership of all of their first-round picks going forward. For this year’s upcoming draft, Boston sits at No. 27 overall, barring any trades they may choose to engage in.</li>\n<li>Remember the trade heard ‘round the world? When Ainge deciphered that he could get the same person at No. 3 in the 2017 draft that he could get at No. 1? Remember when everyone said Philly “won” that trade that got them Markelle Fultz? The same Fultz who got to watch the NBA Playoffs the same way the rest of us did – without stepping on the court…? Well, because of Ainge’s gutsy call, the C’s earned the Sacramento Kings’ first round pick in 2019, by way of trade with the 76ers.</li>\n<li>Boston will get the L.A. Clippers’ first round pick in 2019 if it ends up being No. 15 or later, as selections 1 to 14 are protected. If the Celtics don’t end up getting the pick in 2019, then it reverts to a 2020 pick, under same restrictions as the one in 2019. Consequently, if the Celtics don’t get that L.A. pick in 2020, then they will receive the Clippers’ 2022 second round pick.</li>\n<li>Memphis’ first round pick in 2019 will go to the C’s if it turns out to be No. 9 or later. But if that doesn’t go Boston’s way, then in 2020 if the Grizzlies’ selection is No. 7 or later, that pick will go straight to Boston. If those two scenarios don’t lean in Boston’s favor, then the Celtics will receive the Grizzlies’ first round pick in 2021 with no restrictions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is clear that the Celts have more than a couple draft picks up their sleeve. It cannot be ignored though, that draft picks are only as good as the players the franchise chooses to pick up. But given Boston’s track record of successful drafting, that doesn’t seem to be something the C’s are too worried about.</p>\n<p>Boston’s current roster impressed many, by getting within one game of the NBA Finals without their two all-stars.</p>\n<p>Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, Al Horford, Jayson Tatum, and their coach Brad Stevens, are just a few reasons why.</p>\n<p>You would have been a fool to think an offensive powerhouse like Tatum would’ve been anything less than effective this past season. After all, he did come from Duke. However, not many foresaw him developing as much as he did as fast as he did.</p>\n<p>With Hayward going down, it forced Tatum to step up and grow into the force he is inevitably becoming before our very eyes. He effectively plays both ends of the court, and even got a highlight-worthy dunk on LeBron James late in his rookie season.</p>\n<p>20-year old Tatum may not be able to get into a bar just yet, but he’s already got into the hearts of every Celtic fan around the world. Tatum is just a piece of the puzzle that makes up the future of the C’s franchise.</p>\n<p>Boston is extremely versatile, and their roster is loaded with pieces that just “fit”. You’ve got players from the veteran Al Horford, who is a critical piece of the Celtics’ frontcourt and leadership, to the young and explosive dunk-machine Jaylen Brown who is also a force on defense.</p>\n<p>You’d be remiss not to consider Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes, Marcus Smart, and the other competitors that played a big role in the Celts’ great playoff run. But you can contend that a few of those pieces are somewhat disposable if you’re owner Wyc Grousbeck and GM Danny Ainge and are looking to acquire other players.</p>\n<p>Rumor has it that the Celtics may be considering trading Brown and some picks to move up in the draft to gain a shot at big Center Mo Bamba from the University of Texas. But if you know anything about Ainge, these rumors can possibly prove to be nothing but smoke and mirrors, especially since the C’s didn’t trade down in the draft last year until the very last possible second and shocked the world by trading for the third overall pick.</p>\n<p>Brad Stevens has a coaching system that mimics the great Bill Belichick’s, and that became abundantly evident this past season.</p>\n<p>The “next man up” approach the Celtics have adapted is similar to what the New England Patriots refer to as “Do Your Job”, meaning that every player on the roster needs to be ready to come to play, no matter the game or the week.</p>\n<p>Stevens was such a big influence and genius play-caller with the young injury-induced roster he had this past season, so one can only imagine what his greatness can achieve in several years to come with a fully healthy roster.</p>\n<p>Looking at the final minutes of the ECF game 7, and the struggles Boston had scoring, it is evident that Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward are much needed and will have a huge impact once healthy and can push this already good team to become a great one.</p>\n<p>One can’t know for sure, but if those two all-stars were on the roster, some say we would have been watching a very different NBA Finals right now instead of watching Steph Curry and Klay Thompson run circles around JR Smith and Tristan Kardashian (I had to).</p>\n<p>When you consider the current pieces they have, the pending state of the team when Hayward and Irving come back, and the vast amount of picks the Celts have at their disposal, you can easily proclaim that Boston clearly has the best “process” around. And that process didn’t even involve tanking (looking at you, Philly).</p>\n<p>With LeBron’s future in Cleveland hanging in the balance, you could attest that Boston and Philadelphia might be the best two teams in the East starting next season. But even if LeBron does stay in the East, he definitely won’t have an automatic bid to the Finals like he’s had these past 8 years. These ain’t your mommas Boston Celtics, folks. This team is for real.</p>\n<p>The Celtics are set up to win for years to come.</p>\n<p>Who knows? They may even win not 1… not 2… not 3… not 4… not 5…</p>\n<p>On second thought, the last person to make that prognostication ended up getting that amount of NBA Finals losses instead of titles.</p>\n<p>Boston has a bright future ahead of them, they can let their upcoming success speak for itself.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83560\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-21/c-into-the-future-what-lies-ahead-for-the-boston-celtics/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83560\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-21/c-into-the-future-what-lies-ahead-for-the-boston-celtics/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-21/c-into-the-future-what-lies-ahead-for-the-boston-celtics/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-21/c-into-the-future-what-lies-ahead-for-the-boston-celtics/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-21/c-into-the-future-what-lies-ahead-for-the-boston-celtics/","id":131,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[130,129,128],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Tennis Knocked Out of NCAA Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos' chance at a run to the National Championship ended quickly in a loss to Texas Tech","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This past Friday the No. 52 UCSB men’s tennis team faced No. 19 Texas Tech in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.

Trailing 7-2, junior Andrew Riminton and red shirt sophomore Morgan Mays battled back to 7-6 before falling in the next set on court three. As court one stood at a stalemate 6-6, the Red Raiders took a second victory on court two over Galskov and sophomore Teague Hamilton 8-4. Texas Tech headed into singles play leading 1-0.</p>\n<p>The Red Raiders took another big jump on the Gauchos taking the first two singles matches of the day. No. 123 sophomore Jolan Cailleau defeated freshman Cody Rakela in straight sets of 6-2. Mays nearly forced a third set against No. 117 freshman Alex Sendegeya, but was defeated 6-3, 7-5. Texas Tech went up 3-0, in need of just one more win, and play was suspended due to rainfall.</p>\n<p>Just under an hour later, play resumed and the Gauchos began to make a stand. Sophomore Erik Johnsson put UCSB on the board taking a victory on court five in straight sets. Johnsson defeated his opponent, senior Francisco Zambon, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4). Junior Nathan Eshmade was the next to keep the Gauchos alive on court two. He took down junior Hugo Dojas after forcing a third set 4-6, 6-2, 6-1.</p>\n<p>Down just 3-2, UCSB needed victories from both Galskov and Hamilton. Hamilton fought hard on court six losing the first set 6-7(4-7) to freshman Connor Curry. He found himself trailing just 4-5 in the second, looking to force a third set, but his match was called off due to the finish on court one.</p>\n<p>Galskov took on No. 37 junior Felipe Soares and forced him to a third set as they split the first two 4-6, 6-3. The junior Red Raider solidified his team’s spot in the next round taking the third set 6-1 over Galskov.</p>\n<p>“I know the team is very good right now and we’ve progressed so much this year,” Galskov said. “I think they can do a lot of great things next year.”</p>\n<p>This match concludes UCSB’s season.

first time in 16 years, the UCSB women’s tennis team hopes to bounce back from its finals loss against Long Beach State with its latest freshman recruit.</p>\n<p>The addition of 18-year-old Australian native Stephanie Yamada to Santa Barbara is the possible solution. In her career, Yamada has won five International Tennis Federation Championships within doubles competition while competing in Sydney, Brisbane, Gosford, Bundaberg and Ipswich.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>She also excelled in the singles competition, winning a Junior Championship in Brisbane, maintaining an overall record of 31-24. In the Australian rankings, Yamada reached No. 51 in the country while ranked as high as No. 295 in the ITF Junior Rankings.</p>\n<p>“Stephanie Yamada will be a great addition to our roster,” Head Coach Simon Thibodeau said. “She graduated last December and has been using these extra off-months to prepare and train for her college career. Stephanie will bring a high level of play in both singles and doubles.”</p>\n<p>Thibodeau has chosen wisely by recruiting Yamada because of the success she has had in the ITF doubles competition so far in her career.</p>\n<p>While many find it difficult when adjusting to the team aspect of college tennis, Yamada has a slight advantage coming into Santa Barbara. Sophomore Jaimee Gilbertson is Yamada’s former doubles partner from Australia and next year the pair will be reunited to play together in the United States for the very first time.</p>\n<p>“Stephanie and I are very close friends and she is going to be a great contribution to the team,” Gilbertson said. “We won a couple of national doubles titles together in Australia so we already have a chemistry that will be of great benefit to the team.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos showed their strength as a team this year, despite injuries. Various players emerged to play good tennis in their teammate’s place.  Gilbertson played in the No. 1 court for most of the season after starting at the No. 2 position, yet she only lost two conference matches.  This team aspect will be a new challenge for Yamada next year, but certainly nothing she can’t handle.</p>\n<p>“She has a great positive energy, cares a lot about getting better and is really invested in her tennis,” Thibodeau said. “We are all looking forward to having her here on our UCSB campus next fall.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 21, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63637\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/new-recruit-brings-aussie-reunion-to-santa-barbara/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63637\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/new-recruit-brings-aussie-reunion-to-santa-barbara/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/new-recruit-brings-aussie-reunion-to-santa-barbara/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/new-recruit-brings-aussie-reunion-to-santa-barbara/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/new-recruit-brings-aussie-reunion-to-santa-barbara/","id":133,"author":{"id":287,"name":"Evander Hilton"},"related":[132,131,130],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
