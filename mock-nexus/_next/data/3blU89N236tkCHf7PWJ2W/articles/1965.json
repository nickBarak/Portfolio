Students have the option of replacing one of the upper-division art history courses with a portfolio workshop course and a two-unit internship course, according to the minor sheet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The art history and architecture department already provides three academic options for students looking to pursue art-related endeavors: the core major, the core minor and a minor in museum studies, which was first offered to students in Fall Quarter 2018, according to Savannah Parison, the program advisor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The architecture and urban history minor will allow students with an interest in architecture to pursue an education in the field without having to fully dedicate themselves to the discipline, according to Parison.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The project has been in progress for two years with the aim being student enrollment in Fall [Quarter 2019],” Parison said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The curriculum committee, who decided on the content of the new minor, included Professor Swati Chattopadhyay, Professor Claudia Moser and Department Chair Mark Meadow, all from the Department of History of Art &amp; Architecture. Although the program was just unveiled at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2019, Parison said a couple of students have already come in to declare the minor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She noted that the new minor is not exclusive to art history courses; it includes opportunities to take courses within both the geography and environmental studies majors. Both of the aforementioned disciplines offer classes that can be used to fill requirements of the minor, including the geography department’s series on urban or regional planning and the environmental department’s series on sustainable communities, according to Parison.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She clarified that the minor would not solely focus on the classical world, but the architecture of multiple styles and time periods as well.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parison has already noticed an interest in the minor across a variety of academic fields, including </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (S.T.E.M.)</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">majors that usually wouldn’t express interest in art history given the demands of their coursework.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve had a lot of interest from engineering students in the past who want to be involved but can’t double major in two colleges but can do the minor relatively easy. It gives them a way to participate and we’ve received lots of support from the engineering departments and advisors,” Parison said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parison advises students to meet with her before taking on the minor to determine if it will fulfill their needs and interests, or even if the major may potentially be suited for them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are not a university that explicitly prepares students to be an architect and this minor is not the best way to qualify for architecture school.

The other three projects are registering students to vote, educating faculty on alternatives to expensive textbooks and trying to convert the entire UC system to using 100% renewable energy by 2050.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At last count on Wednesday, the petition to eliminate single-use plastics on UCSB’s campus had 461 signatures, nearly a thousand short of the 1,400 signatures CALPIRG hopes to acquire before the quarter ends and a sliver of the 25,976 students currently enrolled at UCSB.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The single-use plastics ban would eliminate items such as straws, utensils and plastic foam take-out boxes distributed by on-campus restaurants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CALPIRG decided on a petition to ban single-use plastics in order to demonstrate widespread student support for the policy to leaders such as UCSB’s Chancellor Henry Yang or University of California President Janet Napolitano, according to Michels.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The UCs are doing a lot for sustainability, but we think we can do more,” CALPIRG’s Organizing Director Kat Lockwood said. “It would make them a world leader [to ban single-use plastics].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC system is already looking into ways to eliminate single-use plastics on campuses by turning to cities with laws minimizing single-use plastics as a model, UC Office of the President (UCOP) Senior Communications Strategist Stett Holbrook said in an email. Berkeley is one such city, which passed a plastic foodware reduction policy in January earlier this year. The UCOP website states that the UCs will ban expanded polystyrene, commonly found in plastic foam take-out containers, by 2020. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC system’s Zero Waste 2020 initiative aims to “divert 90 percent of waste from landfills to recycling and composting facilities, not to eliminate waste by 2020,” Holbrook added. However, the UC system currently measured a 69% diversion rate from 2017-18, according to the 2018 Annual Report on Sustainable Practices, with only three months remaining until 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report also shows that the UC’s diversion rates have hovered in the high-60 and low-70 percentage points since 2017. Holbrook said the UC’s slowed diversion rates are due to “various internal and external barriers, including turmoil in the international recycling markets and the limitations of local waste haulers.” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond eliminating single-use plastics, the UCSB CALPIRG chapter has been working on a project to inform professors about open-source educational resources, or OERs, in an effort to shift professors away from expensive textbooks. When the chapter began the campaign last year, 62 faculty or administration members signed on to show support for it, according to Michels.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve had a lot of students come up to our textbook tables and tell us things that they’ve had to give up,” Jennifer Manning, fourth-year student and CALPIRG board member, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One student said that her dad had to give up their family car in order to be able to afford to pay for her textbooks for that quarter. So we want to avoid people having to deal with struggles that are unnecessary when they have to purchase, like a $200 textbook, because their professor wanted the newest edition.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Manning and Michel said they were considering pushing for textbook prices to be included on G.O.L.D. when students sign up for classes but were still undecided on whether or not to pursue that initiative.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB CALPIRG campaign to get the UCs to run on purely renewable energy is also through a petition, run in the same style as the one banning single-use plastics. Its focus is the heating and cooling units for many on-campus buildings, in addition to the emissions from campus-owned vehicles, according to Manning. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CALPIRG typically works to sign up college students to vote, but this year, the UCSB chapter will pressure the student government to draft a resolution favoring a voting center on campus that allows </span><a href=\"https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/conditional-voter-reg/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">same-day registration</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is only typically allowed at county elections offices and certain designated satellite locations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite her faith that the UCSB community’s values align with CALPIRG’s, Michels admitted that right now, students primarily know them as nuisances with clipboards in the Arbor.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think a lot of it is just a misconception of what we do,” Manning said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They just assume that we’re just this annoying group that wants your signature and wants your money without actually understanding the dynamic of how the group actually operates.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a CALPIRG volunteer approaches someone to ask for their signature, their goal goes beyond drawing support for a petition. It’s also to get contact information, pledge money and possibly a new volunteer, according to Michels.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we find someone that’s interested enough to sign that petition, we’ll ask them to come to another event, so we kind of just exponentially increase the amount of work we can do,” Michels said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each CALPIRG chapter needs to meet a quota of 10-15% of the student body to donate $10 a quarter. The UCSB chapter has never had an issue meeting that number, according to Manning.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it is not one of their immediate projects, Lockwood said CALPIRG’s board is interested in implementing their quarterly fee as an official UC campus cost across the system. Michel said that the overall cost per student would be cheaper than the current $10 fee if they implement this change but did not have a new number representing what each student would pay. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We wouldn’t have to pester you for money because we wouldn’t have to do our pledge drive,” Manning said. “You want CALPIRG to stop bothering you on the Arbor? Then vote to upgrade our funding.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Oct. 3, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em> print edition. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90111\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/calpirg-discusses-latest-projects-plans-for-upcoming-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90111\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/calpirg-discusses-latest-projects-plans-for-upcoming-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/calpirg-discusses-latest-projects-plans-for-upcoming-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/calpirg-discusses-latest-projects-plans-for-upcoming-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/calpirg-discusses-latest-projects-plans-for-upcoming-year/","id":1963,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[1962,1961,1960],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NBA Playoffs Submerged in Injuries","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-05-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/steph-355x230.jpe","mobile_thumbnail":"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/steph.jpe","description":"Staff writer Elliot Thornton discusses the abundance of injuries that have appeared in the most recent years of the NBA Playoffs with regard to this season's postseason health woes.

While these tragic mishaps are unpredictable events that no sports fan desires, these injuries have clearly developed into stumbling blocks for teams during this postseason.</p>\n<p>Take Game 6 of the Los Angeles Clippers and Portland Trailblazers series, for example. Instead of seeing the Clippers’ floor general in Chris Paul finish his toe-to-toe bout with Portland star Damian Lillard, a right hand fracture forced the Clippers’ guard to sit on the sidelines and watch his younger teammate Austin Rivers take on a responsibility only Paul could confidently do: command the team at point.</p>\n<p>Friday night’s matchup did showcase the perseverance and potential of an athlete like Rivers, bouncing back from a bloody left eye injury and embracing the true spirit of competition with a playoff career-high 21 points.</p>\n<p>However, the Clippers arguably could have extended the series and headed back to L.A. for Game 7 if a healthy CP3 and Blake Griffin suited up for their team.</p>\n<p>The loss of two-time champ Chris Bosh has also been a hardship for the Miami Heat to overcome despite their recent series blowout victory Sunday afternoon. An alarming blood clot in the forward’s calf has not only kept Bosh out of commission since the All-Star break, but more notably created a disadvantage for his team.</p>\n<p>In what many considered could have been a sweep against a lower seeded Charlotte Hornets team, this first round matchup resulted in a full seven game series.</p>\n<p>With the absence of Bosh, guard Dwayne Wade has emerged as the sole leader once again and is carrying his team. “The Flash” resembled his 2006 NBA Finals play in order to escape elimination en route to the team’s advancement to the second round.</p>\n<p>While the 13-year vet managed to silence Hornets’ fans with his exceptional postseason play, he surely could utilize his 6’11” teammate as they move deeper into the playoffs.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70597\" style=\"width: 564px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70597\" data-attachment-id=\"70597\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/nba-playoffs-submerged-in-injuries/ap-aptopix-heat-hornets-basketball-s-bkn-usa-nc/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d-wade-2.jpg?fit=1000%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,666\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d-wade-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d-wade-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-70597\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d-wade-2.jpg?resize=554%2C369\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of ftw.usatoday.com\" width=\"554\" height=\"369\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d-wade-2.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d-wade-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d-wade-2.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-70597\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of ftw.usatoday.com</p></div>\n<p>Even the Golden State Warriors, the untouchable reigning champs that pulled off a historic 73-9 regular season record are currently experiencing their own dilemma, arguably the biggest red flag yet in this year’s NBA Playoffs.</p>\n<p>Sending James Harden and Dwight Howard on an empty-handed flight back to Houston, the Pacific Division champs did so at a cost.</p>\n<p>After losing the heart and soul of their team Stephen Curry to a nasty MCL sprain in Game 4 versus the Rockets, “Dub Nation” has depended on veteran Shaun Livingston and newcomer Ian Clark to take the place of the “Baby-Faced Assassin.”</p>\n<p>While the Warriors certainly justified their motto “Strength in Numbers” with a first round knockout and a Game 1 victory versus the Trailblazers, Curry’s questionable timetable certainly factors into how long Golden State will continue to tame Portland’s backcourt duo of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, this injury stricken playoffs start has highlighted how not all teams have it easy in their quest for an NBA Championship. Some teams have been able to persevere through the pain, while others’ seasons have been derailed with pivotal blows to their roster.</p>\n<p>These distressing injuries to Curry, Bosh, Griffin and Paul are all unfortunate strokes of bad luck for their respective squads, but serve a purpose in exemplifying the complexity of this year’s NBA playoffs.</p>\n<p>Now NBA fans must be mindful of the burdens their favorite teams carry forward and are left with the current question until early June of who is likely to hoist that Larry O’Brien trophy.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70593\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/nba-playoffs-submerged-in-injuries/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70593\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/nba-playoffs-submerged-in-injuries/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/nba-playoffs-submerged-in-injuries/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/nba-playoffs-submerged-in-injuries/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/nba-playoffs-submerged-in-injuries/","id":1962,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1961,1960,1959],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
