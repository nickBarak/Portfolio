During the event, Mithi and Pinini will discuss their experiences living through the South African apartheid and how the meaning of the word apartheid is changing.</p>\n<p>Kayla Shenassa, second-year classics major and host of the event, said she wants to encourage people to think critically before reaching conclusions about apartheid and learn about the importance and relevance of the issue.</p>\n<p>“It’s giving me opportunity to help teach and educate my peers about an issue that is really important and crucial to world history, not just South Africa or the Middle East,” Shenassa said. “It’s something that can apply even here in the U.S. where we’ve had to deal with serious race issues, even in this day and age.”</p>\n<p>Bridget Haus, third-year statistics major, said she studied abroad in South Africa last quarter and witnessed how apartheid still affects the community.</p>\n<p>“There were many protests, riots and shut down of university due to lack of progress for the black race post apartheid,” Haus said in an email.</p>\n<p>Andrea Keys, fourth-year linguistics major, said she appreciates the opportunity to learn from people who experienced apartheid first hand.</p>\n<p>“I have only been able to learn about apartheid via the Internet and from YouTube and movies, so it will be an amazing experience to learn about it from people who actually lived through it,” Keys said in an email.</p>\n<p>Emily Wettleson, fourth-year communication and classics major, said silence never brings any change and she appreciates that this event discusses a topic usually left unaddressed.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always felt that quote-unquote ‘uncomfortable’ issues like apartheid are not discussed enough because of the sheer heinous nature of what happened,” Wettleson said in an email.</p>\n<p>Tyler Koontz, fourth-year theater and dance major in the Bachelor of Fine Arts acting program, said issues like apartheid should be discussed to learn from social injustices of the past.</p>\n<p>“The subjects and histories of such injustice should be talked about and taught so that we may hopefully learn and move toward a more progressive and equal state of being,” Koontz said in an email.</p>\n<p>Shenassa said her goal is to inspire people to care about apartheid and encourage people to think critically.</p>\n<p>“My biggest goal would be to open people’s eyes — to get people who may not have cared about this issue or anything connected to this, to think about it for even a minute,” Shenassa said.</p>\n<p>Shenassa said she hopes events such as this one will motivate students to think about current issues in the changing world.</p>\n<p>“It’s started by one thought — one person or a few people coming together and thinking and discussing and moving forward with bringing events like this to campus and going beyond that,” Shenassa said. “Hopefully I can get at least one person to think critically, to care.”</p>\n<p>The event is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. and free pizza will be served to attendees.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

and UCSB alumnus, and Natan Sharansky, author, activist and chair of The Jewish Agency, discussed their relationships with Judaism, anti-Semitism, activism and religious pluralism Wednesday in Pollock Theater.</p>\n<p>The event was part of a three-part university tour titled “Jewish Journeys,” which began Thursday at Brown University and stopped at Stanford University before arriving at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Both Sharansky and Douglas became active in the Jewish community after their childhoods.</p>\n<p>“I grew up knowing zero about my Jewish-ness,” Sharansky said of growing up in Soviet-ruled Donetsk, Ukraine. He said he knew his family was Jewish only because it was “written on the I.D. of your parents” and because of “all the conversations about anti-Semitism and discrimination.”</p>\n<p>Sharansky said being a Jew at the time was like being “born with some very rare disease,” and the only “medicine” was being the best at your trade.</p>\n<p>“Your parents are telling to you, because you are Jewish, everywhere — in school, in university, in kindergarten — you must be number one,” Sharansky said. “In physics or mathematics or in chess or in music or in dance, whatever, it doesn’t matter, you must be the best at your profession. That is the way how we Jews survive.”</p>\n<p>Sharansky said many Jewish people felt a sense of community after the Six-Day War of 1967 — when Israel gained the upper hand against the Soviet Union and its Egyptian and Syrian allies —leading to increased activism among Jews.</p>\n<p>After the war in 1967, Sharansky said, “Israel entered our lives very powerfully because the victory of Israel over allies of the Soviet Union was a huge humiliation for the Soviet Union.”</p>\n<p>Sharansky said, following the Six-Day War, he realized the importance of his connection to the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“Suddenly, you find out, you discover that all the people around you, your friends and your enemies, they all connect you to the Israeli army,” Sharansky said.</p>\n<p>Douglas said after his son’s bar mitzvah, his family visited the Western Wall in Jerusalem, after which the Genesis Prize Foundation recognized his commitment to the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“A few pictures were taken; it made the Israeli press,” Douglas said. “The next thing I know, the Genesis group contacts me and presents this incredible prize, this opportunity which I was truly touched because I felt I was part of a tribe.”</p>\n<p>Douglas said the Israeli government opened a permanent egalitarian prayer space earlier this week at the Western Wall.</p>\n<p>“That is the place where Jews are coming for 3,000 years to talk to God and at the same time; it is the number-one national symbol,” Sharansky said.</p>\n<p>Sharansky said years of negotiations have resulted in the understanding that even though some compromises regarding the Wall may be painful, the unity of Jewish people is more important.</p>\n<p>“For me, it is very important that we as a Jewish community always will be open and welcoming for those who are invested,” Sharansky said.</p>\n<p>Douglas said the Jewish people have reason to be optimistic about their history and the future.</p>\n<p>“It is a sense of community, and I have been deeply inspired by my son and by my father,” Douglas said. “So I see and feel a continuity of generations, a sense of immortality. I am hopeful and optimistic.”</p>\n<p>During the Q&amp;A segment of the event, April Savage, third-year biology major, asked about interfaith climates on college campuses. Douglas responded by encouraging discussion of controversial subjects.</p>\n<p>“People always say, ‘don’t talk about politics or religion and you will always get along.’ I would encourage a dialogue and being able to open up and expose yourself and have the support of Hillel behind you,” Douglas said, referring to the Jewish nonprofit student group.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Evan Goodman, executive director of Santa Barbara Hillel, said UCSB has more Jewish undergraduate students than any other UC campus and that 160 students traveled to Israel on birthright trips last year.</p>\n<p>Andrew Packer, third-year economics and accounting major, described his experience with Santa Barbara Hillel and his birthright experience.</p>\n<p>“For me, Santa Barbara Hillel has enabled me to reconnect with my Jewish roots,” Packer said. “It allows me to continue my cultural exploration of Judaism and opens the dialogue on religion.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Tran / Daily Nexus</em></p>\n<p>Approximately 50 students discussed the meaning and future implications of environmental racism and environmental justice at an event titled “What is Environmental Racism?” on Monday in the MultiCultural Center.</p>\n<p>The event was presented by the Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E), the Human Rights Board and the Environmental Affairs Board (EAB). Attendees discussed environmental and social realities of incidents such as the Flint water crisis in Michigan, mining on Native American reservations, the I-710 corridor project and the Marcopper Mining Disaster in 1996.</p>\n<p>Nia Mitchell, EAB environmental justice chair and fourth-year environmental studies major, began the discussion by defining white supremacy and institutionalized racism.</p>\n<p>“White supremacy is an ideology in which white people or people of European descent are believed to be inherently better over people of color,” Mitchell said. “And it is institutionalized because different institutions uphold that power dynamic, so it is a disproportionate amount of power in certain communities and a lack thereof in others. When you link that system with the system of capitalism you get things like environmental racism.”</p>\n<p>Unique Vance, S.C.O.R.E. co-chair and third-year global studies major, gave an example of environmental racism.</p>\n<p>“One definition is the placement of low income or minority communities in proximity of environmentally hazardous or degraded environments,” Vance said.</p>\n<p>Mitchell said environmental injustice is not just exploitation of the earth and its resources, but of people as well.</p>\n<p>“It is not only that these human beings have to deal with all of this pollution, but we have to think about the flora and the fauna that is being impacted by those polluting sites,” Mitchell said. “Without exploiting land and people at the same time, capitalism, and therefore profit, cannot exist.”</p>\n<p>Vance said government institutions, either intentionally or unintentionally, often ignore toxic waste and pollution, as in the case of Flint, Michigan where the water source from Lake Huron was switched to the Flint River as a cost-saving measure until a new supply line to Lake Huron was ready.</p>\n<p>Virginia Tech researchers found the water was highly corrosive, causing public outcry over the lack of response by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder.</p>\n<p>“The government was well aware of the consequences of lead,” Mitchell said. “Lead is a known neurotoxin to human beings.”</p>\n<p>Mitchell said it is nearly impossible for Flint residents to sell their homes, a struggle that was recently chronicled in <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/us/many-flint-residents-are-desperate-to-leave-but-see-no-escape.html\">The New York Times</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Monaé Orange, third-year black studies and sociology double major, attended the event and said Flint residents are still paying full price for the contaminated water.</p>\n<p>“They are still forced to pay their water bills and they are refusing to refund them for any of that,” Orange said.</p>\n<p>Vance said the people least responsible for climate change are most impacted by it.</p>\n<p>“The modern day environmental justice movement sprouted from some really amazing activists and people who were sick and tired of their communities being targeted by the state for environmental issues,” Vance said.</p>\n<p>Marjan Kris, S.C.O.R.E co-chair and second-year Asian American studies and history of public policy double major, said he and others are in the process of creating an environmental justice minor for UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“We are planning on creating an environmental justice minor at UCSB,” Kris said. “Future first and second-years, probably third-years too, keep an eye out.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Anderson and UCSB professor of philosophy Dr. Quentin Gee argued the deeper issues of same-sex marriage, such as religion, the definition of marriage and social equality.</p>\n<p>Gee, who advocated in favor of the recent ruling, said marriage is an institution that is constantly changing and should be open to all couples.</p>\n<p>“Marriage is something that is generally defined by the society that we live in, and it changes,” Gee said. “The civil institution of marriage has undergone a number of transformational shifts. People should come to realize that the civil institution of marriage is something that should be expanded to same-sex couples.”</p>\n<p>Gee said the idea of marriage is not a “biological feature of humans,” but rather dynamic and culturally constructed.</p>\n<p>“Marriage is something that humans together collectively define in a particular way,” Gee said. “We’re expanding this notion that marriage is this idea of freedom of the individual to choose these relationships of mutual support between two people.”</p>\n<p>Gee said marriage is a “social institution” and focused his argument on the idea that marriage is not strictly for procreational purposes.</p>\n<p>“We’re changing our conception of marriage,” Gee said. “The conception of marriage has changed to what we might call a companionate sense. When you marry somebody, you are taking on an additional life partner, a companion.”</p>\n<p>According to Gee, religion cannot be used as a legitimate excuse to refuse same-sex marriage and said if it is used, it is on the basis of discrimination.</p>\n<p>“There’s no clear reason to exclude same-sex couples [from marriage]. They can offer elements of companionship,” Gee said. “I don’t see any real, compelling reason, and if there is no compelling reason, it’s seems to be more or less a prejudice.”</p>\n<p>Gee said while religion is important to society, it cannot be used to enforce a law that denies rights to same-sex couples.</p>\n<p>“You cannot use religious reasons to justify or create social institutions or social contracts in ways to suit your religious needs,” Gee said. “Everyone ought to respect religion and appreciate the things it brings to our lives, but at the same time, we cannot impose it. And laws impose.”</p>\n<p>According to Gee, there is no valid reason to deny same-sex couples the right to wed in any state, and said he believes religion cannot justify the rejection of their marriage.</p>\n<p>“There really isn’t a clear, justifiable reason to limit [marriage] to between a man and a woman alone,” Gee said. “I would say that you cannot use religious motivations for limiting the institution of marriage to simply a man and a woman.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Ryan T. Anderson, opponent to the Supreme Court ruling, said he supports a “conjugal vision of marriage” which presents men and women as pairs to unite as one person.</p>\n<p>“Marriage is primarily a comprehensive union of sexual complementary spouses where man and a woman unite as one flesh,” Anderson said. “The act that makes them one flesh has the capacity to create new life, and that relationship of husband and wife has the capacity to create a child with both a mother and a father.”</p>\n<p>According to Anderson, since the U.S. Constitution does not mention what concept of marriage is correct, it is up to citizens to create laws on how marriages should be governed.</p>\n<p>“The 14th Amendment to the Constitution is silent to which one of those visions is true or good or the best,” Anderson said. “And where the Constitution is silent, we the people retain constitutional authority to make laws.”</p>\n<p>Anderson said the flaw in the Supreme Court ruling was that it bypassed constitutional laws by enacting its own opinion on the nation.</p>\n<p>“It imposed that philosophy of marriage on the entire nation under the guise of constitutional law,” Anderson said. “There is no constitutional justification whatsoever by five unelected judges to say, ‘our preferred philosophy of marriage is now required of all fifty states simply because of our fiat.’”</p>\n<p>According to Anderson, the Supreme Court violated the Constitution and said this should be a concern for all informed Americans.</p>\n<p>If you care about constitutional, democratic self-governance, you have to care about the judicial usurpation of politics, which is what took place in Obergefell,” Anderson said.</p>\n<p>Anderson disputed Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy’s reasoning for the ruling and said the future of marriage will constantly be changed to suit different needs.</p>\n<p>“If you think about the actual arguments that Justice Kennedy made to justify his philosophy of marriage, and simply think though, what does it mean for the future of marriage? It means that marriage will simply be redefined as contract law,” Anderson said.</p>\n<p>According to Anderson, Justice Kennedy’s ruling will cause marriage to be continuously redefined in the future.</p>\n<p>“What’s the legal principle for monogamy?” Anderson said. “What prevents future redefinitions of marriage?”</p>\n<p>Anderson said the Obergefell ruling has already affected religiously based businesses and charity organizations that refuse to support the new law.</p>\n<p>“We’ve already seen in jurisdictions where marriages have been redefined where faith-based adoption agencies have been shut down, where schools are beginning to lose their accreditation,” Anderson said. “We’ve seen bakers, florists, photographers penalized not because they said they refuse to serve gay people; their only objection was to baking the same-sex wedding cake or doing the alter flowers for a same-sex marriage.”</p>\n<p>Anderson told the story of a florist who refused to create an arrangement for a same-sex wedding. The women was sued by her state, lost the first round of her legal battles and has appealed to an appellate court.</p>\n<p>“She should have a constitutional right after Obergefell not to be forced to violate her beliefs,” Anderson said. “The Supreme Court says same-sex couple have a right to get marriage, but that doesn’t place a duty upon anyone else to help celebrate that way.”</p>\n<p>Anderson said he hopes there will be a way to discuss the issue and reach a conclusion in a respectful manner.</p>\n<p>“How do we agree to disagree about marriage without persecuting one another, without using the government as a blunt force to impose our values on others?” Anderson said.</p>\n<p>Second-year history and psychology double major Iridian Magallon said before the debate, she was interested to see how Anderson would argue against same-sex marriage without relying on religion.</p>\n<p>“I was really curious as to what the arguments [Anderson] would propose, because I always thought the main argument against same sex marriage was religion,” Magallon said. “So I was curious how he was going to argue without using religion.”</p>\n<p>Magallon said she was surprised that Anderson argued his opinion well, but ultimately agreed with Professor Gee.</p>\n<p>“It was interesting that he was able to argue that side pretty well,” Magallon said. “[In the end], I was still on [Gee’s] side.”</p>\n<p>According to second-year economics and accounting major Andrew Gates, the Supreme Court ruling was unconstitutional and denied state’s rights.</p>\n<p>“The decision of Obergefell was an issue of state’s rights, and I do believe the Supreme Court was engaging in judicial fiat or judicial activism, in that they were not concerned about what the Constitution said about marriage, but rather what they believed,” Gates said. “The issue is that do the states have the right to choose should same-sex marriage be allowed, and I fully believe they should.”</p>\n<p>Gates said he was originally opposed to the Obergefell ruling and believes the Supreme Court was not justified in its action because the federal government involved itself in a state issue.</p>\n<p>“I was against the Supreme Court ruling, and I’m still against it,” Gates said. “Personally, I don’t have any problem with the state legalizing same sex marriage, but the issue is, ‘do you believe in self-governance in a constitutional republic?’ If you do, you would recognize the state right to define marriage is the state’s right, and the federal government should not interfere.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
