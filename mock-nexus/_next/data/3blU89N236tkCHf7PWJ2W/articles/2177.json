The Public and Mental Health Commission was approved for $26,000 for this year, according to Kaayal.</p>\n<p>“Around $10,000 is specifically for the Mental Health Conference,” he said. The rest of the money would be allocated toward honoraria, marketing and projects.</p>\n<p>In the past, the Mental Health Planning Committee, an independent entity, has planned the annual Mental Health Conference. This year, the Public and Mental Health Commission plans on helping the committee.</p>\n<p>The executive board of the Public and Mental Health Commission will have a conference coordinator position dedicated to Mental Health Conference planning, according to Kaayal.</p>\n<p>The executive board will also include co-chairs, policy analysts, a mental health special projects coordinator, a public health special projects coordinator, a nontraditional first generation representative, an event/program director, a QTPOC representative, a financial coordinator and a marketing outreach director among others.</p>\n<p>Kaayal plans to be one of the co-chairs alongside Bongi Makatini, a fourth-year biological sciences major and Spanish minor.</p>\n<p>Makatini reached out to Kaayal after seeing the work he was doing regarding mental and public health. After the resolution passed in March 2018, Kaayal and Makatini came together during Spring Quarter 2018 and worked on the commission over the summer.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t want to step on the toes of the great work that’s already been done on campus, but we really wanted to see A.S. taking more of a stand to try to help tackle different issues regarding mental health here on campus,” Makatini said.</p>\n<p>The Committee on Committees already approved Kaayal and Makatini for the co-chair positions and submitted the two appointments to A.S. President Brooke Kopel.</p>\n<p>Kopel has sent those appointments to A.S. Senate, and A.S. Senate now must vote in favor of the appointments. The Senate must also approve all other executive board appointments.</p>\n<p>Even though the executive board has yet to be approved, Kaayal and Makatini have started planning prospective projects.</p>\n<p>One of the projects involves free flu shots for UCSB students, according to Kaayal. The project would be funded by the commission.</p>\n<p>“We’re also working with student health and library administration and custodial services to start placing hand sanitizer dispensers around campus,” Kaayal said.</p>\n<p>“We’re starting to target the library first and then hopefully branch that out to the UCen and lecture halls.”</p>\n<p>Makatini mentioned the toll the quarter system takes on the mental health of UCSB students, and how students who never had mental health problems prior to college “all of a sudden have anxiety or depression or any other mental health disorders.”</p>\n<p>“We really want to make sure that students have a central voice through Associated Students to be able to utilize these different resources,” Makatini said.</p>\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

We felt that it was important for her to come to campus and talk about her experience,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>Cullors, an activist and artist, spoke prominently about the origins of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>\n<p>She discussed how the acquittal of Neighborhood Watch Coordinator George Zimmerman after his killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin caused outrage among those in the black community and beyond.</p>\n<p>“It was a response, it was a guttural response to one of our tragedies of our generation,” Cullors said.</p>\n<p>She condemned Zimmerman’s trial and subsequent acquittal, stating Zimmerman’s defense “[tried] to build a defense that Trayvon Martin deserved to die.”</p>\n<p>Cullors, a native of San Fernando Valley, also spoke about growing up in a community which resented the police and intimately felt the effects of mass incarceration. She highlighted the paradoxes in the American justice system, exemplified by Zimmerman’s not-guilty verdict.</p>\n<p>“I sat with a contradiction of living in a country that has two million people in prison, one million of them black and George Zimmerman, a white-passing Latino, gets to kill a human being and go home free.”</p>\n<p>Fellow activist Alicia Garza’s subsequent coinage of the term “Black Lives Matter” in a Facebook post, and Cullors’ decision to attach a hashtag to it in a post expressing her frustration, led to #BlackLivesMatter becoming a viral phenomenon – and later, a tangible social movement.</p>\n<p>However, Cullors emphasized the continuity of the Black Lives Matter movement with regards to the past.</p>\n<p>“This concept of Black Lives Matter has lineage. It’s a part of the Black Power Movement,” she said. “We stand on the shoulders of giants.”</p>\n<p>Cullors emphasized the importance of becoming involved with issues beyond the confines of social media and fostering relationships with other organizations, such as the Women’s March and the #MeToo movement.</p>\n<p>“Contrary to the media, a hashtag doesn’t start an actual movement. It takes skills, it takes organizing, it takes commitment and it takes sacrifice,” she said.</p>\n<p>For those within the MCC, Cullors’ talk surpassed already-high expectations.</p>\n<p>MCC Program Coordinator Abire Sabbagh expressed relief that Cullors didn’t avoid sensitive topics and instead tackled touchy subjects with grace and eloquence.</p>\n<p>“We’re not going to sugarcoat anything. We’re going to talk about the struggles and we’re going to talk about how hard it is, but we’re also going to talk about what we do and how we build the movement that we need to liberate ourselves,” Sabbagh said.</p>\n<p>Khan-Marcus also admired Cullors’ ability to bring light to the issues by talking about her own personal experiences and how a sense of community and family gave Cullors a refuge from suffering.</p>\n<p>“She talked about all the hardship she went through as a child, but there’s also a sense of love,” Khan-Marcus said. “I’m absolutely thrilled. Her presence itself was incredible.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

resolution, authored by Senator Zion Solomon and seconded by Senator Christian Ornelas, also called for the Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors to reject any and all future oil drilling proposals in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“I’m bringing this issue to Senate because I believe Associated Students can be used as an important platform to use to lobby legislatures [sic] within the community,” Solomon stated in an email to the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>This project includes three separate oil drilling proposals in the Cat Canyon Oil Field, located in northern Santa Barbara county near Santa Maria.</p>\n<p>The first <a href=\"http://www.sbcountyplanning.org/energy/projects/WestCatCanyon.asp\">proposal</a>, from the Texas-based ERG Operating Company, would add new injection wells, drilling pads and processing facilities, as well as expand current pads.</p>\n<p>In the second <a href=\"http://www.sbcountyplanning.org/energy/projects/AERAEastCatCanyon.asp\">proposal</a>, the Shell and ExxonMobil company AERA would drill new oil wells via “steam fracking.”</p>\n<p>The third <a href=\"http://www.sbcountyplanning.org/energy/projects/PetroRockUCCB.asp#documents\">proposal</a> by PetroRock would also add new steam injection wells.</p>\n<p>In total, the project would add more than 750 new intensive oil wells in Cat Canyon, <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/los-padres/santa-barbara/fighting-fracking-and-extreme-oil\">according</a> to the Santa Barbara chapter of the Sierra Club.</p>\n<p>The resolution also calls on both Associated Students (A.S.) Senate members and Boards, Committees and Units (BCUs) with environmental mission statements — including the Environmental Affairs Board, Human Rights Board and Coastal Fund — to write letters to the Board of Supervisors declaring their opposition.</p>\n<p>The resolution also asks Chancellor Henry T. Yang to “reaffirm his previous commitments against fossil fuels” by issuing a statement against the project.</p>\n<p>“[The resolution] will both pressure our elected officials on a bigger scale and give environmental lobbyists more weight when they’re talking to the Board of Directors making this decision,” Solomon stated in an email to the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday’s meeting, the resolution’s student sponsors — fourth-year environmental studies and Chicana and Chicano studies major Amanda Pantoja and second-year computer science major Dylan Kupsh — both emphasized the importance of students speaking out and signing petitions against the proposals.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the supervisors got in because of student efforts, so we want them to hear what we have to say,” Pantoja said. “UCSB itself is one of the greenest campuses. I want to ensure we reflect our green values in the community.”</p>\n<p>Pantoja pointed out during the meeting that the Cat Canyon Proposals contradict California State Senate bill <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB100\">100</a>, which puts California on the path for 100 percent fossil fuel-free electricity by 2045.</p>\n<p>“Going with these projects would go against what Santa Barbara and Goleta have voted for,” she added.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors will vote on these measures in early 2019, according to Kupsh.
