The same feeling happened for me last year when we [started] Sunfest and students showed up!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SunFest, nicknamed “A Warm Up for the WarmUp,” is a festival hosted in Storke Plaza from 3  p.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday and was put together for the first time last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our biggest hope is that students are safe and they have choices,” Armistead added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead also wrote that many of the alternative events were planned in “close consultation” with students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeike Meijer, who serves as the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) within Associated Students, said her office was particularly focused on education when preparing for Deltopia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In coordination with the Alcohol and Drug Program, the office put together naloxone trainings for students to learn how to respond to opiod overdoses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer said her office also partnered with SBSO and UCPD to host a Pizza with the Police event at Woodstock’s Pizza from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Thursday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday, the EVPLA office will host a town hall at Pardall Center from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. for community members to debrief Deltopia and discuss any concerns they might have had. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We basically just tried to fill up this week with as many events as possible in the spirit of education and prevention and providing resources,” Meijer said. This is the first time the EVPLA office has put together a prevention week, she said, and she hopes that the next EVPLA will continue to grow the initiative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer has also been working with UCIV, a volunteer program to assist students when they’re out and about during Deltopia, to set up the hydration stations in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), said he appreciates the work the student-led initiative has done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am a big supporter of UCIV. I see the program as a valuable way that students have taken more responsibility over the IV community, and promoted a culture of greater safety during large events,” Brandt wrote in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt himself has volunteered with UCIV in the past, and has “enjoyed seeing the love and appreciation from students when we have handed out water, snacks, and condoms.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking on Deltopia as a whole, Brandt echoed sentiments by Hoover, Armistead and Meijer that keeping I.V. safe is a community effort. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over the past few years, the trend towards fewer arrests and citations that we’ve seen are a testament to the work that students, law enforcement, and the community have done to try to change the culture in IV,” he wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer agreed, attributing the improvements in safety to the sheer number of organizations working together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a lot of different people who are making an effort to have Deltopia be safe and have it be local, and have it be like a community event,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it’s safe and it’s local, then everyone who’s there is truly caring about the community because it’s our home. No one wants to make a mess in their own home.”</span></p>\n<p><i>Sofia Mejias-Pascoe contributed reporting.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-86992\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The union last went on strike on March. 20. <em>Devin Ralston / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The unfair labor practice charge, filed by American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) 3229, alleges that the University of California attempted to stifle the union’s “ability to strike, to silence its voice, and to diminish its ranks,” according to the document submitted to the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) on Monday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PERB is the government agency responsible for regulating the bargaining statuses for public schools, universities, public employees and other government employees, according to the agency’s <a href=\"https://www.perb.ca.gov\">website</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The charge claims that UC violated the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act, which protects UC workers’ rights to unionize and allows collective bargaining to negotiate their own wages, benefits and working conditions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a systemic pattern of intimidation and creating an atmosphere of fear in the workplace,” AFSCME spokesperson John de los Angeles said to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the most recent incidents happened during the UC campus-wide union strike on March 20, during which workers received citations from police, a consequence of protesting that workers had not previously experienced from UC, said de los Angeles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The workers] were hitting the picket line, making noise, but they always do and all of a sudden UCPD is now threatening them with police citations,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For them to change that expectation…  [creates] a sense of hesitance for some of our workers to come forward, voice concerns and even participate in these activities.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The filing lists examples of UC’s alleged failure to protect workers’ rights to protest, such as “workplace retaliation and police citation” and “</span><span

the first and only organization to express interest in the space as of December 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, Bagel Cafe, Mojo Teahouse, the Isla Vista Trading Post and Off-Campus Senator Sydney Karmes-Wainer have reached out to Gary Lawrence], University Center (UCen) director, to ask about the space. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would say that all of the inquiries have been informal and of the “information gathering” type,” Lawrence said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD previously said that if they submitted a proposal for the space, they would be primarily interested in using it as a Community Service Organization (CSO) station. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This space could enable the UC Police Department and its members to more effectively and routinely interact with the campus community in non-enforcement contacts,” UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-08/kaplan-ends-ucen-contract-ucpd-eyes-vacated-space/\">said</a> in December. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the difficulties in filling the space is that it does not have a kitchen, but instead a classroom, which may rule out food-based businesses. </span></p>\n<p><b>MOJO TEAHOUSE</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mojo Teahouse owner Boxi Wang said that if Mojo Teahouse was selected for the space, they would only serve drinks. The location in Isla Vista serves drinks in addition to food items such as popcorn chicken. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“From my understanding, it’s a pretty cool thing to sell boba at school. I’ve been to some campuses, but I don’t think [any] of them sell boba on campus,” Wang said. “They all have coffee and other alternatives, like let’s say Jamba Juice, over there, but they don’t have anything that’s like more towards Asians.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plus, having a location on campus would allow Mojo Teahouse to pick up some morning sales that they miss out on by being in I.V., Wang added. </span></p>\n<p><b>BAGEL CAFE</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bagel Cafe Manager Jacob Root said that he had reached out to ask about a space in the UCen in late December or early January, but was told that there weren’t any available spaces at the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re looking to put a satellite-type location out there,” Root said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We would definitely need to make it semi-kitchen ready because we would want to bake bagels fresh over there,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Root hasn’t been able to check out the location yet, however, and said that he was waiting to hear back from Lawrence about the space. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’d have to look at the space, like I said, I just don’t know how many square feet it is, where the location is,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><b>ISLA VISTA TRADING POST</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Trading Post co-president Julia Rose Feldman said the organization has been looking for a permanent space for a while, especially since they are outgrowing their current storage space in another member’s garage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Right now we have just been working with our event-based model, which is great for what it is, but we’ve kind of outgrown the model,” Feldman, a fourth-year environmental studies major, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At a few of our events we weren’t able to have the event for as long as we said we would because we just didn’t have anything to give out,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having the permanent space would allow the I.V. Trading Post to keep more donations as well as create a space on campus where “where [students] know that the clothes [they donate] are going to be going to another loving home.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are excited about the potential opportunity to have the space, but due to limited funding i’m not exactly sure if it’s going to be at all possible,” Feldman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We haven’t heard back about how much it’s going to cost, and as a relatively new organization, we have about $2,000 to our org’s name, so we’re not sure whether or not it’s even feasible.”</span></p>\n<p><b>SENATOR KARMES-WAINER</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karmes-Wainer reached out to inquire about potentially putting a hot food bar in the space. She put out a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/\">petition</a> calling for a hot food bar on campus in January and has since been working in Senate to try to make it a reality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need a proper arrangement where students can build their own healthy meals, like a build-a-bowl hot bar with options for a clean protein, roasted vegetables, whole grains, &amp; healthy fats,” Karmes-Wainer wrote in the original <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/university-of-california-santa-barbara-ucsb-healthy-hot-bar\">petition</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karmes-Wainer declined to comment about the potential leasing of the space until she had more information. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vacant UCen space is currently occupied by the UCSB’s Housing, Dining and Auxiliary Services (HDAE) after its main office was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-02/housing-services-plants-new-roots-in-ucen-following-tree-damage/\">damaged</a> by an early February storm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lawrence said HDAE would be in the vacant UCen space for approximately two to four months, but that he didn’t anticipate their occupancy having any effect on future rentals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HDAE is currently paying the standard rate while it uses the space. Kaplan paid $4,420 per month to rent the space. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

This is the first year the RCSGD has hosted a Trans Week of Visibility, offering events and resources across the week in observation.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87108\" style=\"width: 1948px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/?attachment_id=87108\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-87108\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87108\" data-attachment-id=\"87108\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/rcsgd-celebrates-first-trans-week-of-visibility/screen-shot-2019-04-03-at-7-22-08-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-03-at-7.22.08-PM.png?fit=1938%2C1284&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1938,1284\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-04-03 at 7.22.08 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-03-at-7.22.08-PM.png?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-03-at-7.22.08-PM.png?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-87108\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-03-at-7.22.08-PM.png?resize=888%2C588\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"588\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-03-at-7.22.08-PM.png?w=1938&amp;ssl=1 1938w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-03-at-7.22.08-PM.png?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-03-at-7.22.08-PM.png?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-03-at-7.22.08-PM.png?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-03-at-7.22.08-PM.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-87108\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The center also partnered with Richie’s Barber Shop in I.V. for a Beat and Barber event, where the shop provided free, gender-affirming haircuts. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Due to the current anti-trans sociopolitical climate, i</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t is more vital than ever that we stand in solidarity with our trans community,” Solis said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The RCSGD wanted to expand the day into a week because, historically, LGBTQ centers and queer spaces, in general, have excluded trans people, especially those who fall on the intersection of other marginalized communities.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The week began with a Trans Resource Fair in Manzanita Village to provide transgender students with more information about resources available to them on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because many students have been misgendered and deadnamed at home, college settings are when they can be their most authentic selves, Solis said. They recounted how excited some students were about the visibility of the trans flags at the fair. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[That excitement] was really affirming for us, as the RCSGD, who has been working really diligently and providing trans visibility on campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center is also hosting several workshops throughout the week on interpersonal violence and sexual violence. Students will be able to attend discussions in a safe space to talk about their identities and personal experiences, along with issues facing their communities, Solis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The RCSGD will be offering resources and paperwork for students who wish to legally change their name and/or gender on Friday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The week will be ending with the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fourth annual Transgender Day of Visibility Celebration, sponsored by the Santa Barbara Transgender Advocacy Network</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aryn Amezcua, a third-year UCSB student and Trans Task Force Advocacy Coordinator for the RCSGD, said the week has had a great impact on the community so far. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The people who come through, they thank us. They’re like, ‘We really like this, we needed this,’” Amezcua said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center also partnered with Richie’s Barber Shop in Isla Vista for a Beat and Barber event, where the shop provided free, gender-affirming haircuts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m familiar with the movement and I support it and I wanted to show my support. Everyone’s been really happy about it,” said Richie Ramirez, owner of Richie’s Barber Shop.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other businesses such as gc2b also worked with RCSGD to show support for the community. Gc2b, a trans-owned company dedicated to providing safe binding options for trans masculine people, donated eight chest binders to be given out as raffle prizes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The RCSGD managed to organize a large week of events due to the dedication of passionate people [students and staff] who wanted to create a vibrant and welcoming campus for the trans community,” Solis said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope this week creates momentum for other UCSB programs, departments, and student organizations to ask within their own spaces if trans students, faculty, and staff are represented and have a voice.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB as a whole has been working on fostering more support for transgender students, according to Solis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) recently introduced a new support group dedicated to trans and non-binary issues and experiences. The group, called TRANSformative, allows members to discuss issues related to transitioning, misgendering, bodies, relationships, medical care, transphobia and general life topics, according to the C.A.P.S. website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solis finds that UCSB has taken strides to create resources tailored to the trangender community but continually hears from students that more all-inclusive restrooms, medical access and curriculum are needed to support the community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think more access to healthcare would be great, especially for trans students it can be very expensive. We don’t have the insurance and that’s already a huge setback,” Amezcua said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amezcua believes more pronoun awareness and training is needed for professors and teaching assistants in classroom settings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hopefully, we can expand [Trans Week] into a month next year with more planning and more collaborations. It’s just going to get bigger and better from here,” Solis said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
