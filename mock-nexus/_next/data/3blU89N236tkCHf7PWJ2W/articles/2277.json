CSD), will allow individuals to borrow one of the 1,200 bicycles that will be available.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are approximately 20,000 registered bicycles within UCSB and I.V.’s two square miles, according to the Associated Students Bicycle Committee.</p>\n<p>Matt Dobberteen, alternative transport manager from the Santa Barbara Public Works department, presented the program to the I.V. CSD alongside Mo Lovegreen, UCSB director of campus sustainability, on Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking at a potential launch date of June 25, 2018, for the first allocation of 600 bikes in the area,” Dobberteen said.</p>\n<p>Following the first launch date, an additional 600 bikes will arrive in August, he explained.</p>\n<p>Each bike has an individual GPS tracking unit and bike lock attached, according to Dobberteen. This eliminates the need for a bike rack and lowers the chances of theft.</p>\n<p>Currently, the I.V. CSD is trying to find parking spaces for the bicycles.</p>\n<p>Every CSD board member supported the program, but a few members expressed skepticism about the program not having a permanent bike rack for students to park in.</p>\n<p>CSD Director Jay Freeman questioned how students would be prevented from leaving the bikes piled up on the side of the street.</p>\n<p>Dobberteen said watching the flow of bikes and where they end up will be an important learning tool.</p>\n<p>“If there are heaps of bikes all over, we have failed,” he said.</p>\n<p>Dobberteen said potential solutions include giving students incentives to return bikes to a designated location in the evening or hiring a company that would park the bicycles in a designated location during the night.</p>\n<p>Lovegreen added that UCSB’s Department of Campus Sustainability also has plans to start a new outreach program for the bike sharing service starting next week. The program is directed at incoming freshmen in an attempt to persuade them to not bring their own bikes.</p>\n<p>The board of directors said the central problem with the program is finding the space for the bikes and persuading students to use the bikes in a respectful manner.</p>\n<p>“This is about us bringing high quality transportation to the community, and if we are respectful, it benefits everyone,” Dobberteen added.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the April 26 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82733\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/bike-sharing-program-soon-to-reach-isla-vista-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82733\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/bike-sharing-program-soon-to-reach-isla-vista-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/bike-sharing-program-soon-to-reach-isla-vista-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/bike-sharing-program-soon-to-reach-isla-vista-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/bike-sharing-program-soon-to-reach-isla-vista-ucsb/","id":2276,"author":{"id":83,"name":"Luke Dorsey"},"related":[2275,2274,2273],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Associated Students Elections 2018","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Facts-UCSB-Campus-by-Olivia-Consterdine-PRINT-2-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Facts-UCSB-Campus-by-Olivia-Consterdine-PRINT-2-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The official ballot will be available on G.O.L.D.  from April 23 to April 26.

From bottom left to right, Jeike Meijer, Steven Ho, Justice Dumlao and Madeline Loudon.<em> Jose Ochoa, Tamari Dzotsenidze / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Sunday night, Brooke Kopel, the candidate for A.S. president running with Campus United (CU), released a statement on Facebook denouncing the ballot measure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to be very clear: students should not have to pay a penny more in student fees for a new UCen,” the statement said. “The UCen as it exists has so many problem [sic]: it’s old, crowded, and it needs renovation- just like tons of other buildings on our campus. This isn’t because student fees are too low, it’s because California refuses to invest in public education.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement was released a couple of hours before voting officially opened on G.O.L.D. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Kopel said she wanted to be as transparent as possible with students and she believes that students pay the most attention right before voting starts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s why I wanted to release it at that point, not to get any last minute votes or as a way to put myself up in the elections, but rather to reach as many students as possible when they’re paying attention,” Kopel said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CU executive candidates Sophia Dycaico, the candidate for Executive Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA), Madeline Loudon, the candidate for Executive Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) and Anthony Pimentel, the candidate for Internal Vice President (IVP), all confirmed they agree with Kopel’s statement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dycaico said she had always denounced the raising of student fees to renovate the UCen. Both Dycaico and Kopel told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Monday they believed an official statement was necessary to dispel rumours that Campus United supported the “NewCen” measure as a party.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many candidates support the renovation of the UCen; however, they disagree with raising student fees to complete the renovation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that funding should be coming from the state and the UC system and should definitely not be placed as a burden on students,” Loudon said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeike Meijer, the candidate for EVPLA with the Isla Vista Party, said that making students pay for the UCen sets a precedent for students paying for all on-campus renovations.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All four candidates running for executive positions with the Isla Vista Party also confirmed they do not support the raising of student fees to renovate the UCen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of them denounced the project before election season began, including Justice Dumlao, the IVP candidate for A.S. president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While I’m very glad that she finally is coming out in being against the NewCen project, I think it was just a little late,” Dumlao said. “I’m a little sad that it was late, but better late than never.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said he thought Kopel could have been more open about the fact that she was questioning her position on the NewCen project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao added that he believes Kopel might have felt she could not express her opinions on the ballot measure, as Hieu Le, the current A.S. President and main proponent of the “NewCen” project, ran with Campus United and is affiliated with the same party as Kopel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t want to pin it all on Brooke… I imagine it’s very difficult to denounce something that your current elected president is doing,” Dumlao said. “‘Better late than never’ is how I feel. There’s so many other circumstances that Brooke could have been under or pressured under.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked why she took a stance on the ballot so late in the election season, Kopel said she wanted to gather as much information as possible before making a decision and said she felt as though new facts were coming out about the UCen proposal everyday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I actually wanted to wait as long as I could to hear the most opinions I could,” Kopel added. “That is my job, to understand everybody’s ultimate sentiments toward this project.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mayela Morales, the candidate for External Vice President for Statewide Affairs with the Isla Vista Party, also commented on the timing of Kopel’s statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was a little disheartened to see Brooke coming out with the statement not because I don’t believe that she’s against it, but because students have been so vocal about it for a really long time,” Morales said. “I thought it was very strategic to post that right before voting started.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is always ‘better late than never,’ but I honestly think it was a little too late for her to say that,” Morales added. “I think it was a little too strategic; she could have said that a long time ago.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.
