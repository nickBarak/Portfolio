Although portrayed as a rash, attention-seeking maneuver by much of the press, the truth is actually quite the opposite. Kaepernick had been auditing classes at CAL with the guidance of doctoral candidate Ameer Hasan Loggins and reading up on the teachings of Frantz Fanon and Patricia Hill for months before the protest. Yet he was still depicted as ignorant by some and as cluelessly abrasive by many.</p>\n<p>The protest lit up the media headlines like wildfire. Here was a young black athlete shunning one of the hallmarks of both American society and the sports world to call attention to the injustices that people of color continue to face in this country, which was not unprecedented considering the actions of a sports icon such as Muhammad Ali, who refused being inducted into the army in 1967 in defense of his civil rights. But it still felt shocking.</p>\n<p>The reactions to Kaepernick’s protest were varied, from claims that he was “disrespecting the flag” to the eventual dismissal of his message because he was not a starter on his team. However, one of the most popular oppositional viewpoints was that he, and athletes as a whole, should “just stick to sports.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Athletes such as Allen Iverson and Michael Jordan have established themselves in domains that are typically considered outside the boundaries of the playing field/court. Jordan created a streetwear empire and A.I. gave countless young black and brown kids the confidence and swagger to represent themselves and their cultures unabashedly.</p>\n<p>They were not exempt from the stigma or restrictions that usually accompany emphatic expressions of blackness; however, Iverson learned the hard way when his style of dress was used as the basis for a racially tinged dress code established by the NBA at the height of his career. The fact that athletes themselves have the unique power to capture the minds of such a large audience while operating in the institution of sports (that, just like any other large institution, is marred with the racism and discrimination of its society) is reflected in the rich history of activism as well as the dark past of discrimination that has been a part of all sports since their inception.</p>\n<p>The usage of sports as a conductor for social justice is not a new or novel concept, as exemplified from the gladiator uprisings of Ancient Rome to John Carlos and Tommie Smith raising their fists at the 1968 Summer Olympics. It is not too surprising that the “stick to sports” crowd is ignorant of just how antithetical that statement is to the core of what sports are or have been. However, it is not just ignorance that compels people to spout this backward thinking. There is a deep-seated sense of pain and discomfort for many white Americans in seeing this activism that is often not talked about but is rooted in the dehumanization of the black athlete.</p>\n<p>We all mythologize athletes. Sports fans often will often talk about how basketball or football is an escape for them, a game that takes them away from the harshness of the real world. Athletes are the vessels for our hopes, our dreams, even our insecurities.</p>\n<p>We rely on their labor for our entertainment; however, when their humanity interrupts or overshadows this very same entertainment, fans face a conundrum.</p>\n<p>We must strip athletes of most of their identity or personhood because if athletes are humanized, then the illusion is shattered. Many white fans don’t want to look at the face of their favorite athlete and see blackness. I don’t mean phenotypic brown and black skin but rather the deep-seated pain of a people who have been oppressed for centuries.</p>\n<p>Michael Jordan understood this very well. As the famous story goes, when asked why he didn’t speak up more for social causes, Jordan answered, “Republicans buy sneakers, too.” When Michael Bennett or Thabo Sefolosha speaks up against the police brutality they’ve encountered, or when Kaepernick elaborates on the school-to-prison pipeline, many sports fans are forced, for the first time, to truly look at these athletes as black and at just how much that affects their lives.</p>\n<p>These athletes can no longer be everyone’s vessel, because to be a vessel is to be empty, to be neutral, and in the face of institutionalized racism and violence, neutrality is impossible. It is hard for many white fans to understand this because it is not what they were taught. Sports is supposed to be a meritocracy, a great equalizer, but the truth is that meritocracy in our current state is just another facade.</p>\n<p>The institution of sports in which one group, white men, predominantly has ownership of another group, black men, can never be equal unless it’s changed, just as the institution of politics in which one group has historically made all the laws can never be equitable as well.</p>\n<p>It then makes sense why the rallying cry is not “racism doesn’t exist” but “stick to sports,” because to admit the reality, that these black athletes are intelligent, that they do have a strong pride in their identity and that the institution of sports is not exempt but rather perpetuates the very same racism that is rampant in this country, would then force fans to disrupt the status quo, to have to take action, and for too many white fans, being comfortable is more important than working toward justice.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the biggest reason that the reaction toward kneeling and activism in sports has been so visceral and negative is not Trump, it’s not the military and “patriotism,” and it’s certainly not that athletes aren’t able to articulate their positions effectively. The reason is that, just like any other time a racial injustice is brought to the forefront of the national conversation, it is making those who find comfort in white supremacy uncomfortable. What athletes and other political activists know, however, is that change only comes from discomfort, and if “mixing” sports and politics is what is causing this discomfort, then that means we are on the right track.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Sept. 28, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/islavistacdpcalifornia\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">last census</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2010, less than three percent of Isla Vista’s 23,096 residents were under the age of 18; within that, less than 0.9 percent were under the age of three. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like the children around this area don’t really have a normal childhood as other children would have, because they live in a college town,” Joana Gutierrez, a third-year sociology major who volunteered at Haunt the Loop, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’re constricted of doing many things, especially during the holidays, because it’s not really safe for them to go out when everybody is going out and getting drunk and partying. So I feel like it’s very important that [we] as students take them out to safely trick-or-treat and show them that we care about them having a childhood.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But only a few volunteers got to answer this call. Trick-or-treating was supposed to be over a two hour period from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. last Sunday, with volunteers leading groups of children from one spot to another. The first </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and only </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> group to arrive came to the Pardall Center around 3:30 p.m. But around 4 p.m., Ornelas said the volunteer crew began packing up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s drop in numbers took organizers by surprise. Both the planning and the event itself were based entirely off of last year’s report, according to Shannon Sweeney, the EVPLA chief of staff, who put the event together alongside Andy Ruiz, the EVPLA community events coordinator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can never really guess predictability on the kids’ end, just because every year it’s different </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> what they might be doing that weekend,” Ruiz said. “The businesses are always so amazing at helping out with that, being very cooperative, allowing us to invite people into their business for community betterment.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two worked from a report left by former Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) organizer Alex Young, who detailed the process in which organizers hosted the event last year. Like last year, according to Ornelas, the I.V. CSD coordinated with the EVPLA office to advertise the event with posters through I.V. Youth Projects (IVYP) and I.V. Elementary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The youth-oriented nature of the event proved to be one of the biggest challenges in planning and publicizing it, Sweeney said. While most events targeted for students are advertised through Facebook and Instagram, Haunt the Loop’s audience </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">children and their parents </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">required a different kind of grassroots approach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To tackle that, the EVPLA staff brought their posters to the I.V. CSD, who then shared it with IVYP’s Family Resource Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud said the planning process was “exactly the same as last year,” and couldn’t deduce why the turnout was significantly lower compared to Haunt the Loop in years past.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It could have been any number of things … sometimes events just don’t have a lot of people come to them. It was a great success last year; it was a lot of people. Who knows why people didn’t come this year?” Abboud said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fifteen local businesses in and around the Loop </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">including Buddha Bowls, Rockfire Grill, Cajé, Amazon and the I.V. Bicycle Boutique </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">partnered with the EVPLA office to pitch in with candy distribution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volunteers were on hand to provide candy to participating businesses, but Ornelas said many provided their own and decorated for the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With plenty of leftover candy to spare, Ornelas also is not sure what caused this year’s small turnout. Hosting the event on Sunday afternoon </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the same day as last year’s Haunt the Loop </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> likely isn’t the problem, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ruiz said the Sunday afternoon slot was chosen for safety concerns for children and for volunteers who would be difficult to schedule during the week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But with this year’s low attendance in mind, Ornelas is discussing with Sweeney and Ruiz about moving the event closer to Halloween in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas speculates that the areas to the north of I.V. are a more popular option for candy collecting as “a lot of children go trick-or-treating in the community behind FT” and as it is outside of I.V., which may be safer and more receptive to children. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of working through I.V. CSD and other organizations, Ornelas believes that in the future, the EVPLA office should be more direct in its outreach by keeping more of the workload in-house to draw the most outreach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s Haunt the Loop was a learning experience, Ornelas said, in part because the responsibility of hosting the event fell onto new shoulders, and the small showing left most involved scratching their heads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the fliers, pounds of candy and weeks of preparation, when an event doesn’t turn out the way you had it envisioned, Ornelas said: “It just sucks.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the Oct. 31, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Both Santa Barbara natives, the two Hauschild’s were used to playing with each other on the same teams in both the High School level at San Marcos and at the club level while also attending matches at UCSB’s Campus Pool.</p>\n<p>The two brothers were introduced to the sport by their younger sister who had been playing since she was 10. She is now currently a freshman at USC and is a member of the Trojans’ women’s water polo team as a driver after graduating from San Marcos High.</p>\n<p>Once introduced, Shane and Ben loved the sport and before you knew it, the Hauschild family had another connection point: water polo.</p>\n<p>“We went to try it, immediately loved it and made it our top priority so it really united all of us because we all had our different paths but water polo connected us. It definitely been a huge positive,” Shane said.</p>\n<p>“She [the sister] definitely started the water polo trend in the family and then my parents caught on, became the biggest supporters and we all then grew to love the sport immensely uniting us even more,” Ben added.</p>\n<p>With Shane being a year older, he was the first of the two to get the opportunity to go to University and continue his water polo career. In that 2014 season, Shane won the MPSF Freshman of Year after a 32-goal season while Ben led his high school team to its first league title in 20 years.</p>\n<p>What Shane accomplished his freshman year was remarkable, however, just the fact he was able to continue his water polo career at a Division-I NCAA level was incredible on its own when you consider only 2.8 percent of US High School Water Polo Players compete at NCAA I schools.</p>\n<p>Now after looking at that, it’s even more incredible to consider that the younger Hauschild was also able to get his own Division-I opportunity, opting to go to San Jose State, a school that is new to the water polo scene.</p>\n<p>“I heard it’s going to grow quickly and I could’ve gone to a more established program and do something that’s already happened,” Ben said. “Or I had this unique opportunity to come to San Jose State and work with a program, build a program and be a big name on a growing program.”</p>\n<p>After the decision was made, an even more amazing coincidence happened. UCSB, along with a few other programs, seceded from the MPSF, their former conference, and established the GCC, a conference that added San Jose State along for the ride.</p>\n<p>The move, unknowingly, set the stage not just for this Friday’s match, but last years match.</p>\n<p>Nearly one year ago to the day, the two brothers faced off for the first time ever at Campus Pool and to this day remember the feelings of that night.</p>\n<p>“I was nervous because quite honestly I didn’t know what to expect, I never had to guard him before that,” Shane said. “I didn’t know how physical it would get and I didn’t know how to go about it at all but it all went well in the end.”</p>\n<p>“It was the most anticipated match for me all season long,” Ben said. “I definitely tried to take it to another level. I didn’t want to get bested by him so there was definitely some extra adrenaline playing each other.”</p>\n<p>Not just happy that they got to play each other, Ben and Shane were also excited to be able to play in Santa Barbara, the place they grew up and the place that held all their friends and family.</p>\n<p>After the match, UCSB, a heavy favorite, came out the victor 13-7 to no one’s shock, but the brothers never shared a moment of displeasure with each other.</p>\n<p>“Even though we are supposed to be rivals I know he is still my brother. It’s more of a fun rivalry as compared to an actual competitive rivalry. We both want the best for each other,” Shane said.</p>\n<p>Even though Ben and his team came out the loser, he was never unappreciative of the fact he got to go toe-to-toe with his big brother.</p>\n<p>“I feel gratitude playing against him. I don’t feel the need to outperform him, I don’t want him to play bad or anything like that,” Ben said. “I am just trying to put on a good show and performance for my team and I know he’s going to do the same.”</p>\n<p>Like brother, like brother both Shane and Ben say playing in that Oct. 14 conference game last year at Campus Pool has been the favorite moment of their collegiate careers with both even pointing to the end of the match specifically.</p>\n<p>“Best moment was by far end of the game last year at UCSB,” Ben said. “Knowing I did my absolute best and kind of my coming out party because since then I have played my game but just playing in front of that crowd, in that pool and playing in a place I saw games at growing up was amazing.”</p>\n<p>“My favorite moment was after the game last year because we just gave each other a big hug after the match and just talked,” Shane said. “Everyone of our friends and family came up super stoked and we all reflected on the game and it was super cool.”</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to Friday’s match, which could be the last time the two ever play each other again with Shane being a senior unless they meet at the conference tournament, both brothers are looking for the win, but even more than that, both are looking to cherish what could be the end of a fun era.</p>\n<p>“I definitely want to make the most of this game,” Ben said. “With this being the last time we could play each other I am going to go all out, hope for a good result and I think it will be a good game between us.”</p>\n<p>“This could be the last time I play him and this could be the last year I even play water polo in general so I just want to have fun and cherish being at that moment playing with and against my brother,” Shane said.</p>\n<p>Of course, Ben is not particularly shy about making his goal known of hopefully being able to pull off the upset this Friday. In fact, it would be his version of a perfect ending to this brotherly trilogy.</p>\n<p>“Perfect ending would definitely be beating UCSB which had been a huge motivation for me since coming here, I couldn’t ask for anything more than to score an upset over UCSB while he [Shane] is still around,” Ben said.</p>\n<p>Getting more specific, Ben added he would like a “close one-goal game in overtime with SJSU coming out the victor with me scoring the final goal over my brother and against one of my closest friends [Justyn Barrios, UCSB’s goalkeeper] to seal the win.”</p>\n<p>On the other side, Shane has never been one to tease his brother over the fact his team has gotten the better of him twice in this rivalry but he also recognizes, winning is better than losing.</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to lie, I would be upset if we lost,” Shane laughed. “Not at him obviously but more so at myself and our team. He would probably rub it in to make me mad but it would also be a good memory. I would definitely want to get my revenge at that tournament at that point.”</p>\n<p>With that, Shane’s perfect ending to this trifecta would be as follows.</p>\n<p>“Perfect ending would be us coming out with a win but my brother comes out happy after a great game, then after the game, we hug it out, go get dinner with our parents and be happy.”</p>\n<p>No matter the outcome, no matter the whose version of a perfect ending comes true, no matter anything, the two brothers have made it clear that this game means more than just the scoreboard.</p>\n<p>The two have been connected for a long time thanks to water polo, and it’s because of water polo that they get this special platform to go head-to-head one more time.</p>\n<p>Cherishing the moment is more important for them than ever holding ill-will toward one another for something as simple as winning and losing.</p>\n<p>Because as far as this writer is concerned, both Ben and Shane Hauschild have already won at something much more important: happiness. A word that perfectly encapsulates the feelings this two share when they are in the pool whether it be with each other or against one another.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
