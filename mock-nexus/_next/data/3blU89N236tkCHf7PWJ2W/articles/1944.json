Department of Public Worms, the A.S. Food Bank and the UC Santa Barbara Sustainability Internship Program and trains students in practices that address the social, economic and environmental aspects of sustainability, according to Katie Maynard, advisor of the Edible Campus Program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the great things about a farm is it gives students an opportunity to have a hands-on connection with the natural environment and where their food comes from. Sometimes, the changes in a student’s life can be as simple as getting a better appreciation for the work that goes into creating their food,” Maynard said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opening of the farm, located on West Campus at the corner of El Colegio and Storke Road, featured a variety of booths to educate visitors on sustainability and composting, local wildlife in the area as well as providing activities for children, such as pot-painting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, Jack Johnson, singer-songwriter and UCSB alumnus, performed at the opening, singing several of his most popular songs, including “Banana Pancakes,” as well as an original song about composting to fit the theme of the event. Johnson and his wife Kim are both major donors to the project and have visited the farm to help out and check on its progress several times in the past four years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funding for the farm came from the UC Global Food Initiative, A.S. Coastal Fund, the Green Initiative Fund, the Food Security &amp; Basic Needs Taskforce, the Healthy Campus Network and the Fund for Santa Barbara Youth Making Change Board, among others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a speech at the grand opening, Chancellor Henry T. Yang emphasized that the farm will contribute to other sustainable food practices already established at UCSB and in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are working to ensure that all students have access to healthy and sustainable foods </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">⁠—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from growing food here on campus to campus food pantries [like] Associated Students Food Bank and Miramar Food Pantry to help[ing] students register for CalFresh,” Yang said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maynard said that the farm will continue to grow in the future, with plans for a total of 37 raised planter beds, ranging from 16 to 20 feet high. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Edible Campus Program is also planning on working with other departments on campus for projects using the farm, according to Maynard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[We’re] working with Dr. Chandra Krintz from the computer science department. And we’re actually going to be putting a weather station …  and collecting data that through various meters throughout the farm that computer science students can use to then make recommendations about how we may change our farming practices.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 7</em><em> of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Sweeney said that it is highly unlikely that union members would reject the contract, but if they did, the union would need to re-negotiate a contract with the UC. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweeney added that the contract will increase researchers’ job security by extending appointment times to at least a year for each researcher. Before the contract, researchers could receive appointments lasting as short as a month, reducing their ability to plan projects effectively, according to Sweeney.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC agreed to “longer term appointments, equity and salary scale smoothing adjustments for those lower on the salary scales, [and] strict merit review deadlines” Holbrook said in an email.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our goal was a multi-year agreement that recognizes the significant contributions academic researchers make to UC’s academic mission, and that’s what we’ve achieved,” said Peter Chester, the UC’s executive director of labor relations, in a press release.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the UC now requires “just cause” in order to terminate a researcher in the middle of their appointment, according to Sweeney, meaning that the UC must provide warnings and a fair investigation of a researcher’s conduct before firing a researcher. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The union was unable to secure comprehensive paid parental leave during the negotiations, but now employees may accrue sick and vacation days in order to use them consecutively as a substitution for parental leave, according to Sweeney. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Before this contract, you were only able to use those sick days in very limited ways. It had to be either you were sick or a family member was sick. Under the [new] contract, you can use them to take care of a baby,” Sweeney said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Paid parental leave increases employee satisfaction, increases retention of women at the university, increases productivity. The costs of it are basically negligible because people end up staying longer. We think it’s really a win-win to expand this.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, a joint committee between the union and the university will explore options to fund paid parental leave and create bridge funding, according to Holbrook. Bridge funding is a form of financing meant to cover immediate, short-term concerns until a method for longer-term funding is found. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While ARU and UAW 5810 settled their contracts relatively amicably with the university, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 3299, which represents UC health care and service workers, is striking and will hold a walkout on Nov. 13 due to allegations of violations of state labor laws.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People form[ed] a union because they felt that, as researchers, they could do better work if they had more workplace protections,” Sweeney said. “Better working conditions leads to better research.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91010\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-04/academic-researchers-united-uc-announce-tentative-two-year-contract/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91010\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-04/academic-researchers-united-uc-announce-tentative-two-year-contract/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-04/academic-researchers-united-uc-announce-tentative-two-year-contract/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-04/academic-researchers-united-uc-announce-tentative-two-year-contract/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-04/academic-researchers-united-uc-announce-tentative-two-year-contract/","id":1943,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[1942,1941,1940],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Real Talk Program Returns to Dorms for Second Year","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-11-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Dorms_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Dorms_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Real Talk program works toward creating spaces open for free-flowing discussions on a variety of topics including, but not limited to, race and gender.

While the Multicultural Awareness Program appointed coordinators in each residence hall to facilitate discussion programs, the Real Talk program will instead work toward creating spaces open for free-flowing discussions on a variety of topics including, but not limited to, race and gender, rather than keeping the focus on education-based programming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duane “Deejay” Johnson, chair of the Real Talk program, explained that the Multicultural Awareness program was created in the 1980s, and in the past few years, staff noticed there was “lack of knowledge” regarding marginalized groups in the older program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now, in 2019, people… have access to more knowledge surrounding race, sexuality, etc,” Johnson said. He added that Real Talk took inspiration from other programs such as Jada Pinkett Smith’s Red Table Talk, a Facebook Watch show. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Johnson, the Real Talk program was established as a way for students to comfortably talk about different topics such as “race and [the] social norms of living in this society.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program is designed to not ignore the educational component of teaching students in the residence halls about multiculturalism, but instead, give students the opportunity to talk about their own experiences, teach each other and create open dialogues surrounding different topics that affect all of our everyday lives,” James Forrester, a student leadership program advisor, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forrester views the Real Talk program as a chance for students to hold meaningful conversations that spark new perspectives “using key communication skills.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Assistant Resident Directors supervise each residence hall’s individual program and each have their own goals for it, according to Felipe Recinos Quant, Manzanita Village’s assistant resident director.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My main goal is for RTs to become bigger in attendance. Of course, quality over quantity but I would love for discussions about social justice to continue to grow,” Recinos Quant said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want there to continue to be a safe space available for the Manzi community to have discussions on social justice issues that are at times somewhat taboo to talk about.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first year of the Real Talk program was focused on tackling the “-isms” — such as racism, sexism and ableism, according to Johnson. But Johnson found that the program still felt constricting —  the point was for the conversations to be free-flowing. Now, facilitators are trained not to give their personal opinions, but instead to guide conversations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Real Talk has a motto: they do the before, during and the continuing. Before consists of checking themselves — are they able to deliver this, are they able to educate on this topic, do they hold personal biases?” Johnson said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During the session [the facilitators] set ground rules and look for signs in the audience of anger, discomfort, frustration. The continuing involves continuously asking questions and reminding the group of the facts.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facilitators are trained before beginning their programs and have separate planning sessions to research and plan for their upcoming Real Talks, according to Forrester. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though there are many components to this program and its predecessor, the overall intention remains the same, Johnson said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My hope is that students attend, engage — even with those who have different ideas in these spaces and talk these things out and hear these things out. Real Talk provides a space to ask questions and feel supported in the presence of their peers.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

I thought this was a good way to mesh the two and make a difference in the world using art.”</p>\n<p>On the court, Sullberg dominates as a starting middle blocker for the Gauchos. In her two seasons at UCSB, she has recorded 188 saves and 216 kills.</p>\n<p>Off the court, Sullberg finds her passion as an art major, and aspires to be an art therapist.</p>\n<p>“I think that being a student athlete has made me thrive in a busy schedule and learn how to balance my time,” Sullberg said. “That is one of the reasons why I think I am really able to get things going and make decisions and motivate myself to do this.”</p>\n<p>After accumulating over 4,000 dollars in arts supplies and raising 900 dollars via GoFundMe, Supply &amp; Create is looking to expand its impact by introducing on-campus drop boxes for UCSB students to donate their own art supplies to the cause. In addition, Sullberg hopes to eventually take this idea and turn it into a UCSB campus organization to create more positive change in the art education of Santa Barbara youth.</p>\n<p>Along with Sullberg, her volleyball teammate, sophomore outside hitter and libero Ali Spindt, is also actively involved with Supply &amp; Create. In the 2014 season, Spindt topped the conference leaderboard week after week in total digs and digs per set, ending her season averaging 2.81 digs per set and totaling 315.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really important for kids to have the opportunity to express themselves artistically, and this was such a great idea from [Sullberg],” Spindt said. “It’s very rewarding.”</p>\n<p>In hopes to use the large number of resources the organization is exposed to due to its closeness with the UCSB athletics program, Sullberg and Spindt plan to use UCSB’s Student-Athlete Advisory Board to encourage participation from other Gaucho athletes.</p>\n<p>“This helps us because we can have a lot more resources,” Spindt said. “Having access to all the teams definitely helps a lot. We just put the bins out and we are trying to really get this going this quarter.”</p>\n<p>Most recently, the organization has received a donation of carpet squares from Art From Scrap, a Santa Barbara-based arts organization. Sullberg and Spindt plan to incorporate this donation into a “special projects” aspect of the program and allow students to work with all types of art media to further inspire creativity.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to get people on board,” Sullberg said. “Anyone that is interested in helping in any way would be awesome.”</p>\n<p>The recently added on-campus drop boxes can be found at the SRB, UCEN and ICA Building, as well as other potential locations. Supply &amp; Create is seeking help from the UCSB community. Students interested in being a part of this organization can contact Sullberg and Spindt at artistallie@yahoo.com.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of April 9, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62209\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/ucsb-volleyball-players-use-art-to-help-community/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62209\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/ucsb-volleyball-players-use-art-to-help-community/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/ucsb-volleyball-players-use-art-to-help-community/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/ucsb-volleyball-players-use-art-to-help-community/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/ucsb-volleyball-players-use-art-to-help-community/","id":1941,"author":{"id":320,"name":"Sarah Stigers"},"related":[1940,1939,1938],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
