Jerry Brown in Oct. 2017, would allow California residents three options for their gender on their driver’s licenses and birth certificates: male, female and nonbinary, which is denoted by an ‘x.’</p>\n<p>The law fully goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2019, but the Trump administration’s attempts to redefine gender could override the state law.</p>\n<p>“If the federal government were to change that definition it could really impact all of the progress that has been made,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>On UCSB’s campus, students would not see any effects to the protections they are already afforded by the university and the state of California.</p>\n<p>“UCSB has a nondiscrimination policy, and there are a set of protected classes who are legally protected in the state of California… so someone cannot be discriminated against in accessing housing or employment based on their gender, gender identity or gender expression,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>“So our nondiscrimination policy, which aligns with those protected classes here in the state of California, would not be impacted or affected.”</p>\n<p>The Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) is currently working on two efforts to support transgender students on campus: first, by providing a community-building space for trans students on campus and second, by implementing policy changes within the university.</p>\n<p>Currently, the center is working on cataloging the number and location of all-gender restrooms on campus. They are also trying to expand the preferred name option on Gaucho On-Line Data (G.O.L.D.) to include pronouns.</p>\n<p>According to Leets, there are approximately 70 all-gender restrooms on campus, with the majority of those being single-stall restrooms.</p>\n<p>Through the RCSGD’s work to establish a map of all-gender restrooms on campus, it has identified a corridor on Ocean Road by the Gevirtz Graduate School of Education and Robertson Gym where there are several buildings without a single all-gender restroom.</p>\n<p>“If a student is in one of those classes, one of those buildings or they have multiple classes in those buildings, it’s really hard for them to find a restroom space that’s close enough by for them to get between classes or for them to go during a class,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>Ideally, Leets would like to establish several all-gender restrooms in all buildings on campus, but says the more realistic goal is at least one in every building “so a student or faculty or staff-person would not have to leave the building that they’re in to have an accessible restroom option.”</p>\n<p>The RCSGD is currently in the inventory phase of the project. Once it identifies priority spots, like the Ocean Road corridor, it will begin requesting funding and approval to convert existing restrooms to all-gender restrooms.</p>\n<p>Leets said the center is also working with the university to expand the preferred name option already available for students.</p>\n<p>For students who have not or cannot change their legal name, they can currently change their preferred name on G.O.L.D. This change will be reflected in numerous locations including their access card, GauchoSpace, G.O.L.D., advising records, the online campus directory and housing rosters.</p>\n<p>“In many places, students will be able to see their preferred name and not have to interact with their legal name. That system is pretty good; we’re just trying to make sure it’s as good as it needs to be,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>As a partner project, they are also working toward including pronouns in the university system in the same places the preferred name already appears.</p>\n<p>Despite the work they’ve already done, projects like these often take longer than the center hopes them to.</p>\n<p>“I think many people want to do that work [to support trans students] and are excited to do that work … The challenge that comes from any large organization [is], ‘Is the money there?’, ‘What’s the technical complications of making these changes,’” he said.</p>\n<p>Leets said the center works closely with Vice Chancellor Margaret Klawunn and Associate Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Maria Herrera-Sobek.</p>\n<p>“Our role on campus is to be the leaders of the advocacy and improvement on campus for trans students,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>“[The administration is] supporting the work that we are doing and help[s] us to make movement when we can’t ourselves to try and make campus more welcoming for trans students.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Senate because of academic senate clause.</p>\n<p>“In 66 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 252 (1983), it is concluded that the meetings of an academic senate of [colleges] are subject to the open meeting requirements of the Brown Act,” Safadi said to the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>“[Academic senate is] a blanket statement that covers all forms of legislation in universities… that is what I understood it to say,” she added. “Furthermore, the Brown Act is directly referred to in the [A.S.] legal code and thus associated students has subjected itself to its bylaws.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week’s closed session was unusual in that Senate asked A.S.

She confirmed she is living off campus rather than on campus.</p>\n<p>As an on-campus senator, Salari is required to “live amongst [her] constituents during Fall, Winter and Spring Quarters of their year of elective service,” according to Article II Section 1(B)(4) of the Associated Students (A.S.) legal code.</p>\n<p>Salari said she intended to live on campus when she ran for the position, but cited financial burdens as the reason she was unable to.</p>\n<p>“I am an on-campus senator, and I know a lot of people are, I guess, upset about the fact that I’m living off campus,” Salari said during the meeting.</p>\n<p>“When I got elected for it, and because of some financial issues, I wasn’t able to [live on campus]. As many of you know, living on campus is more expensive.”</p>\n<p>She said she would be “more than happy” to privately discuss further details about her financial issues.</p>\n<p>Salari ran on a platform of reinforcing UCSB’s student health care system, citing early closing hours and the lack of an urgent care system.</p>\n<p>The A.S. Attorney General Zeina Safadi sent out an email to all senators to discuss Salari’s standing.</p>\n<p>Safadi said A.S. Elections Board initially approached Salari to ask about her living situation after they had received a complaint, to which she “did not provide a conclusive answer.”</p>\n<p>“There was no prior indication to Senate as a whole that Yasamin was in financial burden and thus Yasamin was not transparent about this situation; with that, there was an active effort to conceal,” Safadi said in the email.</p>\n<p>“Furthermore, the initial refusal to answer questions about her living situation solidifies the lack of transparency, and thus indicates her acknowledgement of violating the rule and the subsequent concealment of the violation.”</p>\n<p>Safadi added that “concealing the truth about not living among your representative constituents is a direct violation of [A.S.] Legal Code.”</p>\n<p>During Wednesday night’s Senate meeting, Senate voted to give Salari a one-time exception with the stipulation that her living situation would be later discussed within the A.S. Internal Committee.</p>\n<p>Several senators also discussed permanently changing legal codes to allow for future exceptions. There was no motion made regarding legal code changes.</p>\n<p><em>Correction [Nov. 16]: Salari did not specify the exact location of where she is living, only stating she is living off campus. That information was obtained from the email from A.G. and has been removed from this article at Salari’s request. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

id=\"caption-attachment-84938\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Wikicommons</p></div>\n<p>According to CalFresh Advocate Stephanie Perez, the Arbor is the first store on the UCSB campus at which students can use CalFresh.</p>\n<p>CalFresh, also known as the Federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (S.N.A.P.), gives eligible individuals electronically distributed monetary benefits every month which can be spent at specified local markets or grocery stores, according to the official website of the California Department of Social Services.</p>\n<p>The website also states that participants of the program are administered Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Cards which they can use to purchase food items at stores that accept CalFresh.</p>\n<p>“At UCSB, we estimate that about 10,000 students are eligible for CalFresh, and if you’re eligible, you may get up to $192 a month,” Melissa Fontaine, the food security coordinator at UCSB, said.</p>\n<p>During the 2016-17 academic school year, the UCSB CalFresh Team enrolled roughly 600 students in CalFresh, and 3,000 students in the following year, according to Fontaine.</p>\n<p>This year the CalFresh team hopes to enroll 6,000 students in the program by the end of Spring Quarter, Fontaine said.</p>\n<p>Fontaine said the new availability of CalFresh at the Arbor happened largely because the UCSB Sustainability Program saw student need for more affordable food options.</p>\n<p>UCSB CalFresh Advocate Stephanie Perez, a fourth-year psychology major, echoed this sentiment both as a representative of CalFresh and a participant in the program.</p>\n<p>“I actually grew up with food stamps, so I’m very familiar with the CalFresh program,” Perez said. “Without food stamps, I don’t think my family would’ve gotten through, especially since I come from a low-income household.”</p>\n<p>Now, as a UCSB student, Perez notes that CalFresh provides a new mobility and convenience to students that may not have been able to afford grabbing a quick snack in between classes at the Arbor.</p>\n<p>“Especially during midterms or maybe finals or maybe throughout the day, students sometimes don’t have time to go grocery shopping or don’t have time to go get a snack at home,” she said.</p>\n<p>Christian Ortiz Gonzalez, a fifth-year sociology and german studies major, was also heavily involved in bringing CalFresh to the school.</p>\n<p>“I decided to work on getting EBT accepted at UCSB because I saw a dire need for it,” Ortiz Gonzalez said in an email to the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Ortiz Gonzalez said he worked with several UCSB administrators and staff to help implement the program on campus.</p>\n<p>The new availability of CalFresh at the Arbor also follows a recent shift in the on-campus stigma surrounding the CalFresh program, which resulted from effective tabling and campaigning on the part of the CalFresh team, Perez said.</p>\n<p>“I think now, to be honest, UCSB has normalized what CalFresh is…I’ve heard a lot of people say, ‘Hey, how have do you not have CalFresh,’ like ‘You need to get on CalFresh.’”</p>\n<p>Fontaine stated she wanted to wait until the Arbor staff was fully trained on how to properly process CalFresh payments before making a public announcement about CalFresh’s availability.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important for the Arbor that their systems and staff are ready to go before students come to start spending their EBT CalFresh cards here at the Arbor because we want to make sure that everyone has a really great experience.”</p>\n<p>Now that CalFresh is available at the Arbor, Perez hopes the program will spread to other markets and food stores on campus.</p>\n<p>Fontaine said the spread of the program will “benefit both students and
