The trip is described on the Hillel </span><a href=\"https://santabarbarahillel.wufoo.com/forms/perspectives-with-sb-hillel-application-2020/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">application</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as an almost free “life-changing trip to explore Israel and the Palestinian Authority.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will bring UCSB undergraduate student leaders together to learn about inter-group and interpersonal relations. Along the way, we will explore Israeli society, Palestinian society, and the conflict in the region,” the application for the trip reads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the application page, the Santa Barbara Hillel, which is located in Isla Vista, says students will, among other things, “[hear] multiple narratives from a wide variety of speakers and guests, including religious, secular, Druze, Christian, Jewish-Israeli, Palestinian, and Muslim voices.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition lays out several reasons why Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) is opposed to the trip, building upon a statement it released </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/UCSBSJP/photos/a.531496596893112/2383080478401372/?type=3&amp;theater\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">last spring</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that called upon student leadership to “refrain from attending the Perspectives Israel Trip.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We oppose this trip on the basis of morally deficient funding sources, normalization of the occupation of Palestine, and its ultimate goal of silencing calls for Palestinian freedom,” the organization wrote in this year’s petition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SJP argues in the petition that any Associated Students (A.S.) senators who attended a Perspectives trip would have a conflict of interest if a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/a-s-senate-votes-against-divestment-through-secret-ballot/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“divestment resolution”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> were to be reintroduced this year. Over the past several years, A.S. senators have introduced various resolutions calling for A.S. and UCSB, among other UC entities, to withdraw investments from companies that profit off of alleged human rights violations by the Israeli government against the Palestinian people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last spring was the sixth time in seven years that a version of the resolution was introduced to the A.S. Senate. The resolution failed last year, making UCSB the only undergraduate campus in the UC system that has not passed a divestment resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Attorney General Tyler Barth, who is responsible for </span><a href=\"https://coc.as.ucsb.edu/position/office-of-the-attorney-general-attorney-general/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">investigating and prosecuting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “any potential violations of ASUCSB Legal Code,” said in an email that conflicts of interest are defined in A.S. Legal Code as “situations of personal financial gain (A1), situations wherein votes are cast to benefit friends and family (A2), and situations where the interests of AS senators’ outside organizational involvements conflict with the interests of ASUCSB (A3).”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said in a follow-up interview that while the Perspectives trips were mostly covered by the Santa Barbara Hillel, they did not count, in his interpretation of Legal Code, as a “financial gain,” since attendees did not actually receive any financial compensation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barth, in addition to a number of current and former elected members of A.S., went on the Perspectives trip this past summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I decided to go on this educational trip, I was seeking to enhance my knowledge of international issues through first-hand experience. If I thought it was a conflict of interest and would inhibit my ability to judge fairly and impartially as Attorney General the following year, I would not have gone,” Barth said in a message when asked if he believed his own attendance on the trip created a conflict of interest in determining if attending the trip created a conflict of interest for senators.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I maintain that, using the definition of conflict of interest in AS Legal Code that governs my position, Perspectives is not a conflict of interest for elected officials who have gone or intend to go on it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition also argues that the application for the trip “implicitly states” that the trip will be unbiased but does not actually provide students with “a diversity of perspectives” because the trip is funded by Maccabee Task Force (MTF); MTF advertises itself on its website as an organization created “to combat the disturbing spread of anti-Semitism on America’s college campuses.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe the BDS movement is at the forefront of this troubling trend. We maintain that BDS is an anti-Semitic movement that crosses the line from legitimate criticism of Israel into the dangerous demonization of Israel and its supporters,” MTF continues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement is “a Palestinian-led movement for freedom, justice and equality,” according to the </span><a href=\"https://bdsmovement.net/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">movement’s website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and “aims to end international support for Israeli violations of international law by forcing companies, institutions and governments to change their policies.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition argues that MTF’s stance “demonstrate[s] [MTF’s] closed mindedness regarding the occupation, given its obvious and vehement opposition to the Palestinian call for</span><a href=\"https://bdsmovement.net/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against Israel (BDS).” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SJP also condemns the fact that Sheldon Adelson — one of the </span><a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/trump-inc-podcast/sheldon-adelson-casino-magnate-trump-macau-and-japan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">biggest funders</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and a “</span><a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/2018/10/22/sheldon-adelson-breaks-spending-record-on-midterm-elections-surpassing-100m/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">conservative megadonor</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” — serves as president of MTF. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Furthermore, the reign of terror that Donald Trump and Republican Congresspeople have exacted on marginalized communities within the United States and across the globe, combined with the continued occupation of Palestine galvanized by far-right political figures in Israel, has been extensively funded by Adelson much like MTF’s Perspectives Trips,” the petition wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition also notes that the Santa Barbara Hillel received $238,739 from MTF in 2016 for “Campus Education and Trip to Israel” — the largest donation to a college campus listed on the </span><a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/474908810/201702979349300200/full\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maccabee Task Force’s 2016 tax returns</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — and an additional $119,807 in </span><a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/474908810/201842699349301204/full\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2017</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There was no donation purpose listed on the 2017 returns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This demonstrates the immense commitment from outside billionaires to engage in “pro-Israel” lobbying on students, specifically at the UCSB campus,” the petition wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goodman, the executive director of Santa Barbara Hillel, said the organization receives funding from people with a wide variety of political views, but that a funder’s political leanings do not affect the kind of programming the center puts on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It happens, that in this case, we have a funder who we’re transparent about. If students ask, we will tell them where the particular funding from portions of this comes from,” Goodman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our organization has a budget that is close to a million dollars; there’s no student who would be happy with the politics of every single one of those donors,” he added. “We have conservative students as well, who might not be happy with some of our progressive donors’ political leanings. But that doesn’t mean that we don’t use those funds to help put on Shabbat dinners on Friday night.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goodman also said he is personally responsible for putting together the itinerary for the Perspectives trip. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That doesn’t mean that my own personal politics need to align with a lead donor on this project to make it a successful project,” Goodman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Goodman said Hillel does not claim that the trip will be unbiased. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I make it very clear, it’s not unbiased. We’re gonna show them lots of biases, we’re gonna show them a wide variety of different perspectives, and they’re not gonna agree with all of them,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The idea that college students would come to college in order to advocate boycotts, and then advocate boycotts of things that could help you to learn more about the situation at hand or meet other people is patently absurd,” Goodman added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to opposing the trip due to its funding sources, SJP wrote in the petition that they are calling for a boycott of the trip because they believed the trip contributes to the “normalization of the occupation of Palestine, and its ultimate goal of silencing calls for Palestinian freedom.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SJP representatives Dylan Kupsh and Ivana Cruz said in an interview that they felt the need to circulate this petition because they believed “outside lobbyists” should not be influencing campus politics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope people understand the real gravity at stake at UCSB and how much people are lobbying,” Kupsh said. “I would be outraged as a student to know that an outside person is influencing student politics more than students themselves or student orgs.”  </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The program suspended seven study abroad programs in Europe earlier on March 12 and plans to officially suspend 30 more programs on March 16 as the U.S. Department of State and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued warnings against international travel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of March 16, programs in the Czech Republic, Costa Rica, Ghana, Jordan, Ireland, England and Scotland had also been suspended. On March 17 and 18, UCEAP announced its program in Chile and its programs in Brazil and Japan were also suspended. </span></p>\n<p>On March 19, UCEAP said all summer study abroad programs had been suspended as well.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC policy mandates that study abroad programs be suspended if there are Level 3 Travel Advisories, or “Avoid Nonessential Travel” for a country. As of Thursday, nine countries in Europe have now been given a </span><a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/coronavirus-europe#countries\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level 3

wrote on its website that all summer 2020 study abroad programs would continue as scheduled except:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biodiversity, National University of Singapore, Singapore</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">China summer 2020 programs</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span

Thailand</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel noted that the time difference made it difficult for her family, who often heard about news like Trump’s travel suspension while she was asleep. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They hear about everything before I do, and they’re freaking out for me, and I’m trying to calm them down from another continent,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For some students and their families, the stress of not knowing when — not if, when — the program would be canceled was too much to bear. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of my friends, her dad was freaking out and she’s going home tomorrow morning,” she said. “He called her yesterday and was like ‘I can’t handle this anymore, I don’t even know if your program’s gonna get cancelled but I’m buying you a ticket to come home.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that the programs have officially been canceled, UCEAP has been working with both the host universities abroad and the students’ home UC campuses to coordinate course credit, financial aid and all the other lingering questions that remain for these students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel said she was told by her study abroad advisor that UCEAP was attempting to convert the study abroad courses to online courses, so students could finish their semesters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But that sounds so impossible to me,” she said, while acknowledging that it would be her best option.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once she received the official cancelation email from UCEAP, Pimentel said she would probably book her flight home for late next week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t imagine having to crash courses if we can’t even be on campus until the end of April,” she said. “I don’t know how I would go about getting myself into classes. I also don’t know how I would handle housing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, Pimentel is focusing on enjoying her last few days abroad. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know, I just don’t want to come home. It’s two months early, and it’s really disappointing and really sad, but I just keep trying to remind myself that it could be worse,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><em>Updated: [3/19/20 3:45 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated: [3/17/20 3:02 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated: [3/16/20 11:30 a.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated: [3/14/20 2:12 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

With Jake Peavy at the front of our rotation and newly-minted hall-of-famer Trevor Hoffman at the back end, our dependable pitching always kept us in games. But despite all of their success, there was never a feeling we were truly competing for a title.</p>\n<p>In reality, we were lucky when we didn’t get swept in the first round of the playoffs – a yearly occurrence for a team that lacked any semblance of a threatening lineup.</p>\n<p>But when I got that notification on my phone in bold letters, “Hosmer decides to sign with Padres,” everything changed.</p>\n<p>San Diego has never, in my entire lifetime, signed an all-star in the midst of his prime – that is, until now. Hosmer is only 28 and is coming off a career season in which he hit .318 with 25 homers at the plate.</p>\n<p>Two seasons ago, this man was named the All-Star Game MVP at Petco Park, proving that perhaps he can overcome the mental mistakes of hitters in the past and actually have success hitting at Petco. As a lefty, those odds are even more likely.</p>\n<p>The city needed this. It was about a year ago that Dean Spanos screwed over an entire city of loyal fans by moving the Chargers.</p>\n<p>San Diego State Basketball hasn’t been up to par since Steve Fisher retired – even before that, if we’re being honest.</p>\n<p>We need a team to get behind, to energize the fan base, to get “America’s Finest City” excited about something again.</p>\n<p>I’m not quixotic enough to really believe that signing Hosmer will automatically catapult us into the title conversation; in fact, I’m not even sure it makes us a playoff team this year. Putting Hosmer at first pushes Wil Myers to the outfield, a position that he once said he “gets bored playing.” Myers gladly signed on to the move, but by no means is he a Gold Glover out there.<br>\nIn addition, our rotation is still a mess, to put it mildly.</p>\n<p>Half of our rotation is probably closer to being in a retirement home than an adequate major league starter. I mean, Chris Young was a good starter for the Padres … in 2006. If Kemp was the old iPhone model, then Young is an iPod Touch Generation Two. With that being said, it supports my notion that the Padres lack an ideal major league rotation.</p>\n<p>Pundits have been all too kind in pointing this out, questioning the fit and the Padres decision to dole out over $140 million to a player who has been inconsistent at times throughout his career.</p>\n<p>But Hosmer has two things that his stats can’t account for: leadership and experience.</p>\n<p>He’s been to the World Series with the Royals. According to Ken Rosenthal, reviews have been “glowing” on Hosmer’s clubhouse presence. He can provide invaluable insight for a young rebuilding roster that boasts one of the best farm systems in the majors.</p>\n<p>And because of his age, he still fits in the Padres’ long-term plans. The goal the entire time was to “compete” in 2019; at that point, Hosmer will still only be 29.</p>\n<p>Plus, the deal is front-loaded to allow the Padres to get rid of him after five years with a much lesser salary hit.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, we have a reason to celebrate, to see the clear vision of the front office and to applaud them for finally being willing to spend money. We have a reason to cheer again.</p>\n<p>Just like every year in the recent past, I’ll be attending opening day with my dad. This time, however, I will do so with renewed hope. This time, I will do so with the belief that we are on the cusp of finally bringing a title back to the city I hold so dear.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Feb. 22</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.
