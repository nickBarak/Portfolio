With the Bruins capturing the early lead 1-0, the meet continued on to singles play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning singles play were two extremely talented players who have been crucial to their respective teams all season, UCLA’s No. 5 Shibahara and UCSB’s Dubavets. The two standouts battled heavily throughout the match, keeping a close score with every set. </span></p>\n<p>However, it was Shibahara who was able to keep Dubavets away and earned the victory in two sets 6-3, 6-4. Up next was Stojic’s turn to try to turn it around for the Gauchos in her match against Miller. Stojic was able to win the first set 6-3, but Miller was able to complete the comeback as she went on to win the next two sets 6-3, 6-2.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Da Silveira continued the Gauchos’ fighting spirit and played an extremely tough first set against her opponent, junior Terri Fleming. Fleming was able to win the first set 7-6 and Da Silveira was unable to come back as she lost the second set 6-2. Like the previous battle between UCLA and UCSB, the meet finished in a 4-0 Bruin victory with three singles matches left unfinished. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos’ loss does not come from a lack of effort or will to win. The team was simply unable to come out on top after pushing the matches to the brink. The loss of several close matches came one after another, and UCLA was successfully able to prevent the Gauchos from establishing a rhythm and attempting a comeback. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key Gauchos on the team such as Dubavets, Stojic and Atanasson were unable to step up and, despite the valiant effort, do have to feel disappointed with exiting the tournament so early. </span></p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s tennis team’s season ends with an overall record of 17-10; a perfect April and 10-game winning streak helped the team finish with the second seed in the Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos went on to win the Big West Championship, their second consecutive title and reached the first round of the NCAA tournament. The end of the Gauchos’ season brings the graduation of seniors Baker, Jaimee Gilbertson oxford, and Stojic. However, the Gauchos will be able to retain Dubavets, Atanasson, and Da Silveira for one more year.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77864\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/womens-tennis-puts-up-valiant-effort-in-4-0-loss-to-ucla-in-first-round-of-ncaa-regional/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77864\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/womens-tennis-puts-up-valiant-effort-in-4-0-loss-to-ucla-in-first-round-of-ncaa-regional/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/womens-tennis-puts-up-valiant-effort-in-4-0-loss-to-ucla-in-first-round-of-ncaa-regional/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/womens-tennis-puts-up-valiant-effort-in-4-0-loss-to-ucla-in-first-round-of-ncaa-regional/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/womens-tennis-puts-up-valiant-effort-in-4-0-loss-to-ucla-in-first-round-of-ncaa-regional/","id":1204,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1203,1202,1201],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez","biography":"Not available","articles":[45,52,64,67,68,69,71,1111,1132,1136,1160,1162,1165,1169,1170,1172,1197,1201,1202,1204,1205,1377,1380,1383,1388,1399,1497,1921,3342,4097,4106,4111,4266,4268,4270,4273,4274,4282,4287,4819,4822,4828,4889,4891,4892,4893],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Returning the Favor: The Reintroduction of UCSB Women’s Tennis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-10.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-10.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After winning its first NCAA Tournament match in program history last season, the UCSB women's tennis team entered its 2016-17 campaign even more determined to continue the ascension of the Gauchos re...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>At the end of March, the UCSB women’s tennis team had an overall record of 7-9.

It’s exciting to get back to NCAA play.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos needed to get back to the Big West Championship, and that is exactly what the team did.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77704\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-22_stephenmanga_wtennis-2-web/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77704\" data-attachment-id=\"77704\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/returning-the-favor-the-reintroduction-of-ucsb-womens-tennis/2017-04-22_stephenmanga_wtennis-2-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-77704\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web-1024x683.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77704\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jaimee Gilbertson returns a serve with a powerful backhand.<em> Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The squad beat rival Cal Poly 4-0 in the quarterfinals and then went on to beat perennial opponent Long Beach State 4-1, all to find themselves at the stage at which the team believed they were going to end up all season long.</p>\n<p>The only team in the way of the Gauchos moving on to the NCAA tournament was, you guessed it, the University of Hawaii. The Gauchos played an exciting match, with the clinching point coming from a singles victory by freshman Stephanie Yamada.</p>\n<p>The final victory in the month of April allowed the Gauchos to yet again raise the cup, a satisfaction surely made sweeter by beating the team that had been above them so often during the season. The Championship win also meant a perfect April for the UCSB women’s tennis team, as the team won all 10 games played, and they will surely carry that momentum into the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s tennis program has not always experienced this kind of success. Last year’s Big West Championship became the program’s first in 20 years. The team had fallen into mediocrity after winning the Big West Championship six consecutive years from 1991-1996.</p>\n<p>The work toward obtaining the accolades UCSB has earned over the past couple of seasons can be traced back to five years ago, when longtime Fresno State Head Coach Simon Thibodeau was brought to Santa Barbara to lead the program.</p>\n<p>“Well, it was difficult to leave Fresno State, where we had a lot of success, and I was really trying to bring UCSB to the same level. I felt the school had even more potential due to the location and academic rank of this school,” Thibodeau said.</p>\n<p>For the first three seasons of Thibodeau’s career, the team went 39-34, during which it was bounced out of the tournament every single season; the conference final was its highest mark yet.</p>\n<p>However, it was in this period of time when Thibodeau began to recruit players who would grow to be important pieces of the current winning formula at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Melissa Baker and Jaimee Gilbertson were added in 2013 and Natalie Da Silveira became a Gaucho in 2014. The 2015 additions to the squad included Amanda Atanasson, Palina Dubavets, Stefani Stojic and Yamada.</p>\n<p>“We also had a donor who boosted our scholarship amount, so we were able to go get a few more players like Palina, Amanda and Stefani Stojic, who are all transfers, and we gained some budget in their scholarship, so I was able to get more top players and I was able to compete at the highest level.”</p>\n<p>All of these players have been critical to UCSB’s rise to the top of the Big West Conference, and Thibodeau credits an increase in funding from UCSB donors as the primary reason the women’s tennis program is able to acquire highly talented transfers such as Dubavets and Stojic.</p>\n<p>“We really try to make this program the full package for any prospect in the world that wants to go study in the U.S. and play tennis. We’re getting closer; we would like to build more facilities in the future, but that’s the next step in terms of fundraising.”</p>\n<p>The current tennis roster boasts seven international players out of the current 12 roster spots, a sign of the increased ability of the program to attract better prospects.</p>\n<p>“Most of the best teams in the tournament are all fully funded in their scholarships. They have the NCAA limitation of eight full in/out of state scholarships for their players. That was not the case here when I took the program, and we really needed to fundraise to get to the amount that most of the big programs have.”</p>\n<p>Headed into the NCAA tournament, the Gauchos are looking to see how they will measure up to this top-25 talent showcased throughout the NCAA tournament and are hoping that the increased experience coming off of last year’s tournament exit will propel them farther than the second round.</p>\n<p>“We feel that we are just one player away from being able to compete with the top 16 teams in the country, and we hope to be at that level in the years to come.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 11, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77781\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/returning-the-favor-the-reintroduction-of-ucsb-womens-tennis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77781\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/returning-the-favor-the-reintroduction-of-ucsb-womens-tennis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/returning-the-favor-the-reintroduction-of-ucsb-womens-tennis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/returning-the-favor-the-reintroduction-of-ucsb-womens-tennis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/returning-the-favor-the-reintroduction-of-ucsb-womens-tennis/","id":1201,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1200,1199,1198],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Rallying Gauchos Prepare for Bruins to Open Postseason","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-6-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Able to end its 20-year drought of not winning a Big West title, the UCSB women's tennis program awaits to face UCLA in its second consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance.

I’ve felt that this is a match we would want to see again, so it’s exciting to get a replay with them at a neutral site,” Head Coach Simon Thibodeau said.</p>\n<p>This second look for the Gauchos at the talented UCLA squad seems to be as challenging as the time before, as UCSB will have to deal with the overall talent of the Bruin roster, which is comprised of standouts like Shibahara and Hart.</p>\n<p>Shibahara is currently ranked the No. 5 singles player in the nation, and the pair of Shibara and Hart is currently ranked No. 12 in the nation. Hart is also ranked in another Bruin doubles pair alongside junior Terri Fleming at No. 32.</p>\n<p>The Bruins third and final ranked pair headed into the matchup this weekend is No. 58 sophomores Gabby Andrews and Alaina Miller. The three ranked doubles teams and talented singles players on the Bruins roster are all challenges looking to prevent the Gauchos from progressing onto the second round of the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>If there was a time for Santa Barbara to come out with a hard-fought win against a tough team, it would be now.</p>\n<p>The team has not lost a match since its regular-season battle with Hawaii on March 30 and is now carrying the momentum of a perfect month of April, which saw the team win 10 consecutive matches and earn a second consecutive Big West Championship.</p>\n<p>The keys Gauchos behind this season’s impressive playoff push, such as juniors Palina Dubavets and Natalie Da Silveira and seniors Stefani Stojic, Melissa Baker and Jaimee Gilbertson, have all earned a variety of accolades for their efforts respectively.</p>\n<p>The Big West named Dubavets to the singles first team, and she also earned a spot on both the doubles first and second team rosters.</p>\n<p>Da Silveira and Gilbertson earned second team singles honors. Stojic was named to the doubles first team for her work as one half of the Dubavets/Stojic pair, and Baker was named to the doubles second team for her partnership with Dubavets as well. It is these players who the Gauchos are hoping will push the team to new heights in the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>“We have seven of the eight players returning from last year’s team, and everyone has seemed to gain experience and play better,” Thibodeau said. “We have a similar team, but with more experience, and now we’re playing a team that we know at a site closer to home, which has us feeling good about the match.”</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s tennis team will play the No. 23 UCLA Bruins on Friday, May 12, at 10 a.m. If UCSB advances, it will face either Pepperdine or LIU Brooklyn on Saturday, May 13 at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 4, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77783\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/rallying-gauchos-prepare-for-bruins-to-open-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77783\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/rallying-gauchos-prepare-for-bruins-to-open-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/rallying-gauchos-prepare-for-bruins-to-open-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/rallying-gauchos-prepare-for-bruins-to-open-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/rallying-gauchos-prepare-for-bruins-to-open-postseason/","id":1202,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1201,1200,1199],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos-Rebels Showdown Set for First Round of NCAA Championships","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_MTennis-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_MTennis-10-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Able to three-peat as Big West champions, the Gauchos are looking to make the next step to go deeper in the postseason beginning this Friday against Ole Miss.

The Gauchos are coming off an exciting Big West Championship run which was sweetly capped off with a 4-1 victory over their Blue-Green rival, the Cal Poly Mustangs.</p>\n<p>This competition had impressive performances across all team members, which ultimately elevated UCSB’s standings in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association rankings. Previously at the No. 40 spot, the Gauchos now boast No. 37 overall.</p>\n<p>As for Santa Barbara’s star Court 1 doubles pair of junior Simon Freund and senior Morgan Mays, they also remain in the top 40 in the nation at No. 35 overall.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Ole Miss’s regular-season finish led to it earning sixth place in the SEC tennis standings.</p>\n<p>The Rebels are coming off their most recent match against the University of Florida, in which they were swept 4-0 in the quarterfinal round and subsequently knocked out of the SEC championship tournament.</p>\n<p>This result hardly deteriorated their ITA score, as their ranking actually moved up a spot, from No. 28 to No. 27. The Rebels also hold both singles and doubles honors, as junior All-American Gustav Hansson is ranked 23rd in the nation while sophomore Fabian Fallert and junior Grey Hamilton hold the 19th overall spot.</p>\n<p>Before being swept 4-0, Ole Miss was on an eight-match win streak with its last loss occurring back in early April.</p>\n<p>Adding incentive to the match will be the No. 4 singles match, as both Ole Miss’s sophomore Fabian Fallert and UCSB’s sophomore Anders Holm will look to end each other’s 11-match win streaks.</p>\n<p>Friday will be the first time UCSB has ever faced Ole Miss. The recurring strategy and point of emphasis has been the Gauchos’ doubles play. It has been key in their double-digit win streak and has aided the team’s ability to stand its ground against top-20 programs.</p>\n<p>“The doubles point is always so huge,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “It’s only one point but it’s the first point of the match, and emotionally it gave us a real lift … singles as a result has shown this.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos went undefeated in the entire month of April and will look to start May off on the right foot as well. The winner of this first-round matchup will then go on and face either No. 5 UCLA or Army West Point.</p>\n<p>UCSB is set to play Ole Miss on Friday, May 12, at 10 a.m. at UCLA’s Sunset Canyon Tennis Courts.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 11, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77780\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/gauchos-rebels-showdown-set-for-first-round-of-ncaa-championships/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77780\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/gauchos-rebels-showdown-set-for-first-round-of-ncaa-championships/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/gauchos-rebels-showdown-set-for-first-round-of-ncaa-championships/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/gauchos-rebels-showdown-set-for-first-round-of-ncaa-championships/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/gauchos-rebels-showdown-set-for-first-round-of-ncaa-championships/","id":1203,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1202,1201,1200],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
