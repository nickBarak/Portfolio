The estimated cost for the total required units needed for the certificate is $1,800.</p>\n<p>Each unit of a course offered through the UCSB Extension for this program costs $275, according to the certificate program’s website.</p>\n<p>Some of the new courses offered through Extension include “Data-Driven Journalism” and “Visual Journalism,” which aim to incorporate the “cutting-edge” changes in the journalism industry into the certificate program at UCSB, Sorapure said.</p>\n<p>The “International Reporting” course at Extension gives students an opportunity to gain “hands-on experience” in international reporting through a three-phase international reporting trip, according to the program’s website.</p>\n<p>The course will take place in Spring Quarter 2019 and carry on into the summer. It will begin with a research and story preparation phase, followed by a two-week foreign reporting trip before finishing in Santa Barbara with a presentation ceremony of the coursework to friends and family.</p>\n<p>It will count toward four units for the Extension requirement. Next year’s trip is planned to take place in Berlin, Germany during Summer 2019, according to Morris.</p>\n<p>Madeleine Sorapure, director of UCSB’s writing program, and Bob York, interim dean at UCSB Extension, began planning for the program during Fall Quarter 2017.</p>\n<p>The two began by discussing a possible collaboration between the writing program and UCSB Extension. The potential for a journalism program came up as a natural fit during these discussions, Sorapure said.</p>\n<p>“It just seemed like sort of a natural certificate program because of the professional aspect of it … There’s something about it that’s very kind of one foot in UCSB, one foot in the world,” Sorapure said.</p>\n<p>Morris said she has noticed a desire among students for opportunities to further an interest in journalism.</p>\n<p>“There are opportunities in the campus to work on campus journalism, but there are only a few journalism courses that are offered in the writing program … Part of what we’re doing is trying to address that,” Morris said.</p>\n<p>The courses offered in the program can benefit students interested in all types of careers in a professional field, according to Morris.</p>\n<p>“It’s so important right now to train people in how to write for media. Even if you don’t end up a professional journalist, these courses that we’re offering, they’re really fundamental to modern communications in the professional world, whatever you go into,” Morris said.</p>\n<p>Students can begin registering for the first class available for the certificate program, Writing 24, during their pastimes on G.O.L.D.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the May 24, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

One of the backpacks represented a UCSB student who recently passed away.</p>\n<p>Richard Martinez — the father of Christopher Michaels-Martinez — has been a vocal advocate for gun control since the death of his son.</p>\n<p>“From the day Chris was killed I’ve been speaking out against gun violence. I was so angry and so frustrated with the way things were and the pointlessness of having to lose a child in this way,” Martinez said.</p>\n<p>“I’m completely devoted to trying to make this change. It’s the only thing that’s important to me,” he added.</p>\n<p>While Martinez and others spoke to the crowd, participants gathered and held a blue string that connected everyone present.</p>\n<p>Organizers handed out artificial candles for participants to hold during the memorial. Blunite, an organization created following the shooting, initially began the tradition of handing out blue L.E.D. lights during the 2015 memorial for the shooting.</p>\n<p>Artificial blue candles similar to the ones used during this memorial have also been used by students during several other memorials that have been held on campus.</p>\n<p>Briana Michael, one of the leaders of Blunite, also spoke at the memorial. Michael curated the memorial and worked with other collaborators to plan the event.</p>\n<p>Michael, who was a first-year student at UCSB when the 2014 shooting occurred, spoke about how she had been personally affected by gun violence.</p>\n<p>“We as educated youth need to push to do more. Way more than saying something on Facebook or tweet something. There needs to be more,” Michael said.</p>\n<p>Campus and community events on both Monday and Tuesday focused on spreading awareness about the tragedy in I.V. and taking action for gun control. The event series was titled “#Enough.”</p>\n<p>On Monday, organizers tabled and set up an interactive art piece in the Arbor. On Tuesday, organizers led “Coffee and Calls” to urge legislators to show support for gun control.</p>\n<p>At the memorial’s end, Michael asked participants to place their candles near a backpack and say the name of the school written on the tag.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <em>Nexus</em> after the memorial, Martinez encouraged people to walk away from the memorial knowing they could take action against gun violence.</p>\n<p>“Vote, volunteer, contribute,” Martinez said. “Don’t let it stand the way it is. It doesn’t have to be like this.”</p>\n<p><em>Katie Wolf contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.5 of the May 24 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

program was created in hopes of fostering higher retention rates for transfer students beyond their first year at UCSB.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UC Santa Barbara’s Educational Opportunity Program launched the Summer Transfer Transition Program, a project designed to smoothen the transition for transfer students starting at UCSB, for the first time this summer.</p>\n<p>The three-day “bridge” program – focused on helping transfer students with the transition to a new college – was offered to Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) students during the last week in August.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the three days, students learned about several campus resources, such as the Office of Financial Aid, as well as leadership opportunities and the different major departments around campus.</p>\n<p>The program was created in hopes of fostering higher retention rates for transfer students beyond their first year at UCSB, according to Angelica Caudillo, a Counselor for Student Transfer Services, and Brenda Curiel, EOP’s Assistant Director.</p>\n<p>“Transfer students face a multitude of challenges once they transfer to a 4 year institution,” Caudillo and Curiel said in a joint email.</p>\n<p>“[Challenges include] adjusting to the campus, transitioning from semester to quarter system, financial aid support, obtaining a sense of community [and] getting connected with campus resources.”</p>\n<p>In 2016, the first year transfer retention rate was 92.7 percent, according to <a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/ug-outcomes\">UC Undergraduate Graduation Rates</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe style=\"width: 830px; min-height: 530px;

of the Univerity of California Office of the President. <em>Hayley Tice / Daily Nexus</em></h6>\n<p>The percentage of transfer students who were accepted into UCSB has increased in recent years, jumping from 51.6 percent for the 2016- 2017 school year to 55.7 percent for the 2017-2018 school year, according to <a href=\"http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/campus.profiles/campus.profiles.2017.18.pdf\">UCSB’s Campus Profile.</a></p>\n<p>The creation of Summer Transfer Tradition Program (STTP) was in part a response to this growing demographic.</p>\n<p>“The goal of the EOP Summer Transfer Transition Program is to retain transfer students… and build a sense of community, and support their academic and overall success at UCSB,” Caudillo and Curiel said.</p>\n<p>Several on-campus departments, including the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, Tropicana Housing and the College of Letters and Science, aided EOP in the development of the program.</p>\n<p>“EOP focused in a holistic approach for the entirety of the summer program,” Caudillo and Curiel said.</p>\n<p>According to the EOP Website, the EOP office <a href=\"http://eop.sa.ucsb.edu/about-us\">strives</a> to immerse “income eligible and first-generation undergraduates” within campus life to help them thrive both academically and socially, and as a result, to prepare them to find jobs in their respective fields following graduation.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button
