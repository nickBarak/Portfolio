Main space as a “safe space for the workers to decompress” for the duration of the strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s important to have the institutional support behind the workers who are really just asking for fair wages and stable benefits,” Solomon said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also asks the Senate to formally endorse the strike and requests the Office of the Student Advocate (OSA) have a representative at the strike to offer OSA resources and services for the workers on strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student Advocate General (S.A.G.) Grecia Martinez will also be purchasing $600 worth of food and beverages for the workers through the Senate’s unallocated funds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Senate decided to double the original amount requested ($300) after learning that the strike is expecting approximately 500 students per day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution also calls upon A.S. President Brooke Kopel and Chancellor Henry T. Yang to write a letter in support of the strike to Janet Napolitano, UCOP (UC Office of the President), the UC Board of Regents and UC Labor Relations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I will readily write the letter and consult the authors of the resolution and students that worked on it for input on the letter,” Kopel said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second resolution, authored by Palmerin and Briseno, calls for an A.S. “work stoppage” in support of the strike. It promises to compensate the A.S. student workers who sign in at the strike and miss their shifts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A.S. entities that will be affected by the work stoppage include the A.S Bike Shop, A.S. Recycling, A.S. Department of Public Worms, A.S. Zero Waste Committee, A.S. Publications and the A.S Main building, according to the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facilities including the A.S. Food Bank and the A.S. Legal Resource Center will not be closed due to the nature of the services they provide for students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution also requires no police presence in A.S. Main for the duration of the strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third resolution, authored by Cornejo and Uribe, encourages student workers to strike in solidarity and “endorses the usage of any and all AS resources in providing aid” to students who do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building upon the resolution presented by Solomon and Toubian, this resolution also requires OSA to offer several services including “information relating to University rights, protocols, and procedures, information on strikes and protests rights and procedures, information on appeals processes, and referrals to local legal representation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) plans to strike from Oct. 23 to Oct. 25 to protest a “year and a half of deadlocked negotiations [and] concerns about growing racial and gender disparities within UC’s workforce,” according to a press release from AFSCME spokesperson John de los Angeles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Numerous undergraduate and graduate students spoke at public forum, calling for the A.S. Senate to pass the resolutions and personally show their support by showing up at the picket line. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s time for you to support us, so that we can support you,” Juan Donato, lead groundskeeper and Member Action Team for AFSCME, said.</span></p>\n<p><em>Katherine Swartz contributed reporting. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

It also focuses these resources toward students from low-income communities, with the hope of giving them a higher chance of attending college and becoming productive members of the workforce.</p>\n<p>“We have some serious issues on the planet that must be solved soon, and students with a good education can be positioned to be part of that solution,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p>Ortiz, who graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 1985, originally got involved with the organization as an undergraduate.</p>\n<p>He worked as a tutor for the program during his college years and went on to take a temporary job doing outreach following his graduation.</p>\n<p>After continuing his education at Cal State Northridge and the University of La Verne, he eventually returned to UCSB in 2000 to become EAOP Director.</p>\n<p>“We need more students to participate in higher ed. Our economy needs a highly educated workforce and we are helping that process,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p>When the EAOP was first created, its intent was to diversify the student body of UC campuses by providing resources to racial minorities.</p>\n<p>Over the years, its focus has shifted to targeting low-income, first-generation students who do not have readily available access to college services. The program now spans three counties and soon will be serving 11 high schools.</p>\n<p>“The idea was to increase college enrollment rates from these schools that were usually associated with low-income communities that don’t always have the same resources to prepare for college,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p>With over 2,000 students enrolled in its cohort, the program’s services reach a wide range of students, including those at the middle and elementary school levels.</p>\n<p>EAOP’s welcoming atmosphere is evident through its dedicated staff. Mirka Lopez, a first-generation student herself, works as college-site coordinator for the program.</p>\n<p>“[The EAOP] gives them that motivation and encouragement because sometimes they don’t think they belong at a UC, or they’ve never set foot on a college campus,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>“Through this program they get the opportunity to explore their options and learn what kind of resources there are.”</p>\n<p>The program also has several student interns on staff, allowing UCSB students to serve as role models for under-represented teenagers.</p>\n<p>For Daniel Segura, a second-year sociology major and EAOP intern, the program is especially meaningful.</p>\n<p>“It means a lot to me because I was a part of EAOP myself in high school, so my first experiences with college were through the program,” Segura said.</p>\n<p>“Now that we’re interns, we get to see those effects on other kids, seeing them believe that college is actually possible because someone like them actually made it.”</p>\n<p>However, EAOP has endured its share of struggles over the years, including several budget and staff cuts.</p>\n<p>Staff went from 23 to nine in the mid-2000s, and EAOP suffered additional monetary cuts due to the fluctuating economy, according to Ortiz.</p>\n<p>EAOP began a using new budget model in 2007 that shares costs with its school sites to help run the program.

Senate on Wednesday, highlighting the specific changes and non-changes to the policy.</p>\n<p>The UC-wide sexual violence and sexual harassment policy is currently in a formal review period.</p>\n<p>The policy previously stated that all graduate students were mandatory reporters of any sexual harassment or violence. Now, graduate students are only mandatory reporters when “we’re in our capacity as an employee,” Selvidge said.</p>\n<p>“We are not particularly well trained in this,” she said. “We have sort of a one-hour… online training that covers explanations of all of sexual violence, all of sexual harassment, stalking, dating and domestic violence … It’s really not enough to have us understand how to respond sensitively.”</p>\n<p>Selvidge emphasized that all other student employees who are paid by the university remain “responsible employees,” meaning they are required to report to the Title IX office in the event that they become aware of sexual violence or harassment committed against another student while they are acting as employees.</p>\n<p>Selvidge also discussed changes to the definition of consent. The committee now defines consent as “unable to understand the…nature of sexual activity due to…alcohol and drugs.”</p>\n<p>The policy’s change says the student would need to be incapacitated for consent to be questioned, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the formal investigation time period has been increased from sixty calendar days to ninety business days.</p>\n<p>She explained the change stemmed from the university, stating they have struggled with finding enough time to complete investigations within the sixty 60 calendar day time restraint limit in the past.</p>\n<p>The student’s decision of whether or not they want a formal investigation is now not a determining factor of whether they actually get a formal investigation, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>“The university will investigate things without people’s consent,” Selvidge said.</p>\n<p>Another aspect of the Title IX policy that Selvidge outlined in her presentation was in regards to the sexual assault of minors.</p>\n<p>UCSB does not consider statutory rape to be sexual assault, according to Selvidge. She pointed out that the university is trying to keep in mind 17-year-olds and their dating life.</p>\n<p>However, several graduate students at the GSA meeting expressed their concern for their own children living on campus. It worried them that the university does not see the possible rape of their children as sexual assault, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>Selvidge also discussed the new revision to the definition of sexual assault penetration and contact, which now includes language that is more inclusive toward the LGBTQ+ community, as well as male victims.</p>\n<p>“I am actually very happy with this particular change. This is something that I worked on convincing them for several years,” Selvidge said.</p>\n<p>Power imbalances, such as the dynamic between a teacher assistant and a student, are now taken into consideration as aggravating circumstances in the new policy, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>Relationship violence has also been expanded to include non-physical conduct such as the abuse of a pet or the destruction of property.</p>\n<p>The Title IX Student Advisory Board consists of one undergraduate and one graduate student from each UC campus, making a total of 19 board members.</p>\n<p>Currently, the undergraduate position for UCSB is vacant. Students who are interested should contact Ariana Alvarez, the Title IX Officer for UCSB.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84299\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84299\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/","id":2211,"author":{"id":64,"name":"Aaron Berkness"},"related":[2210,2209,2208],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Speace of Mind: 2010’s NFL QB Shuffle","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"So I’m now deeply invested in this ABC Family friendly show called Friday Night Lights.

Unlike any other position  on the team, the quarterback has the most to gain — but also the most to lose. Throughout the history of modern football there has always been quarterback drama. Tom Brady upending Drew Bledsoe, Kurt Warner taking the position from Trent Green, and Doug “Flutie Flakes” Flutie snatching the job from the grossly overpaid Rob Johnson. It is where even the lowest-drafted nobody can upend the first-round picked somebody and become a legend for little boys across America to look up to.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The second and third-string QBs can look chummy and cheery, with their baseball caps clipboards, but you better believe that QB #1 is holding on for dear life to avoid being the next Drew Bledsoe. Because believe me, the way this season is going, there is a strong possibility that the above may happen.</p>\n<p>This 2010 NFL season has been riddled with quarterback controversies. Everyday there is some sort of “breaking news” of QB #2’s outright overtaking of QB #1, QB #1’s injuries (or suspensions) that thrust QB #2 into the spotlight, or, in rare cases, QB #3 or #4 leapfrogging the entire group to grab the reins of the team. Take a look at the starting QBs for Week Three. The names on that list are more foreign to me than Little Ethiopia in West Hollywood. A word to the wise: stay far away from the kitfo. Just do it.</p>\n<p>Honestly though, when did Chad Pennington of the Dolphins turn into Chad Henne?  When did the golden boy, Matthew Stafford, go down with a bad enough of an injury that Shaun Hill had to replace him? Buffalo recently became more irrelevant by dumping Trent Edwards and turning to Ryan Fitzpatrick.</p>\n<p>With all that being said, I am all for upsets. I love the story of the underdog coming from behind to steal the thunder of someone who became too comfortable. Charlie Batch had a very solid outing on Sunday, with three touchdowns and over 200 yards thrown. Fitzpatrick came extremely close to Bundchen’s overall passer rating, with two touchdowns thrown in Buffalo’s closer-than-expected loss to the Pats. Heck, my buddy Shaun Hill had a higher passer rating than Brett Favre.</p>\n<p>Maybe we have come upon a new era in the NFL. Maybe the reins won’t be so blindly handed to the hyped “star QB #1” anymore, but instead be put up for grabs. I am sure that the Peyton Mannings of the world will be the odds on favorites to keep their positions for years to come, and that is justified.</p>\n<p>Maybe for these other teams, such as the Jaguars or the Bills, where the starting QB isn’t so set in stone, there will be that tiny glimpse for an unknown to become a well known. Perhaps it’s just me, but this Joe Schmo decade that we may be embarking on soon isn’t looking too bad.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus sports columnist Julia Speace likes Tom Brady’s Hair. A lot.
