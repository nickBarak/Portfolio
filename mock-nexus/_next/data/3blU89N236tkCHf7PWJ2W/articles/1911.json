What should be taken into full account when evaluating and labeling a point guard with what has become such an unpredictable status? Is it assists? Points? Plus/minus value? Postseason success/experience?</p>\n<p>No clear-cut answer prevails, and there’s no guarantee as to whether or not there will ever be one. Yet, the time is now to acknowledge and appreciate the mounting progression of the point guard earning more stardom in the NBA.</p>\n<p>The traditional approach of being a pass-first, low-scoring point no longer defines the coveted floor general. Although the fundamentals of being able to run and orchestrate the offense from the top of the key are still staples, the “one” has transformed into a more versatile entity within itself.</p>\n<p>While various elements, including the type of offensive/defensive systems implemented, player roles, scouting, coaching and executive responsibilities, each have an influence on player performance, point guards are reaching a new pinnacle of significance.</p>\n<p>NBA history has been rewritten following the milestones of point guards over the years.</p>\n<p>From Derrick Rose becoming the youngest NBA MVP ever to Steph Curry becoming the first ever unanimous NBA MVP in his second-straight winning of the award to Russell Westbrook breaking Oscar Robertson’s record by setting the new single-season triple-double record at 42, the NBA’s longtime “Where Amazing Happens” campaign seems to be most fittingly applied to today’s arsenal of point guards.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to the 2017 NBA Draft — set to take place on June 22, 2017 — the point guard position is set to be the most coveted cohort of players on the board in the early portion of the first round.</p>\n<p>It is possible that five point guards — Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, De’Aaron Fox, Dennis Smith Jr. and Frank Ntilikina — could be selected in the lottery, which would be the most since 1999.</p>\n<p>While the upcoming class of point guards will anticipate adding their own style to the game, the diverse makeup of today’s offensive leaders include a nostalgic nature as well.</p>\n<p>Reminiscent with the likes of legends Earvin “Magic” Johnson and Oscar Robertson, the notion of the “point forward” is even more relevant in the NBA today with the emergence of the aforementioned Antetokounmpo and James or the 76ers’ decision that Ben Simmons will run the point in his debut next season.</p>\n<p>Likely to be judged as oversized or too uncoordinated for the point position if viewed by the standards of the ABA or NBA’s early years, the developing trend of bigger, stronger and massively built players has changed the prototypical state of the point guard for the better.</p>\n<p>Just look at the hype and frenzy we all went into when then prospect 7-footer Thon Maker’s basketball highlight tape went viral on social media, with him coming up the court and performing AND-1 like, ankle-breaking crossovers while pulling up for shots from just about anywhere on the court.</p>\n<p>Surely there’s no way anyone could discredit the heart and talent of current playmakers like Chris Paul or Isaiah Thomas, who are on the shorter side of the height spectrum, but the existence of the “Space Jam” Monstars build (for lack of a better word) of players transitioning into point guards is fascinating and fun to watch.</p>\n<p>Despite the contrast in build and body frame, this same transition applies with players like James Harden, who was named the Houston Rockets’ point guard after the hiring of Mike D’Antoni and has exceled since then. He finished the 2016-17 NBA regular season with career highs in points per game, assists (11.2) and rebounds (8.1), leaving many in favor of him winning the NBA MVP award.</p>\n<p>With an ability to create his own shot and drain it from either short or long-range distances and drive and kill defenders off with his signature Euro-step or draw fouls, Harden’s skillset has been enhanced most by his improved vision on the court when scoring or finding open teammates.</p>\n<p>But the dynamic of the point guard doesn’t end with size, athleticism, scoring or passing ability; it also includes the slashing and aggressive nature of players such as potential NBA MVP Russell Westbrook and John Wall.</p>\n<p>Although everyone is entitled to and possesses their own liking for each style, the NBA point guard has become somewhat atypical due to the fact that it’s a position constantly redefining itself.</p>\n<p>With the NBA playoffs in full effect, all of the league’s top point guards are performing on the game’s biggest stage. It is time for us all to delay the “elite” discussion and appreciate what’s available at the moment before it’s too late, and all that’s remaining are game highlights and jerseys in the rafters.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the April 20, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77108\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/not-defined-by-the-dime-the-transformation-of-the-1/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77108\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/not-defined-by-the-dime-the-transformation-of-the-1/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/not-defined-by-the-dime-the-transformation-of-the-1/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/not-defined-by-the-dime-the-transformation-of-the-1/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/not-defined-by-the-dime-the-transformation-of-the-1/","id":1911,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1910,1909,1908],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White","biography":"Not available","articles":[163,251,282,290,292,293,300,302,311,312,314,315,316,327,328,329,337,338,340,341,343,345,347,349,350,351,353,356,357,361,362,363,364,365,368,370,372,373,375,376,379,381,382,385,387,389,391,392,393,395,396,398,401,406,407,408,414,426,447,452,453,455,468,471,487,488,492,504,506,507,513,517,528,529,530,583,585,601,674,975,1208,1363,1415,1428,1430,1443,1473,1775,1776,1777,1872,1873,1881,1886,1889,1890,1893,1908,1911,1914,1971,1974,1984,1993,2005,2020,2021,2025,2849,3280,3283,3284,3290,3298,3299,3304,3306,3310,3322,3323,3325,3338,3381,4102,4954,4981,4988,4991,4996,5041,5044,5049,5055,5070,5071,5072,5073,5074,5075,5076,5077,5079,5080,5081,5082,5088,5089,5097,5098,5120,5121,5151,5152,5317,5340,5342,5343,5345,5347,5349,5365,5367,5368,5369,5371,5384,5387,5388,5389,5390,5391,5393,5394,5395,5401,5479,5509,5543],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"In Photos | The Last Paw-ty Before Finals: Dog Therapy Day Returns","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-11-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Dog-Therapy_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-4-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Dog-Therapy_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-4-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Hoards of students swarmed Ellison Lawn, taking much needed breaks from studying.

According to Harris, the Cave Fire is burning “under some of the toughest firefighting conditions anywhere in the world,” a product of an intense dry season and low humidity index. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara County Fire Unit Chief Scotty Jalpert noted that the firefighting resources used to combat the Cave Fire have come “from Monterrey to San Bernardino.” Despite the prediction of rain in the coming days, “it’s not over yet,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Santa Barbara County Battalion Chief Anthony Stornetta, operations to “box in” the fire began this morning, when multiple fixed wing aircraft were deployed to suppress the fire and form a perimeter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown noted that over 5,400 people have been evacuated as a result of the Cave Fire and will likely remain evacuated through today. According to a tweet sent out by the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office at 11:44 a.m. on Tuesday, evacuation orders “for the areas West of Patterson to Fairview and North of Cathedral Oaks” have been lifted but all others remain in place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caltrans </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CaltransD5/status/1199344012768890881\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announced</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at 7:00 a.m. on Tuesday that Highway 154 remains closed, and that drivers should expect increased traffic on Highway 101, particularly due to the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students still on campus and in Isla Vista reported seeing ash on the ground and the air smelling smoky, recalling memories of the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/in-photos-ucsb-students-bike-through-ash-prepare-for-finals-amid-socal-fires/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2017 Thomas Fire</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, when air quality was deemed “unhealthy” during dead week in December. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the </span><a href=\"https://www.ourair.org/todays-air-quality/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">air quality</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is considered “good” in Santa Barbara and “moderate” in Goleta, the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department and the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District issued an </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/OurAirSBC/status/1199372164639539200/photo/1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">air quality warning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the county on Tuesday at 9:00 a.m., writing that smoke and ash from the fire were affecting the local air quality and that “conditions may continue over the next several days.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The warning cautioned residents — particularly people with heart or lung disease, older adults, pregnant women and children — from spending time outdoors, and recommended wearing N95 masks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Direct Relief, a global humanitarian organization based in Santa Barbara, </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DirectRelief/status/1199354963673014272\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it would have N95 masks available to the public at its headquarters at 6100 Wallace Becknell Road between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday.

I think the NCAA put [the rules] in place for competitive equity [to] make sure there’s not drug use that then potentially enhances performance, which creates an inequity [on] the playing field,” Barsky said. “The institutional drug policies and procedures may provide some of that, but it’s also to provide support for student-athlete health and wellness.”</p>\n<p>It is this dimension of health and wellness that has distinguished the foundation of UCSB’s drug policies and procedures, aiding their emphasis on not leaving student-athletes in the position to come to conclusions through trial and error, but rather with “drug education, prevention and testing.”</p>\n<p>Although the Intercollegiate Athletics (ICA) building serves as most UCSB student-athletes’ sanctuary for their needs, ensuring that they are also aware of the multitude of on-campus resources is one of the primary components on Barsky’s agenda.</p>\n<p>“My primary function is to provide oversight and support to a lot of our internal components within the [athletics] department,” Barsky said. “[This includes] sports medicine, sport performance, our collaboration with academic services, NCAA compliance [and] student advisory council. Anything pertaining to providing internal support or collaboration with the student athlete experience.”</p>\n<p>Busy with practice, games, traveling, courses and catching up on homework to remain eligible for play all while trying to maintain a social life, the student-athlete experience includes an intensified form of the typical student’s yearn for balance and time for self.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77179\" style=\"width: 341px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/?attachment_id=77179\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-77179\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77179\" data-attachment-id=\"77179\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/ucsbs-drug-policy-aims-to-enhance-and-cater-to-the-student-athlete-experience/drug-policty/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?fit=1583%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1583,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"drug policty\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?fit=193%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?fit=792%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-77179\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty-792x1024.jpg?resize=331%2C428\" alt=\"\" width=\"331\" height=\"428\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?resize=792%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 792w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?resize=193%2C250&amp;ssl=1 193w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?resize=768%2C994&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/drug-policty.jpg?w=1583&amp;ssl=1 1583w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77179\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Nathan Campos / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The array of responsibilities can be overwhelmingly stressful, especially with the prevalence of peer pressure or the temptations that exist within Isla Vista that sometimes lead to violations and misconduct.</p>\n<p>An awareness of these temptations is necessary as student-athletes are provided with no timetable concerning the frequency of drug testing throughout the regular or off seasons.</p>\n<p>“The NCAA as well as the institutional drug policy has random testing dates,” Barsky said. “There’s no schedule or schedule per sport. We can be notified or student-athletes can be notified anytime that there will be a test within a 24-hour period. The [athletics] department works with Drug Free Sport, which is the same company that administers drug testing for the NCAA.”</p>\n<p>Although the NCAA lays out the foundation for institutions to follow, UCSB’s drug policy prides itself on providing student-athletes with resources that are not only primarily concerned with performance but the overall mental and physical health as well.</p>\n<p>“I think the institutional structure provides a little more support. Again, you’re still [subject to] year-round random selection, but if you’re selected and there’s a positive test, there’s a process for support and potentially rehabilitation,” Barsky said. “Your first sanction is to follow the process of working with the alcohol and drug program. A second positive [or more] will lead to sanctions within your playing season, but it’s also to provide and use counseling services. The NCAA doesn’t have those supports in place like we have as an institution.”</p>\n<p>“We use the drug testing policy as well as a lot of resources. Services such as student health, the alcohol and drug program and C.A.P.S. We try to use our resources to provide the best education to student-athletes about drugs, alcohol and choices in general. The policy is an accountability method to ensure that they are following and complying with the NCAA rules and mandates it takes to be a student-athlete.”</p>\n<p>Although Barsky and her staff cannot monitor student-athletes’ every choice and action, instilling drug policies and procedures that are educational and relying applicable information is significant to them considering the longevity of their health both now and in the future.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s intercollegiate athletics handbook concerning student-athlete drug policies and procedures can be found here:<em> http://ucsb.prestosports.com/general/2016-17/files/2016_17_UCSB_ICA_Drug_Education_and_Prevention_Program_Policy_and_Procedures_Final.pdf</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the April 20, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77178\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/ucsbs-drug-policy-aims-to-enhance-and-cater-to-the-student-athlete-experience/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77178\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/ucsbs-drug-policy-aims-to-enhance-and-cater-to-the-student-athlete-experience/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/ucsbs-drug-policy-aims-to-enhance-and-cater-to-the-student-athlete-experience/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/ucsbs-drug-policy-aims-to-enhance-and-cater-to-the-student-athlete-experience/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/ucsbs-drug-policy-aims-to-enhance-and-cater-to-the-student-athlete-experience/","id":1908,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1907,1906,1905],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
