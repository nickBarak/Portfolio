Halloween website, street parking will be prohibited starting at 9 a.m. on Friday, Oct. 27, until 6 a.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 1, on the 6500, 6600 and 6700 blocks of Del Playa Drive, the 6500 block of Trigo Road and between Del Playa Drive and Trigo Road on Camino Pescadero, Camino Del Sur and El Embarcadero Road.</p>\n<p>Cars parked on the 6500 block of El Nido Road and on the 6500, 6600 and 6700 blocks of Sabado Tarde Road do not need to be moved over this time period, but roadblocks will be placed on those blocks to prevent cars from entering and exiting.</p>\n<p><strong>UCSB</strong></p>\n<p>According to the A.S. Halloween website, visitors are not allowed to park on campus.</p>\n<p>Vehicles parked on campus without a matching permit are subject to a $300 citation and towing.</p>\n<p>Students with a Night &amp; Weekend (N&amp;W) Parking Permit will be able to park on campus from 11 a.m. on Friday to 7:30 a.m. on Wednesday. Lots 22, 18, 16, 30 and 38 will be the only lots open for parking over the weekend.</p>\n<p>N&amp;W permits purchased in the fall cost $52.50 plus a $5.95 shipping charge. Permits are sold year round, but students had to apply for a parking permit by Oct. 15 to have it shipped in time for the coming weekend. Each student may only purchase one permit.</p>\n<p>The only valid permits for overnight parking — between 5 p.m. and 7:30 a.m. — are special event permits, N&amp;W, Isla Vista Access permit for Lot 22 (IVA 22) or faculty and staff permits.</p>\n<p>IVA 22 is a valid permit for Lot 22.</p>\n<p>Only 100 of these permits were available for “community members, UCSB staff, faculty, and non-resident students,” according to the Associated Students’ Halloween tip website.</p>\n<p>Last year, Transportation &amp; Parking Services offered a 50 percent discount for the N&amp;W permits prior to the Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>Nestor Covarrubias, director of Transportation &amp; Parking Services, said they decided not to renew the discount this year because they believe the permit price is already fair.</p>\n<p>“The Night and Weekend parking permit is a good value, allowing access to campus for the entire academic year,” Covarrubias said in an email. “The equivalent cost to purchase daily passes for the Halloween period alone would come out to $32.”</p>\n<p>Transportation &amp; Parking Services has sold 354 N&amp;W permits this year. The department sold 465 permits by this time last year, Covarrubias said.</p>\n<p>According to Covarrubias, Transportation &amp; Parking Services issued 95 parking citations between Oct. 28 and Oct. 30 last year. He said 94 of the citations were issued at $48, and one was issued at $238 because the vehicle was parked in front of a fire hydrant.</p>\n<p><strong>GOLETA</strong></p>\n<p>According to Valerie Kushnerov, community relations manager for the City of Goleta, between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. Friday through Sunday, street parking will be limited to residents with parking permits for the weekend. Two such parking permits were sent to each Goleta household in preparation.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 26, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

Senator Kian Maalizadeh authored the resolution to provide funding for students unable to travel home because of financial issues. <em>Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kian Maalizadeh, transfer senator and fourth-year biology major, created the resolution on Dec. 8. Ilene Ochoa, an off-campus senator and fourth-year communication major, seconded the resolution, which was later passed through an email vote on Dec. 10.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email votes are usually used only in emergency situations, Maalizadeh said. Senators used an email vote because the fire grew quickly after their last planned meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the resolution, the Senate will take $5,000 from their unallocated fund which is made up of student fees, and a detailed list of what was purchased will be sent back to Associated Students (A.S.). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maalizadeh said the resolution was made intentionally vague because he anticipates that many  unforeseen problems could arise during the fire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he created the resolution because he wanted to show A.S.’s support for the students affected by the fire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of students were calling UC admin saying they couldn’t leave, they couldn’t afford to leave; they were stuck, basically in the pollution,” Maalizadeh said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said A.S. released polls asking students if they needed aid to get off campus, and the overall response was “yes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The deadline to request funds was 10:30 a.m. on Dec. 14 so that the Financial Crisis Response Team could process checks in a “timely manner,” according to Maalizadeh. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Senators posted on Facebook about the resolution and told students to email A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez by the deadline if they needed transportation funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Márquez forwarded the students’ full names and student identification numbers to the university’s Financial Crisis Response Team, which then decided how much money a student would be awarded for transportation on a case-by-case basis, Maalizadeh said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Out of the $5,000 that was allocated, $2,800 was used as of Dec. 14, according to Michael Miller, assistant vice chancellor for enrollment services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who responded by the 10:30 a.m. Thursday deadline were able to pick up checks at 3 p.m. from the BARC office, Miller said. Students who responded after that deadline but before 10:30 a.m. Friday can pick up their checks by 3 p.m. today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller said the amount of money given to students depended on their destination and was based off the cost of a Amtrak ticket.

Jimenez, a second-year undeclared major at UC Santa Barbara, settled on the idea for her interactive sculpture due to the recent impact of the movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez said in an email that the #MeToo Twitter hashtag recognizes how many people, mostly women, are sexually assaulted and “exposes the alarming numbers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez said the project has a great deal of personal significance to her because she is a survivor of sexual assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said she found it very difficult to acknowledge and speak of her experience, but that she regained a sense of hope and power after seeing the #MeToo movement trending on Twitter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When designing the project, Jimenez was initially worried that simply posting a large sign with the hashtag would be too obvious, but quickly noticed that many students were still unaware of the meaning behind the viral campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t want people to think that I was trying to turn a subject that’s so important and disgusting into just a pretty photo opp or something ‘aesthetic,’” she said in the email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez said she believed it would be powerful to see how many flowers stacked up on her art piece, representing how many people have been affected by sexual assault directly or indirectly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students choose to complete their projects off campus in Isla Vista, but Jimenez said for her that was not an option.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I insisted on my piece being on campus because that’s the main audience I wanted to view my piece: my own peers,” Jimenez wrote in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:

difficulty of getting permission from the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez decided not to submit a request to display her piece on the Storke Tower

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Jimenez could be creative with the idea and creation of the project, she said she is grateful for the input and help she received along the way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the project would not have been possible without the support of three people: her professor, her aunt who owns a Carpinteria flower shop and UCSB woodshop technician Michael Matheson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez said she has mostly received positive responses to her piece, yet some people are still unaware of the topic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that students have also responded positively on social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All positive responses so
