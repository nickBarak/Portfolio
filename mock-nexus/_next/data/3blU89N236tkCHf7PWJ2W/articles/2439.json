UC Santa Barbara is the first UC campus to host her.</p>\n<p>“Dear brothers and sisters,” she began, a phrase she repeated multiple times. “I am so proud to be here.”</p>\n<p>She expressed her “sadness and anger” at violent events that have occurred in Syria, especially those in her region, such as the recent chemical weapons attack in Syria that she blamed on Assad’s tyrannical regime.</p>\n<p>She focused her lecture on tyranny and the Arab Spring, which she described as a “response to the decay of justice.”</p>\n<p>“Our revolution is not a fleeting whim, but needs that we have had for many years,” she said.</p>\n<p>Karman organized student rallies in Sana’a, the largest city in Yemen and was imprisoned several times in 2011. In Yemen’s opposition movement, she is known as the “Iron Woman” and described going to prison as the “best moment of [her] life.”</p>\n<p>“They were stupid when they took me to the jail, because it made me very strong,” she said.</p>\n<p>Karman’s incarceration led to Yemeni people rioting in the streets, calling for her release and repeating her chants, which engaged students in the revolution.</p>\n<p>She also spoke about both President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama, expressing her disappointment with their relationships with Syria.</p>\n<p>When asked about her views of Obama, she said she “expected a lot from him, as a human,” but found herself disappointed.</p>\n<p>“I blame him on the bloodshed in Syria,” she said. “I believe that he could stop the bloodshed.”</p>\n<p>Despite this, Karman said she respects him and believes he did great things within the U.S.</p>\n<p>Karman went on to criticize President Trump’s travel ban, which she called a violation of international human rights and “values as an American.”</p>\n<p>“Whoever brands Muslims with terror is not only lying and ignorant, he is directly and indirectly helping terrorism,” she said.</p>\n<p>She also spoke about how religion was used against her and other women who tried to demonstrate.</p>\n<p>“Dictators use religion to build walls between nations,” she said. “All of us should be against the bad religious people who translate religion in a bad way.”</p>\n<p>She urged the audience to take responsibility to protect their values, including “peace, love, coexistence and democracy.”</p>\n<p>Karman spoke extensively about terrorism and said despotism and terrorism are two sides of the same coin.</p>\n<p>According to Karman, the Western “catastrophic failure” in the Iraq War created conditions for the Islamic State (I.S.). She also said she believes Assad created I.S. to stop the peaceful Syrian revolution.</p>\n<p>“Silence has given Assad the permission to keep killing the Syrian people,” she said. “We don’t accept any choice between terrorism and despotism. The only choice we will make and we will win and we will struggle for is democracy.”</p>\n<p>Karman did express hope for the future and said university students are a part of the generation “that will protect the world better than we are doing now.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t let anyone to steal your values,” she said to the students in the audience. “You are the creator of the future, my son, my daughter. Be a leader; the world needs you.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Constitution was spearheaded by A.S. President Austin Hechler and aims to decrease student fees by lowering UC Santa Barbara’s contributions to outside organizations. The UC Student Association (UCSA) and the United States Student Association (USSA), national and statewide student organizations, have been scrutinized due to UCSB paying higher than average fees.</p>\n<p>For fiscal year 2016-2017, UCSB A.S. paid $173,139 in dues to UCSA, $89,874 more than the next highest payer, UCLA A.S., which paid $83,265 according to the UCSA budget. The lowest contributor, UC Merced A.S., only paid $7,944.</p>\n<p>UCSB A.S. pays for over 30 percent of UCSA’s annual budget.</p>\n<p>UCSB students also pay much higher dues to USSA, a national student organization. The website states that schools pay an average of 50 cents to $1 per student, while UCSB pays over $7 per student per year.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75805\" style=\"width: 543px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75805\" data-attachment-id=\"75805\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/a-s-aims-to-lower-student-fees/graphic2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/graphic2.jpg?fit=533%2C631&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"533,631\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"graphic2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/graphic2.jpg?fit=211%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/graphic2.jpg?fit=533%2C631&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75805\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/graphic2.jpg?resize=533%2C631\" alt=\"\" width=\"533\" height=\"631\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/graphic2.jpg?w=533&amp;ssl=1 533w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/graphic2.jpg?resize=211%2C250&amp;ssl=1 211w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-75805\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The referendum states that “fee referendums may not exceed the average payment per student in member campuses of external organizations.” This does not prevent A.S. from entering or withdrawing from membership or senate allocating additional money to membership organizations.</p>\n<p>Hechler hopes that this referendum will make contributions fair, instead of having UCSB shoulder a majority of the cost.</p>\n<p>“We shouldn’t be paying over three times as much as the next highest school,” Hechler said. “It’s not fair that UCSB students have to bear the burden of paying for this entire association.”</p>\n<p>Hechler said A.S. has informed both UCSA and USSA of the referendum and is collaborating with them to ensure that their organizations are prepared and are able to be sustained despite the decrease in funding.</p>\n<p>Another amendment addresses the addition of new student fees, increasing the percentage of votes necessary to put a fee on the ballot. Currently, new A.S. fees that are on the ballot by student petition need only 51 percent to be added, while fees that are put on by Senate need 60 percent. The referendum would increase the votes necessary for all new fees to two-thirds.</p>\n<p>This referendum also makes it more difficult for student fees to be increased and reaffirmed. Existing lock-in fees must be reaffirmed every two years. The new legislation would mandate that fees that are up for reaffirmation must pass by 60 percent, while fees on the ballot for an increase must pass by 66 percent.</p>\n<p>These amendments will be sent to Elections Committee and will go through Senate at the end of the quarter before being sent to the UC Office of the President.</p>\n<p>The final bylaw proposes a cap on the amount spent by the Finance and Business Committee on conferences.</p>\n<p>Currently, A.S. Financial Policies and Procedures do not allow non-A.S. organizations to use A.S. funds for expenses related to off-campus conferences. Organizations that want to use funding for conferences can use a one-time exception allowing them to get the funding they need.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t make sense that a huge portion of the finance and business budget goes towards an exception to the rules. We need to either modify the rules or limit spending,” Ian Caples, A.S. Director of Budget and Finance, said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75804\" style=\"width: 626px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75804\" data-attachment-id=\"75804\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/a-s-aims-to-lower-student-fees/student-fees-graphic/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/student-fees-graphic.jpg?fit=616%2C563&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"616,563\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"student fees graphic\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/student-fees-graphic.jpg?fit=250%2C228&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/student-fees-graphic.jpg?fit=616%2C563&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75804\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/student-fees-graphic.jpg?resize=616%2C563\" alt=\"\" width=\"616\" height=\"563\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/student-fees-graphic.jpg?w=616&amp;ssl=1 616w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/student-fees-graphic.jpg?resize=250%2C228&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-75804\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The current proposal is to create a separate category specifically for conferences totaling $70,000, with a $150 per person cap. In previous years, around $80,000 was allocated towards conferences.</p>\n<p>Finance and Business Committee Chair Reilly Hobson emphasized that the goal of this bylaw was not to decrease student fees but to limit the amount of money spent off campus.</p>\n<p>“I think students don’t realize that the money that Finance and Business Committee has is coming from student fees,” Hobson said. “They think it’s from the university, and then we have to dispense it. It’s actually from students, so when they’re asking for like $600 per student to go to a conference, that’s like three people paying for one person to go.”</p>\n<p>Justice Dumlao, co-chair of the A.S. Queer Commission, said he believes a cap on conference spending will negatively affect minority students.</p>\n<p>“I think that limiting the spending on conferences is very detrimental to a lot of minority communities because a lot of the learning and community building and healing come from going to conferences,” Dumlao said. “I think in trying to limit that you are, in turn, oppressing the communities that you say you are supporting.”</p>\n<p>A.S.

His item of interest: a bright red, wooden phallus measuring about two feet long with dark hair sprouting out of the base.</p>\n<p>The story behind the phallus begins in Bhutan, a small country located between India and China, which was greatly influenced by Tibetan Buddhism. Early in Bhutan’s history, it was believed a mad yogi named Drukpa Kunley traveled from Tibet and drew crowds with his crazy antics.</p>\n<p>His greatest skill was seducing female demons with his charisma and “defeating” them with his phallus.</p>\n<p>To this day, the people of Bhutan still celebrate Drukpa’s genitals. Hillis has taken several trips to Bhutan.</p>\n<p>“There are pictures of his penis everywhere,” he said. “Then you will see [phalluses] just hanging in people’s homes and temples to ward off demons.”</p>\n<p>He bought his phallus from a local shop in Bhutan. Hillis has used it as a prop in his Tibetan religion and intro to religion classes.</p>\n<p>“When I would show the class, some of the smart alecks would respond with ‘it’s a dildo,’” Hillis said.</p>\n<p>The phallus definitely grabbed his students’ attention. However, Hillis said it represents something different than a dildo: “Sex and the power of procreation is holy, and it’s amazing … What makes a religion a religion is that it is connected in some way to what people think is holy or sacred.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74265\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74265\" data-attachment-id=\"74265\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/a-peek-through-professors-office-doors/candace-waid-online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Candace-Waid-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=1500%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"candace-waid-online-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Candace-Waid-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Candace-Waid-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-74265 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Candace-Waid-ONLINE-1-768x1024.jpg?resize=768%2C1024\" alt=\"candace-waid-online-1\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Candace-Waid-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Candace-Waid-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Candace-Waid-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-74265\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Rebekah Akiyoshi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>The Colors of Candace Waid’s Office</strong><br>\nBright colors of red, yellow and green illuminate the walls of Candace Waid’s office.

Also notable, she is the author of The Signifying Eye: Seeing Faulkner’s Art, an in-depth study of William Faulkner’s abstract art.</p>\n<p>These paintings and drawings were all given to her as gifts from former students, some who went on to become painters. Asked why students give her art, she said, “they know I care about color, and I’m all about paintings.” Some of the titles of the paintings in her office include “Alien Corn,” “Oklahoma Alabama” and “Guadalupe.”</p>\n<p>A still-life above Waid’s computer is credited as the work of a past first-year student, Natalie O’Brien. She credits O’Brien for founding The Catalyst, a magazine of poems, stories and art submitted by UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Together, they worked on the “digital fires of the Internet” to study ekphrasis, art expressing another form of art, like a poem talking about a painting.</p>\n<p>“These paintings bring joy to me.

The hero of the story, Beowulf, takes on the dark monster, Grendel.</p>\n<p>“Beowulf is taking on the dark side … you have to take on the opposing forces of evil … often take the form of a relative,” she said.</p>\n<p>Fumerton uses this comparison in her classes because “as students hear it, they connect very quickly.” She loves to connect bigger concepts like good versus evil back to students’ lives.</p>\n<p>“I treasure these plastic gifts, because they mean the student gets it, and it means enough to them that they want to give me a memento … it’s my connection to the students,” Fumerton said. “Whenever I look at him, I remember how fun it was teaching <em>Beowulf</em>.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74278\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74278\" data-attachment-id=\"74278\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/a-peek-through-professors-office-doors/professor-lee-by-josh-ortiz-online-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"professor-lee-by-josh-ortiz-online-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74278\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Josh Ortiz / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-74278\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Josh Ortiz / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>Remembering WWI with John W.I. Lee</strong><br>\nJohn W.I. Lee is an associate professor at UCSB and has worked here for the past 16 years. He is currently on leave writing his book and taking care of his new baby, born this past summer. In his office, Lee displays an array of 10 helmets from World War I.</p>\n<p>These helmets are a timeline of steel integration. Before the war, people had romantic ideas of war and wore decorative caps that did not protect their heads. As trench warfare increased, so did reported head injuries.</p>\n<p>Lee highlights a specific helmet called the French Adrian, which was the first mass-produced steel helmet in Europe.</p>\n<p>“We are living in a world shaped by the outcome of WWI,” said Lee, who studies changing warfare throughout history.</p>\n<p>For the past year, Lee has been working on a project to commemorate the 100th anniversary of WWI. He invited first-year student Sydney Martin to help with extensive research and report write-ups. The project will be an exhibition to display the helmets for UCSB students to view firsthand.</p>\n<p>“There is nothing better to educate others than having them see it up front and personal,” Lee said.</p>\n<p>Lee is borrowing these helmets from a local collector in Santa Barbara, who is interested in history and student learning. For those interested in learning more about WWI, this exhibition will be on display on the first floor of the UCSB library in November.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74221\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74221\" data-attachment-id=\"74221\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/a-peek-through-professors-office-doors/6o2a8930/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"6o2a8930\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74221\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-74221\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>Samuel Sweet’s Botanical Indoor Garden</strong><br>\nSamuel Sweet is a professor of ecology and evolution who knows a few things about keeping plants alive. On the far side of his office sit two pots of around 20 fan palms, all standing over six feet tall. The backstory for these palms’ installment begins on a somber note.</p>\n<p>About a year and a half ago, a row of eucalyptus trees stood outside of Sweet’s office. These trees were about 150 years old and over 150 feet tall.</p>\n<p>“Idiots cut [the row] down so they could park a few construction trucks while building the new bioengineering building,” Sweet said.</p>\n<p>Without the trees, sunlight caused hot temperatures in his office during the afternoon. The construction company offered to paint over the office’s windows, but Sweet olitely declined the offer. Now, the palms serve an important purpose for the office of this professor: to keep the sun out.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74316\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/a-peek-through-professors-office-doors/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74316\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/a-peek-through-professors-office-doors/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/a-peek-through-professors-office-doors/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/a-peek-through-professors-office-doors/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/a-peek-through-professors-office-doors/","id":2438,"author":{"id":103,"name":"Rebekah Akiyoshi"},"related":[2437,2436,2435],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
