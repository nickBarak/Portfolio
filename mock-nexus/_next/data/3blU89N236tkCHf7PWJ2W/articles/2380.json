Among them, the McNair Scholars Program may face the steepest cut.</p>\n<p>The McNair Post Baccalaureate Achievement is a federal scholarship offered to first-generation, low-income students or those who belong to underrepresented minorities in the United States. By pushing these students toward doctoral degrees, the program hopes to diversify faculty in universities across the country.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara began the McNair program in 2007, and it has since guided over 50 students to masters and Ph.D. programs. Though UCSB houses a smaller department than other universities, current and former McNair scholars say their education would have been impossible without it.</p>\n<p>Jamelia Harris, a first-year doctoral student at UC Los Angeles, graduated from UCSB last year with the university’s highest honors — the Thomas More Storke Award. She began her first year at UCSB as a biochemistry major, but she said the McNair program guided her to understand the impact of research as a social scientist.</p>\n<p>“Ph.D.s are nonexistent in my network of family members and friends,” Harris said. Growing up in a predominantly black, low-resource community in Lancaster, Calif., she said she was always “tracked” into higher level courses.</p>\n<p>Her experiences, and those of her family, led her to pursue research in segregated education within the same community. She now focuses on black female’s vulnerability to policing and discrimination in schooling.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78222\" style=\"width: 688px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"670327053\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78283\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78222\" data-attachment-id=\"78222\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/mcnair-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg?fit=1356%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1356,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"McNair 3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg?fit=678%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78222 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3-678x1024.jpg?resize=678%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"678\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg?resize=678%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 678w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1160&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-3.jpg?w=1356&amp;ssl=1 1356w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78222\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Volumes of research from McNair scholars are arranged on a bookshelf. <em>Hugh Cook/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have not met a student of color across all six schools [I was admitted to] who was admitted directly from undergrad without the support of McNair,” she said. “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that speaks volumes to the level of support that McNair offers for many of us who are first-generation college students.”</span></p>\n<p>Though McNair has guided several students from their second undergraduate year to a Ph.D., the White House believes its progress is inefficient. In an off-camera briefing on May 22, the Office of Management and Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney, said the McNair program had not accomplished its objectives.</p>\n<p>“The last time the Department of Education looked at this, it was 6 percent effective — 6 percent,” Mulvaney said.  “I can’t do that anymore.  We can’t do that anymore.  We cannot defend programs like that — 6 percent just doesn’t cut it.”</p>\n<p>Beth Schneider, UCSB McNair program chair, said Mulvaney’s statement lacks context. When she read the proposal, she said, “I was shocked — but not surprised.”</p>\n<p>Approximately 1 percent of undergraduates graduating in 2005 earned their doctorate by 2015, according to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In comparison, Schneider said, a 6 percent doctorate rate for McNair scholars is a vast improvement.</p>\n<p>Still, the U.S. Department of Education (D.O.E.) report says “McNair is a high cost per-participant program that serves relatively few students.” There is limited evidence of effectiveness for both of these programs,” the<a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget18/summary/18summary.pdf\"> report</a> reads.</p>\n<p>Schneider acknowledged that this is true — the McNair program serves a niche group of students at a high cost — but explained that it is essential to prompt students toward a graduate education if they are to return to UCSB as a diverse group of educators.</p>\n<p>Syrian Truong, a transfer student who plans to apply to graduate school next year, began the McNair program after moving to Santa Barbara from Fresno. Truong is gay, a first-generation student and a multiracial Asian-Latino American. For people who don’t experience educational barriers as a part of their daily life, he said, the value of structural support is difficult to explain.</p>\n<p>“There’s a certain amount of condescension as you start moving higher and higher up … you look around and you start seeing less and less of people that look like you,” he said. “For me, that was never a problem before, but it starts to get grating.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78223\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1357638069\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78283\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78223\" data-attachment-id=\"78223\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/mcnair-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1357&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1357\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"McNair 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?fit=888%2C589&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78223 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1-1024x679.jpg?resize=888%2C589\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"589\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C679&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/McNair-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78223\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photos of McNair scholars and faculty advisors line the walls of the McNair program trailer next the Veteran Resource Center at UCSB. <em>Hugh Cook/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The concept of graduate school appealed to Truong as a first-year at UCSB, but he said it would have been “a much harder road” without the McNair program. He now does research in theoretical physics, specifically through condensed matter theory and statistical mechanics, and is looking toward a Ph.D.</p>\n<p>“If that support was given to other students …  maybe it doesn’t bring the next Einstein,” he said. “But it could bring a lot of good change, inventions and a lot of progress in the world.”</p>\n<p>The D.O.E. currently allows McNair scholars 10 years to complete their Ph.D. Each university records and submits its own data, but according to McNair supporters, the D.O.E. has not consolidated this data properly. As a result, the D.O.E. report used possibly outdated information spanning from 1989 to 2000.</p>\n<p>Schneider said the D.O.E.<a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/highered/mcnair/mcnair.pdf\"> study</a> does not match trends at UCSB, where each cohort since 2007 has either surpassed the 6 percent doctorate rate or is well on its way to meeting this percentage.</p>\n<p>Last year, Harris and several other students spoke to UC President Janet Napolitano to push for a more proportionate number of faculty to match the amount of black Californians.</p>\n<p>“If we have the president of an entire University of California admittedly saying that these programs are necessary for the improving the retention and recruitments of faculty of colors,  I personally don’t see why our actions aren’t embodying those sentiments,” she said.</p>\n<p>After the federal budget was proposed last week, Napolitano spoke out against the proposed cuts. Though she focused on rollbacks to the National Science Foundation and energy science programs, she said the proposed cuts could affect more than 133,000 UC students.</p>\n<p>“As president of the nation’s largest public research university, I urge Congress to immediately begin work on a revised budget proposal that makes meaningful investments to help our students, protect our patients and keep America’s research enterprise preeminent,” Napolitano said in a statement.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, June 1, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78283\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78283\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/mcnair-program-could-be-slashed/","id":2380,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2379,2378,2377],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli","biography":"Not available","articles":[2332,2347,2356,2359,2380,2387,2428,2433,2440,2446,2452,2460,2463,2464,2468,2470,2474,2484,2497,2510,2521,2528,2555,2569,2573,2626,2627,2628,2642,2706,2745,2751,2753,2756,2766,2770,2806,2836,2975,2979,2987,2993,3451,3593,3596,3759,3762,3765,3899,3901,3909,3963,3965,3969,3986,4462,4464,4483,4505,4521,4623,4647,4699,4768],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Once ‘At-Risk Youth’ Dela Cruz Receives UCSB’s Highest Honor","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0350.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_0350.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Dela Cruz has served several positions in A.S., is currently completing her thesis on the history of the Ventura School for Girls and will be graduating with a bachelor's degree in history of public p...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Paola Dela Cruz was once considered an “at risk” youth; she used to get in fights, routinely show up late to class and fail to turn in homework assignments.

Yang. The Storke Award is the highest accolade a student can receive at UCSB. <em>Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I am a real-life example of second opportunities and believing in the potential of kids despite what is happening around them,” she said.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz tells people with pride that she is from Compton. She sees a great deal of similarity between Compton and Isla Vista, especially in the negative narratives that have come out of both communities.</p>\n<p>Compton’s reputation of crime and violence had, for a long time, kept her from sharing about her hometown. It was during her time at UCSB, however, that she learned to embrace Compton and to take pride in the “solidarity between black and brown people” there.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz was just a freshman during the Deltopia riots and the Isla Vista shooting of May 23, 2014, which both occurred within a month of each other. The news coverage portrayed I.V. with a lot of “negativity,” she said, and she began to see the same narrative come out of I.V. as with Compton.</p>\n<p>From then on, Dela Cruz set out to make known the positive aspects of Isla Vista: its “wonderful” parks and the children and families that live here alongside college students.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz was elected as an Associated Students (A.S.) senator in 2014 and sworn in days before the shooting. Later that year she won election as a board director with the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD), which was, at the time, the only government agency in I.V.</p>\n<p>Having served a year with IVRPD and A.S. Senate, Dela Cruz sought election as the A.S. external vice president of local affairs (EVPLA).</p>\n<p>As EVPLA, she created the Beloved Community Conference, an annual meeting for Isla Vista residents to voice their experiences and concerns.</p>\n<p>However, her term was characterized largely by her outreach to I.V.’s Latinx families, which she said exist behind a “barrier” beyond the community of college students in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“It’s not about, ‘These poor families; they need our help.’ It’s not about that. It’s about, ‘How can we work together and help together?’” she said. “Let’s just talk. We’re friends, we’re just ‘gente,’ we’re ‘raza.’ Let’s just get together and talk.”</p>\n<p>The Storke Award recipient is selected by a committee appointed and chaired by Margaret Klawunn, the vice chancellor of student affairs.</p>\n<p>The committee looks for graduating seniors who have demonstrated outstanding scholarship and extraordinary service to the university and its students. Katya Armistead, dean of the Office of Student Life, said the recipient must demonstrate courage, persistence, achievement and a GPA of 3.5 or above.</p>\n<p>“[Dela Cruz] leads with her heart, but she’s also brilliant. That combination, when you see it in someone, it’s pretty rare,” Professor Rick Benjamin, one of several faculty and staff to nominate Dela Cruz for the Storke Award, said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“[Dela Cruz] leads with her heart, but she’s also brilliant. That combination, when you see it in someone, it’s pretty rare.” -Professor Rick Benjamin</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pegeen Soutar, the chair of the IVRPD board, said that Dela Cruz demonstrates a wonderful understanding of Isla Vista and that long-term residents adore her.</p>\n<p>“I think she just has an outstanding commitment to this community,” Soutar said. “The woman is smart, she’s compassionate, she really listens.”</p>\n<p>Rachel Arriaga, an analyst in the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs and another staff member to nominate Dela Cruz, said Dela Cruz blossomed at UCSB and became a leader in the community.</p>\n<p>“She’s leaving UCSB a better place,” Arriaga said.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz is graduating with a 3.7 GPA, and she is completing her thesis on the history of the Ventura School for Girls, a California state institution established in 1913 for delinquent girls.</p>\n<p>Dela Cruz said she heard that she won the Storke Award after receiving a call from Chancellor Henry T. Yang around midnight over a week ago. She said her first reaction was to hide; she couldn’t believe she had been given the award.</p>\n<p>“All these wonderful women I’ve worked with came to mind,” she said. “The reason why I’m getting it is in so many ways because of you all.”</p>\n<p>After graduation, Dela Cruz plans to participate in the California Capital Fellows Program and work on a graduate degree in public policy from Sacramento State.</p>\n<p>Much further into the future, Dela Cruz says she hopes to attain a law degree and later work with youth who face serious criminal sentences.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on how she’s grown while at UCSB, Dela Cruz said she’s become more comfortable as a woman of color, learning to heed the advice of poet Audre Lorde to “trust [her] gut.”</p>\n<p>“It’s a radical act,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, June 1, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly said Paola Dela Cruz attended a high school in Compton.

The seller made 10 copies of the exact same ticket and sold it to 10 different people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So every day, for the next three days of the festival, it was a race to be the first in line. Only the first ticket would show up as valid, and the other nine would be invalid,” Martitsch said. “So needless to say, this was a terrible experience for me.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delta Leaf Labs, a team developing THC- free marijuana, won the second place prize of $7,500 and the $5,000 Elings award for a total of $12,500 — walking away with the most cash prizes. California recently passed Proposition 64, legalizing marijuana, which leaves them with no close competition anywhere in the state.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wanderlease, a website designed to make subleasing easier, won $5,000 dollars for third place. The six team members are all part of Alpha Kappa Psi, a co-ed professional business fraternity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shikha Sharma, a fourth-year political science major, said he thought of the idea for the website after having a difficult time finding housing while interning in New York. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The people’s choice award went to Collatera, a startup that has created a bandage-type patch which could be applied on diabetic foot ulcers. It heals foot ulcers up to four times faster than similar patches currently on the market. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team won $5,000 as well as a honorary award of $2,500. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team has completed trial studies on mice and will start live clinical trials at Harvard University and Tufts Medical Center this summer. Two members of the team will be moving to the East Coast after they graduate in June. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OrganicMatters received the second honorary award. The team members seek to partner with poultry farmers and collect bird waste to make into fertilizer, which helps the environment by disposing of byproduct in a profitable manner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PhantaField won the third honorary award, and its members are currently developing augmented reality glasses. After the competition, their goal is to make their product into a reality and acquire funding.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With our expertise and my 15 years of semiconductor experience, we think we can solve these problems, but it’s uncovering the next problems that we don’t know about yet that are the real challenges coming up,” Dylan Rodriguez, a graduate student in the technology management program, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Team PhantaField said their mentor, Alexander Fang, former UCSB student and former owner of local company Aurrion, has helped them by sharing his own experiences developing Aurrion at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through Aurrion, Fang developed nanofabrications. While he sold the company to Juniper Networks, a technology company based in Sunnyvale, the company is still focused on nanofabrications.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rodriguez said since Fang sold the company, he has more time on his hands to give back to his alma mater by helping aspiring entrepreneurs through events like New Venture.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“His expertise has been immeasurable. It’s just been great having him as an advisor,” Rodriguez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Master of Technology Management is the main focus of the Technology Management Program. Graduate students in the program must partake in an intensive nine-month program that aims to produce future tech industry leaders and provide them with mentors and advisors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dave Adornetto, Entrepreneurship Program Director at the Technology Management Program, said the courses offered throughout the year help participants prepare for the competition and play a major role in the competitor’s final projects.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two of the finalists, Vince Kuppamala of Collatera and Dylan Rodriguez of PhantaField, are graduate students getting their Master’s degree through this program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kuppamala said the professors in the program are from the top business schools in the U.S., providing the eager students with experienced mentors to learn from.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t think there’s another program like it in the country,” Kuppamala said. “You can get such a great integrated business and technology education.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78153\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-27/scam-free-ticketing-platform-wins-new-venture-competition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78153\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-27/scam-free-ticketing-platform-wins-new-venture-competition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-27/scam-free-ticketing-platform-wins-new-venture-competition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-27/scam-free-ticketing-platform-wins-new-venture-competition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-27/scam-free-ticketing-platform-wins-new-venture-competition/","id":2378,"author":{"id":105,"name":"Jack Hu"},"related":[2377,2376,2375],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Legacies Not Lost: Memorial Scholarships Carry on Dreams of I.V.
