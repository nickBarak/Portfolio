All of these lawsuits also allege violations of the Whistleblower Act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stern’s complaint stems from the alleged ignoring of several reported cases of misconduct that began in late 2015, and is mainly centered around five other officers: former Officer Josh Rothermel, former Officer Jeff Savaglio, former Officer Ryan Smith, Officer David Millard and Officer Amanda Siegel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the lawsuit, Stern says he raised concerns about two fellow officers – Rothermel and Savaglio, who are also mentioned in the other lawsuits – in late 2015, alleging they were “causing safety risks” by not responding to requests for backup, turning off radios and not answering phone calls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After speaking with the two about his concerns, Stern alleges he was approached by Smith, who told him that Stern’s concerns about Rothermel and Savaglio were “not valid” and threatened to write him up for “speaking with an officer under Smith’s command.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This would mark the first of several interactions with Smith regarding officer misconduct; beginning June 2016, Stern alleges Smith gave Rothermel, Savaglio and Siegel preferential treatment. Additionally, as detailed in other suits, Siegel was alleged to be having an extramarital affair with Smith. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stern said that any attempt to address concerns with the three’s behavior – Rothermel and Savaglio’s alleged safety risks and Siegel’s capabilities as an officer – was met with threats from Smith to write Stern up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Less than a year later, in February 2017, Stern alleges he was accused by outside investigators looking into the department of knowing about Rothermel and Savaglio’s “improper conduct,” but failing “to notify a proper supervisor.” He then informed investigators that he had reported the two officers’ conduct to Smith and that Smith had allegedly threatened him in response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the following months, Stern says he was demoted from his position as corporal “without any explanation,” was not chosen for another qualified position and was excluded from receiving an award for his actions during the </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2017/02/01/milo-yiannopoulos-event-canceled-violent-protests-erupt-uc-berkeley/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley riots</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and during the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-15/santa-barbara-community-mourns-lives-lost-in-montecito-mudslides/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Montecito mudslides</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. According to court documents, Stern believes this was because he told investigators about Smith’s alleged misconduct. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from complaints about Smith, Stern also lists several allegations against his superior Millard – who is named as a defendant in the suit, alongside the UC Regents – in court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Stern, Millard allegedly lied on a university audit, ordered a dispatcher to lie to a member of the public, mismanaged the release of a trainee officer, “lacked leader and management abilities” and “refused to address issues related to retaliation against officers who made protected disclosures.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stern additionally alleges that on Aug. 19, 2018, after he reported to Millard that other UCPD officers were “legitimately in fear of Smith,” Millard dismissed Stern’s concerns and refused to “address harassment concerns of his fellow officers.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Millard, like Smith, is also named in the other recent UCPD lawsuits. Stern and the plaintiffs of the other lawsuits accuse Millard of covering for Smith, Savagalio and Rothermel’s behavior. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith has not worked with the UCPD since December 2017; he filed his own lawsuit under the pseudonym John Doe against the department in March 2019, alleging that he was harassed and retailed against by his fellow officers for reporting a number of behaviors within the department. His suit detailed alleged police mockery of Chancellor Henry T. Yang, fellow officers and sexual assault and rape victims by members of the department, as well as racial discrimination and the falsification of sexual assault reports.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stern is being represented by the same lawyers representing the Littles, Signa and Reyes. He is scheduled to appear in court again in December. </span></p>\n<p>“Officer Stern filed for the same reasons his fellow officers have, because the UCSBPD and UC Regents fostered an environment of endemic discrimination,” Stern’s lawyer Antonio Castillo said in an email.</p>\n<p>“He filed because it’s long overdue that the UCSB and UC Regents take responsibility for the harm they allowed to occur.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

This tends to be extremely misleading, especially in sports where numbers don’t quite translate to show a player’s true value.</p>\n<p>When comparing careers as a whole, we generally stick to one golden rule when talking about what number matters most: rings.</p>\n<p>Dan Marino is perhaps the most well-known example in football of how misleading this can be, as the legendary quarterback failed to ever win a ring despite setting just about every passing record there was to set. He would forever be overshadowed by Joe Montana and his four Super Bowl rings, a record for quarterbacks that still stands today.</p>\n<p>It’s not hard to see who the present-day equivalents of Marino and Montana are. Peyton Manning and Tom Brady have followed the same storyline as their predecessors nearly to the tee since they rose to prominence in the early 2000s.</p>\n<p>Brady quickly took up the Montana role, racking up three rings from 2001-2004 as the Patriots dominated the football world with unprecedented postseason success. Over the years, he has made his own individual marks on the record books, albeit nowhere close to the success Manning has had in that respect. However, a fourth Super Bowl win in 2015 brought Brady into a tie with Montana and Terry Bradshaw for the most ever for quarterbacks, further establishing him as potentially the greatest signal-caller of all time.</p>\n<p>On the other side, no matter how well Peyton Manning has done in the regular season, postseason success has almost always found a way to evade him. Whether it’s due to costly interceptions, missed field goals, or freak plays down the stretch, Peyton has managed a 13-13 career playoff record and the most losses of any quarterback, compared to Brady’s magnificent mark of 22-9.</p>\n<p>The key difference between Manning and Marino in the playoffs is the fact that Manning did manage to pull off one Cinderella run in 2006, when his Indianapolis Colts defeated the Chicago Bears 29-17 on a rainy day in Miami. Nevertheless, as he continued rewriting the history books and bringing his MVP tally to an all-time best mark of five, Manning still could never find a way to erase the doubts of his greatness.</p>\n<p>After all, Peyton’s little brother, Eli, who has never come close in the statistics argument, has two rings of his own; ironically, both having been earned against Brady and the Patriots.</p>\n<p>It is too late for Peyton to reach the mark set by Brady and Montana, but this Sunday, his legacy will have everything on the line. Lose, and he likely finishes his career with a 1-3 record in Super Bowls, more evidence for the doubters that more times than not, he failed to get the job done when it mattered most.</p>\n<p>Win, and he gets a John Elway-like send off, potentially ending his career on the highest note possible while finally getting that elusive second ring.</p>\n<p>Ironically, if Peyton wins that second ring, he would be achieving it during what is by far the worst statistical year of his legendary career.</p>\n<p>Just how bad was it? Excluding the 2011 season which he sat out due to multiple neck surgeries, Peyton finished 2015 with the least completions, yards, touchdowns, QB rating and games played of his career. In a game against Cleveland, he broke the all-time record for passing yards minutes before being benched for the first time ever. That was his season in a nutshell.</p>\n<p>Although he was on the field far less than we are accustomed to, when he did play, mistakes were in abundance. He averaged 1.7 interceptions per game, the most since his rookie season, when he averaged 1.75.</p>\n<p>Luckily for Peyton, he gets one more chance to win a ring thanks to the greatest defense he has ever had behind him, a defense that won the Broncos the No. 1 seed in the AFC despite playing with an inconsistent offense that is still searching for  answers.</p>\n<p>Peyton knows better than anyone in this game how defense can win a championship. It was only two years ago that the greatest offensive season in history was demolished 43-8 by the Seattle Seahawks and the league’s top defensive unit.</p>\n<p>It’d be a shame to see him go down like that one more time. Fortunately for his fans, he has looked spryer than he has all season in his last couple performances, looking to have put the plantar fasciitis that forced him to miss time behind him.</p>\n<p>Whatever happens, this Sunday will be a day to remember in the legendary story of Peyton Manning, football’s greatest student.</p>\n<p>Let’s just hope the referee doesn’t ruin things with a controversial coin toss.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67920\" style=\"width: 488px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67920\" data-attachment-id=\"67920\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/battle-of-the-qbs-omaha-meets-the-dab/2016-2-2-football/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?fit=1200%2C900&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,900\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2016 2 2 football\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-67920\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?resize=478%2C359\" alt=\"Emily Zhang/ Daily Nexus\" width=\"478\" height=\"359\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67920\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Emily Zhang/ Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Panther’s Balanced Attack Could Ensure Last Rodeo of Manning Era </strong></p>\n<p><strong>By Sean White</strong></p>\n<p>Despite becoming the first team to win the NFC South in back-to-back seasons last year, Carolina’s 7-8-1 finish to crawl into the playoffs was not an astounding achievement as each team in the division concluded the season with a losing record.</p>\n<p>As part of a mediocre division along with the losses of No. 1 Wide Receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn left ACL and a farewell to nine-year veteran Halfback DeAngelo Williams, ending the Panthers’ coveted dual-threat rushing attack alongside Johnathan Stewart, many were convinced that a lackluster season was in store for Carolina.</p>\n<p>But just like the fearless superhero he has constantly portrayed himself to be, the heroic breakout season of Panthers’ Quarterback Cam Newton has amazed the entire National Football League with his incomparable play on the field to help the Panthers finish with a 15-1 regular season record.</p>\n<p>With “Super Cam” at the helm, it may not be too early for Coach Rivera to consider which finger he will have fitted for his second Super Bowl ring. Yet, it can be assured that the primary objective is earning Carolina its first of the famed piece of jewelry.</p>\n<p>The same applies for Newton, who is in search of his first Super Bowl ring and has helped guide the Carolina Panthers to their second Super Bowl appearance in franchise history. While a Panthers-Patriots rematch of Super Bowl XXXVIII would have made the headlines ever more intriguing for Sunday’s game, the opportunity to see Newton play on the game’s most remarkable stage is just as fascinating.</p>\n<p>He set regular season career-highs in passing touchdowns and passer rating with 35 and 99.4 percent, respectively, while throwing a career-low 10 interceptions. Newton complemented his attack through the air with his rushing abilities as well, registering a career-high 8.2 rush attempts per game while collecting 636 yards and 10 rushing touchdowns.</p>\n<p>While it’s inevitable to dislike the charismatic celebrations and giveaways of footballs to children in the crowd after scoring a touchdown, there remains a lack of attention to the level of proficiency he has consistently played with all season long.</p>\n<p>Specifically, his reliability in the Panthers’ redzone trips on offense have been overlooked. He ranked third in the NFL during the regular season when in opponents’ redzone, throwing for 26 touchdowns and zero interceptions. Nonetheless, Newton has performed best in the fourth quarter of games, registering a 64.3 completion percentage and a 110.4 quarterback rating.</p>\n<p>Just like the calm, cool and collected persona that the QB displays, he has been a vital element in the Panthers’ success on third down helping to extend offensive drives. Carolina’s 42.4 third down conversion percentage ranked seventh in the NFL during the regular season. The Panthers’ offense has increased their efficiency when facing possible three and out situations in the postseason now at a 55.2 percentage.</p>\n<p>If I had the privilege of voting for this year’s MVP it would be in favor of Newton, however, I remain a firm believer in the old adage that ‘defense wins championships.’</p>\n<p>Though Carolina ranked a few spots lower than Denver in total defense, pass yards allowed and rush yards allowed, the Panthers’ mastery of takeaways provides the best balance to their dynamic offense.</p>\n<p>Carolina led the NFL with a plus-20 differential between its takeaways and giveaways. Its defense led the league with a total of 39 takeaways while also garnering league-highs in interceptions with 24 and fumble recoveries with 15.</p>\n<p>Leading the Panthers’ stout defense is three-time First Team All-Pro Middle Linebacker Luke Kuechly. Assisting in either run defense or pass coverage alongside veteran linebacker Thomas Davis, it is Kuechly’s versatility that makes him such a challenge for offenses to gameplan against.</p>\n<p>Supporting Kuechly and the rest of the linebacking core are the members of “Thieves Ave”— the Panthers’ secondary. Led by arguably the best defensive back in the NFL in Josh Norman, the crew is responsible for 15 of the team’s 24 interceptions with safety Kurt Coleman’s seven being tied for the most in the NFC.</p>\n<p>Although Peyton Manning has yet to throw an interception this postseason, the time shall come once he squares off against the Panthers’ defense. Carolina’s defense is predicated around the foundation of takeaways, having already recorded six interceptions and two fumbles in two playoff games.</p>\n<p>In addition to Manning throwing at least one interception in each of his three previous Super Bowl trips, there has been just one season in which Peyton has threw less than 10 interceptions.</p>\n<p>That lone season ended with a Super Bowl victory over the Chicago Bears with the Indianapolis Colts during the years of 2006-07. Certainly I’m not inferring that the Broncos can’t win because of this statistic, yet the Panthers’ ball hawing defense may be able to prey upon Peyton’s weakest element which could end with Carolina bringing home the Lombardi Trophy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of February 4, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67896\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/battle-of-the-qbs-omaha-meets-the-dab/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67896\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/battle-of-the-qbs-omaha-meets-the-dab/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/battle-of-the-qbs-omaha-meets-the-dab/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/battle-of-the-qbs-omaha-meets-the-dab/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/battle-of-the-qbs-omaha-meets-the-dab/","id":1999,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1998,1997,1996],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UC Student Governments Call for Divestment of Thirty Meter Telescope Project","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-09-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Convocation-by-Christina-DeMarzo-online-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Convocation-by-Christina-DeMarzo-online-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The letter asks the UC to cease funding for TMT and for any faculty or staff working on the project to “speak out against the exploitation of Mauna Kea.” ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Wednesday afternoon, the University of California Student Association, which represents students across all UC campuses, released a letter signed by all nine Associated Students External Vice Presidents demanding the UC cut financial ties with the Thirty Meter Telescope project.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The call for divestment comes two months after students across the UC system </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-07-22/students-condemn-uc-and-chancellor-yangs-involvement-in-thirty-meter-telescope-express-support-for-native-hawaiians/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">began raising their voices</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in opposition to the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT).

Because most universities don’t offer accredited classes taught by professors, students often resort to teaching each other — such as at UC Santa Barbara, where over 650 students are actively learning and teaching each other about blockchain through a club known as Blockchain at UCSB.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89848\" style=\"width: 820px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89848\" data-attachment-id=\"89848\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-21/a-look-inside-ucsbs-blockchain-community/blockchain-new-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/blockchain-new-2.jpg?fit=810%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"810,450\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"blockchain\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/blockchain-new-2.jpg?fit=250%2C139&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/blockchain-new-2.jpg?fit=810%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-89848\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/blockchain-new-2.jpg?resize=810%2C450\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/blockchain-new-2.jpg?w=810&amp;ssl=1 810w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/blockchain-new-2.jpg?resize=250%2C139&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/blockchain-new-2.jpg?resize=768%2C427&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-89848\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The club is focused mainly on “legitimizing” blockchain’s  uses — supply chains, data sharing and property ownership. </span><em>Courtesy of Piergiacomo Palmisani</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the largest organizations on campus, the dynamic of Blockchain at UCSB is similar to most other clubs. Students gather to read papers published in the blockchain field, host invited speakers, attend student-produced lectures and travel to blockchain-related conferences, according to Piergiacomo Palmisani, the club’s incoming president and a graduate student in the Technology Management Program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a lot of people that are interested in learning but are not willing to learn [everything] by themselves. That’s why Blockchain at UCSB exists. We can provide a quality education by teaching [students] all the essentials of this technology,” Palmisani said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a passion for technology is common among all members, reasons for joining the club vary. Some see it as a place where students “can potentially meet their new employers” while others have project ideas and aspirations that could be funded through connections made in the club, Palmisani said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one instance, Palmisani said Blockchain at UCSB connected a project called Reward Stream, designed by third-year computer science major Max Colbert, to investors. Colbert went on to receive $50,000 for the startup after Blockchain at UCSB helped put his project on the map. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The one aspect of blockchain that the club will not support, Palmisani said, is cryptocurrency trading itself. The instant gratification and “quick return” of digital currency is alluring to many, he said, but students in search of investment advice will not find it here.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, the club is focused mainly on “legitimizing” blockchain’s other uses — supply chains, data sharing and property ownership — by drawing more recognition to the industry in hopes of spurring accredited classes down the line, according to Cameron Dennis ‘18, co-founder of Blockchain at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By establishing accredited classes in universities, blockchain may reach those who never knew they had an interest in the technology, Dennis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In doing so, the “talent pipeline” for blockchain professions would have more room to grow, providing employment opportunities at Fortune 500 companies such as Microsoft, IBM and Oracle, which are already investing in the technology, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dennis and Palmisani see the blockchain community as a halfway mark between a club and a classroom, thus bridging the gap between the two.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paramount to Blockchain at UCSB’s achievements is its success in establishing an accredited class dedicated to the technology, Dennis said. This coming fall, the College of Creative Studies will be offering a class about “blockchain development” which students can take for credit — a first at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This class is fulfilling the original mission of what we’re trying to do,” Dennis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will also be receiving support for blockchain-related endeavors through a new initiative launched by a venture capital-backed investment firm called MouseBelt. In August, MouseBelt University, a branch of the firm dedicated to investing in higher education, announced its plans to support UCSB, UC Los Angeles and UC Davis through an “accelerator program,” which entails two planned $500,000 investments for student projects and research funding to be </span><a href=\"https://www.mousebelt.com/blog/mousebelt-university-launches-education-initiative-across-three-uc-campuses/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">split among the three schools</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Ashlie Meredith, university program developer at MouseBelt, UCSB will additionally be receiving a donation to the engineering department and the potential for student project funding in exchange for equity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meredith said UCSB was one of 13 universities that MouseBelt initially worked with on student projects in the past, which made finding a home for the accelerator program easier because the club’s success was already on MouseBelt’s radar. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I engaged in an exploratory effort to talk to as many student organizations as I could in the U.S. and Canada to get the temperature of blockchain at universities, what was going on, who had classes and how established these clubs were,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Blockchain at UCSB] had a lot of partnerships with other organizations, even in Mexico with Blockchain UNAM. They’ve had multiple companies incubate and bring their ideas for potential funding. Even one of our portfolio companies came from one of those investments.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Dennis and Palmisani are both encouraged by MouseBelt’s interest in supporting blockchain-related endeavors at UCSB, and specifically the prospect of student entrepreneurs earning funding, they said there is still work to be done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Palmisani finds that more universities nationwide need to be supportive of an atmosphere where the prospect of educating students about blockchain can become a reality. While investments from venture capital companies are a good sign for UCSB, those opportunities aren’t extended to every school, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What does work, Dennis said, is teaching students in a “grassroots” style. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I go to conferences and I understand what’s happening because I listen to these lectures or presentations. When I’m at a conference, I’ll summarize all the points that seem most important and give a presentation on those points,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By taking home what he learned from conferences, Dennis said he enabled students to keep up with current developments in the professional sphere by teaching them what he learned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, Palmisani said he is looking forward to the upcoming year working with Blockchain at UCSB. Already included on the list of speakers the club will be bringing to campus is Julian Wheatland, former Chief Operating Officer of Cambridge Analytica, which was </span><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/amp-stories/cambridge-analytica-explainer/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">embroiled</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in scandal in early 2018 after millions of users’ information was harvested without consent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With invited speakers, conventions, hackathons and lectures, Palmisani said he embraces the work that needs to be done, despite the heavy load. But it wouldn’t be possible without an affinity for blockchain, his driving force for running the club.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You’ve got to have a lot of passion, otherwise I wouldn’t be doing this. I would just play soccer — my other passion — but I’m not as good as a professional player,” he said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
