Zaidi believes that having the “Miracle Childs” in attendance helps connect participants with the cause and highlight how their fundraising is helping CCMC.</p>\n<p>CCMC hosts numerous fundraising events throughout the year, with GauchoThon being the finale of their year-long efforts and a celebration of the kids and the participants who fundraise.</p>\n<p>Ann Peyrat, liaison with CCMC, explained that the Dance Marathon at UCSB “provides a place for students to ‘belong’” while also benefiting other nonprofits on campus by “giving them a tabling opportunity to spotlight their mission.”</p>\n<p>Peyrat also explained that UCSB students volunteer countless hours for the cause.</p>\n<p>“UCSBDM members ‘table’ on campus, visit classrooms, residence halls, clubs and Greek life and host events. They take on leadership roles, form committees, hold weekly meetings and coordinate everything from catering, sponsorship, marketing, social media, entertainment, performances and visits from now healthy CCMC patients,” she said.</p>\n<p>Over the past five years, UCSBDM and GauchoThon have raised over $60,000 to support Cottage Hospital’s Neo-Natal and Pediatric Intensive Care Units.</p>\n<p>Zaidi said that there is no fundraising goal for this year, “just to raise as much as [they] possibly can.”</p>\n<p>Individual entry for the event requires a $5 donation to CCMC and registration information can be found on the events’ Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Even if students can’t make it out to this year’s event, there are still ways to donate and get involved. Donations will remain open until March and can be submitted on the events’ Facebook page. Registration for next year’s event will open up as early as Fall Quarter.</p>\n<p>“[UCSBDM students] are this generation fighting for the next. We couldn’t be more honored to have the support of Dance Marathon at UCSB,” Peyrat said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

id=\"caption-attachment-82403\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The El Centro Annex has served as a place of organization and community for UCSB’s Latinx community and other campus groups for four decades. The building was deemed unstable in 2017 due to various structural problems, promting students and alumni to call for its repair and the preservation of its history. <em>Kaitlyn Ngyuen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>El Centro, which sits on sunken ground between the library and Broida Hall, has historically been a gathering place for Latinx students and activists. The building provides working space for campus organizations including M.U.J.E.R. de UCSB, El Congreso, Students for Justice in Palestine and the conglomerate Mesa Directiva.</p>\n<p>The reconstruction cost approximately $900,000, funded by Student Affairs and partially funded by the deferred maintenance program.</p>\n<p>In January 2017, occupants of the building received a 45-day vacate notice after a report from the Van Sande Structural Consultant group confirmed various structural issues including insect infestation, poor ventilation and structural damage that made the building highly unstable in the event of an earthquake.</p>\n<p>After the eviction notice, students and alumni voiced their frustration toward the administration for seemingly ignoring the requests of the occupants to repair the building, according to Shahryar Mooraj, a fourth-year mathematical science and physics double major and member of the El Centro Committee.</p>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/\">passed a resolution</a> a few weeks later that supported the restoration of the building and by April 2017 the administration had decided against the demolition of the historic building.</p>\n<p>A committee of students and administrators was then created to discuss the conditions of the new building and to discuss what was needed.</p>\n<p>“As students, we came together to stop that and to fight for the history and the culture that has been built in that space over time and to ensure that El Centro has a permanent physical space on campus,” Mooraj said.</p>\n<p>The space was created as a response to the lack of representation and support from the UCSB administration for the Latinx community, which additionally led to the creation of the Chicana/o Studies department and support programs like EOP, according to Mooraj.</p>\n<p>A 10-day hunger strike by Chicanx student activists in 1994 pushed the UCSB administration to make El Centro a permanent space after the trailer had been given a life-span of 10 years and had not been considered a permanent building.</p>\n<p>“The space of El Centro was allocated in the late ’70s, early ’80s to give students of color a place to congregate, a place to meet where they could feel welcomed on campus during a time when that really wasn’t the case,” Mooraj said.</p>\n<p>“Since then, it’s been a center for community organizing and activism in terms of fighting for different things that students need,” he added.</p>\n<p>According to Mooraj, students at El Centro continually fought for the permanency and improvement of the building, including insect and mold inspections and requests for a hydration station, which was eventually installed late 2016.</p>\n<p>According to UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada, the entire portion of the building that was previously a trailer was remodeled, except for the wood stud walls and plywood siding and the wood roof rafters and plywood roofing.</p>\n<p>The trailer now has a concrete foundation, a drainage system to prevent flooding during the rainy season and new wiring that improves the lights and Wi-Fi connection in the building.</p>\n<p>Mooraj said that some offices were remodeled to create a conference room and a kitchen. Ten feet of space was also added to the main activity room.</p>\n<p>New furniture, monitors and salvaged art pieces from the original building now adorn the reconstructed student hub.</p>\n<p>According to Mooraj, the new building is expected to be a permanent location for El Centro, and there will be regular upkeep and maintenance.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara’s Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and Early Academic Outreach Program are currently operating from the building. A psychologist from Counseling and Psychological Services will also be accessible on the first floor of the building.</p>\n<p>“We have a signed agreement with the Chancellor and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and other administration that El Centro will be a permanent physical space and that it will remain where it is today,” Mooraj said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on

<em>Courtesy of Roberto Young</em></p></div>\n<p>John de Los Angeles, communications director for the American Federation of State, County &amp; Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299, said the union “exhausted” the bargaining process and the public employee relations board, which oversees labor disputes, declared the situation is “at a final impasse.”</p>\n<p>AFSCME’s 9,000 UC Service workers and 15,000 Patient Care Technical workers plan to strike from May 7 to May 9, according to a press release sent out Thursday morning.</p>\n<p>“It just doesn’t appear that we’re going to be reaching an agreement any time soon,” de Los Angeles said. “Strike is a measure of last resort.”</p>\n<p>AFSCME’s first local chapter within the UC system was created at UC Berkeley in 1948. Today, the union represents approximately 24,000 UC workers, according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>The bargaining team, an elected body chosen to represent the workers, has the sole authority to call for a strike. The union’s bargaining team has met with the UC labor relations team nearly once every month for a year, according to de Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>According to a press release from the union, 97 percent of workers within the union voted to “authorize a system-wide strike” in mid-April.</p>\n<p>The release also asked speakers invited to UC graduation events to support union workers by “boycotting university engagements until the labor dispute is solved.”</p>\n<p>AFSCME conducted the voting over two days at locations across the UC’s 10 campuses, five medical centers and research laboratories among others, according to de Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>A small group of UC Santa Barbara students held a protest in front of De La Guerra dining commons on April 16 in support of the workers. AFSCME and other union workers within the UC have also previously held several protests on the UCSB campus, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/court-case-could-bring-financial-strain-to-public-sector-unions/\">most recently</a> on Feb. 15.</p>\n<p>The protests and subsequent vote to strike come following a <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/39pjpl3gf26b93t/A3299_PioneeringInequality_WhitePaperNEW_Web_lo-res.pdf?dl=0\">report</a> analyzing demographics of workers across the UC campuses written and released by AFSCME in early April.</p>\n<p>The report stated non-white employees, specifically those in African-American and Latinx communities, are “often hired into lower-paying titles,” while white people are “hired into higher-paying titles.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the report stated male workers were given a higher average hourly starting pay rate than female workers.</p>\n<p>The average hourly starting pay rate for a white male patient care worker was $32.53 while for the same job, an African-American female was giving an average starting hourly pay of $24.97, according to the report.</p>\n<p>The report also stated UC’s African-American workforce has shrunk by 37 percent since 1996.</p>\n<p>“A Black female patient care worker would need to work for 14 years to reach the starting pay of a white man,” the report states. “A Latina patient care worker would reach the starting wage of a white man after working for 13 years, and a Latina service worker would catch up to a white man’s starting wage after four years.”</p>\n<p>The report took data from UC employment records, according to de Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>“They’re all coming in [for] starting positions, and women of color are just being paid less,” he said.</p>\n<p>The UC has not yet released a public statement in response to the vote or the report, but de Los Angeles said the UC placed conditions in its union contracts “which is why our workers are so upset today.”</p>\n<p>Those conditions include raising the retirement age, raising healthcare rates and holding wages constant.</p>\n<p>“We strongly disagreed with AFSCME’s decision to strike, which will negatively impact patients, students and the UC community,” said Claire Doan, UCOP director of media relations, in an email. “What the union demanded was a 6 percent annual wage increase, which we think is unfair to other UC employees – both represented and non-represented. This is twice what other UC employees have received.”</p>\n<p>Doan said that UCOP has decided to increase AFSCME employees’ wages by two percent for the upcoming fiscal year.</p>\n<p>“UC presented AFSCME leaders with what we believe to be a competitive final settlement proposal that included multi-year wage increases (3 percent annual for four years) along with excellent health and retirement benefits,” she said. “They chose to reject it without conducting vote among their members.”</p>\n<p>The workers’ healthcare premiums will be “brought in line” with the rest of UC’s represented and non-represented employees and the retirement benefits of current employees will remain unchanged while new workers will be offered a choice between a tradition pension or a 401(k)-style plan, according to Doan.</p>\n<p>The raises were stalled for more than a year due to “protracted negotiations,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 26 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Update: This article was updated to include information about the union’s upcoming strike. </i></p>\n<p><em>Update: This article was updated to include a statement from the UC labor relations team. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Hernandez, with Campus United, and Vanessa Maldonado, with the Isla Vista Party. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Anthony Hernandez, with Campus United, and Vanessa Maldonado, with the Isla Vista Party, are the two candidates running for the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their opening remarks, Maldonado spoke about wanting to integrate the Student Apartment Council in A.S. and wanting to expand resources like CalFresh and Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) for students in university-owned off-campus apartments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez’s focus was about offering students a direct voice in senate and holding office hours at various university-owned off-campus apartments so students living there do not feel separated. </span></p>\n<p><b>FIRST PRIORITY:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado wants to focus on mental health services and work with the Santa Catalina residence hall to open up their C.A.P.S. center to students in university-owned off-campus housing. She would also like to implement free yoga programs like ones that currently exist in the freshman dorms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez wants to focus on revamping the orientation program for transfer students, since most students living in university-owned off-campus housing are transfer students. He said he is currently working with the Transfer Student Alliance on this issue and is interested in addressing the issue to make more students feel welcome at UC Santa Barbara when they first arrive. </span></p>\n<p><b>UNI-OWNED APARTMENTS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez plans to hold office hours within the various university-owned off-campus buildings in order to make himself and his position more available to students, as opposed to them having to come on campus to voice their concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado would work with the Student Apartment Council to fully integrate it with A.S., and she would also like to work with the transfer senator that is elected to meet the needs of students in university-owned off-campus housing.</span></p>\n<p><b>QUALIFICATIONS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado, as a current on-campus senator, explained she already has an understanding of the inner workings of A.S. and has experience listening to students’ concerns during public forum. She also believes that her strides to educate herself about issues regarding women of color make her better qualified to work as a senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez was the first diversity director for the Transfer Student Alliance and helped the organization work toward becoming an official A.S. entity. He also kickstarted the first transfer student graduation event, which is occurring later this year. </span></p>\n<p><b>STUDENTS’ NUMBER ONE PROBLEM:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez is interested in making students more active in their community, and he believes the best way to do so is by making resources available to students near their housing and not just on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado also wants to increase accessibility to resources provided by A.S. to students in university-owned off-campus apartments. In addition, she wants to increase awareness of C.A.P.S. and CalFresh. </span></p>\n<p><b>FAMILIES AND FACULTY OFF-CAMPUS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado, in order to reach out to these communities, would canvass or send out polls in order for people to voice their concerns and tell her what they need from her. She’s also interested in forming a council or committee for these communities to be represented in A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez wants to open up dialogue to these communities, as he explained that he does not live there and would not immediately know how to address their concerns, but is interested in finding out and working with theExternal Vice President for Statewide Affairs’ (EVPSA) office to get more funding for families and faculty in off-campus housing. </span></p>\n<p><b>UNIVERSITY APARTMENTS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez is interested in implementing more social activities for students in university-owned off-campus housing. He also wants to have more organizations come to them so that students in those buildings are aware of organizations on campus that represent them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado wants to continue to attend the meetings that students in university-owned off-campus housing hold and increase mental health resources available to them. </span></p>\n<p><b>PARKING:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado wants to offer the University Apartment Council the opportunity to directly voice their concerns to A.S. by integrating the council into A.S. She would also want to work with them to see if they already have ideas to solve the issue and just need help implementing them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez wants to open up this issue to the students and hear about ideas that they might have to address the issue and work to execute them as well as work with the EVPSA and External Vice President for Local Affairs’ office to get funding for the initiative. </span></p>\n<p><b>NEW IDEAS COMPARED TO LAST YEAR:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez wants to ensure students’ voices are heard and serve as a liaison between students and A.S. to meet their needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado feels the current university-owned off-campus senator has a good working relationship with the Transfer Senator and would like to carry on this relationship because  of the overlapping needs in both communities. She would also like to work closely with the Student Apartment Council, as the current university-owned off-campus senator does. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voting for the A.S. election began Monday, April 23, and closes Thursday, April 26.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
