I’ll hit you harder the second time, so you better stay away.”</p>\n<p>She then talked about why she chose UCSB and how she felt stepping on the beachside campus for the first time.</p>\n<p>“I know it’s going to sound really corny, but I came to the campus and just had a feeling. I fell in love,” she said. “I didn’t have to look anywhere else.”</p>\n<p>Five minutes later, she told me about the shoulder injury that almost ended her athletic career and the father she reunited with for the first and last time on his deathbed 3,000 miles away in Boston, 17 years after he abandoned his family.</p>\n<p>“It all happened at the same time,” she said. “The injury, [my dad] coming back… all at the same time.”</p>\n<p>Makenna’s father, Kevin McKenzie, a Jamaican musician who sold hospital beds by day, left the family in 1992 — before Makenna was born — to pursue a music career in Miami.</p>\n<p>“I think when you’re dealing with artistic people, they need to be able to do that sort of thing,” said Makenna’s mother, Pamela. “We had a discussion about it, and I didn’t think he’d actually do it, but he did. His intent was to contact us and to bring us over there, but it never happened.”</p>\n<p>Pamela, who was still pregnant when McKenzie left, immediately realized the urgency of the situation. She enrolled in school shortly after Makenna was born to pursue a nursing career, graduating with an associate’s degree five years later.</p>\n<p>“The bottom line: It doesn’t matter,” Pamela said. “[I told the girls] that the thing about your dad is that we’re grateful that he was there to create you, but he’s not the center of [their] universe. There’s no time to pity. You just need to do the next thing.”</p>\n<p>For Makenna, the next thing was sports. Before moving across the country, her father played cricket in Jamaica and in local leagues throughout Fountain Valley, CA. Her older sister, Keisha, played basketball  in college. Even Makenna’s aunt, Pamela’s younger sister, earned a softball scholarship at Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>“[Sports] do kind of go way back in [Makenna’s] family,” Pamela said. “Back in my mom’s day they wore skirts and played half court ball because full court was too much work for a woman.”</p>\n<p>By the age of 15, Makenna was one of the best goalkeepers in the country, earning a spot on the Under-15 U.S. Girls’ National Team. She began gaining attention from the nation’s top collegiate programs.</p>\n<p>“She was a big-time recruit, period,” Head Women’s Soccer Coach Paul Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>“I loved how professional everything was,” Makenna said of the national team. “For the first time, I saw how things really were when you get to that level. Everything you do is for your team. Everything.”</p>\n<p>When she injured herself, the top collegiate programs began shifting their attention elsewhere. Although Makenna talked about how the experience helped her develop as a Division 1 soccer player, she also lost her spot on the national team, according to Pamela. A month later, she received a letter from her father’s side of the family in Boston, which claimed that her father had  cancer and that she should visit.</p>\n<p>Makenna looks at each transformative stage of her life as a stepping stone in building herself as an athlete and a person, as “hurdles I needed to jump.” According to Stumpf, she has room to grow as a player, but the team is comfortable with her abilities.</p>\n<p>“She’s a kid who has had different experiences, but she’s not bitter about the world,” Stumpf said. “She’s one of the most mature, confident kids I ever met.”</p>\n<p>After college, Makenna hopes to become either a sports psychologist or a coach. She takes the field again at Harder Stadium against Cal State Northridge on Oct. 8. at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26676\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-05/freshman-feature-goalie-high-hopes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26676\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-05/freshman-feature-goalie-high-hopes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-05/freshman-feature-goalie-high-hopes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-05/freshman-feature-goalie-high-hopes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-05/freshman-feature-goalie-high-hopes/","id":207,"author":{"id":90,"name":"Ravi Bhatia"},"related":[206,205,204],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":90,"name":"Ravi Bhatia","biography":"Not available","articles":[114,207,291,610,826,827,829,830,831,832,835,850,859,860,864,866,872,873,875,876,878,888,893,897,903,906,909,910,911,912,916,918,923,1711,1718,1721,1734,1735,1737,1738,1754,2037,2133,2156,2300,2889,2891,3141,3170,4553,4555,4556,5531,5549],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Reeling Gauchos Host Aztecs In Hopes of Earning First Home Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-12-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web-e1580359314548.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web-e1580359314548.jpg?resize=900%2C596&ssl=1","description":"Losers of nine straight, the UCSB women's basketball team will look to pick up their second win of the season hosting San Diego State on Friday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_80012\" style=\"width: 485px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"559859990\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80294\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80012\" data-attachment-id=\"80012\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/amidst-7-game-slide-gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-vs-lmu/danae-miller-moves-the-ball-up-the-court-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WomensBasketball_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-30-17_4-web-e1580359314548.jpg?fit=900%2C596&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"900,596\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Danae Miller moves the ball up the court.

SDSU will visit the Thunderdome Friday looking to bounce back from a loss of its own, as the Aztecs fell to Santa Clara last week.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Aztecs are above .500 thus far, holding a record of 6-4 after opening the season with a three-game win streak. In comparison to the youthful Santa Barbara lineup, the SDSU starters are predominantly seniors, with guard McKynzie Fort leading the charge for the Aztecs.</p>\n<p>Fort is a 5’9 guard and has led her team in scoring in 7 of SDSU’s games this season, averaging team high numbers in points as well as rebounding. In addition to her 16.4 points per game, Fort averages 5.4 boards per contest.</p>\n<p>While the Aztecs will certainly rely on production from their seniors, Santa Barbara will look to build off the performance against LMU Monday.</p>\n<p>Disregarding the final score, the Gauchos outscored the Lions in the second half and found success feeding the ball to Drew Edelman, who finished with 21 points and 8 boards on an efficient 9-13 shooting.</p>\n<p>When Edelman is having those types of games, it seems the Gauchos have an easier time on offense; however, Edelman’s success in the paint may simply be the result of Santa Barbara running its offense the way head coach Bonnie Henrickson desires.</p>\n<p>Henrickson has repeatedly stressed the need to swing the ball and find the open player, whether that equates to an open three or a feed inside.</p>\n<p>With two true freshman point guards in Danae Miller and Sarah Bates, Henrickson’s offense has taken time to be carried-out correctly, but UCSB is continuing to show glimpses of efficient ball movement.</p>\n<p>The only other player on the Santa Barbara roster averaging double-digit scoring is redshirt junior Sarah Porter. Porter is averaging 10.4 points a game despite shooting just 35 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>With almost every Gaucho on the UCSB roster playing at least 10 minutes per contest, each game brings the opportunity for players to give their team that necessary spark either off the bench or from the opening buzzer.</p>\n<p>Facing SDSU will be a good opportunity for the Gauchos to keep translating what they’ve been improving upon in practice to real-game scenarios against a more appropriate opponent than a top-ten team like UCLA.</p>\n<p>Showing progressive improvement, Santa Barbara has worked to cut down its turnover numbers, which have plagued the Gauchos much of this season.</p>\n<p>Averaging 16.7 turnovers per game, the Gauchos limited themselves to losing the ball only 11 times against LMU, their lowest number since the regular season opening win at Northern Arizona.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, UCSB showed more intensity on the defensive end facing LMU, recording 8 steals and forcing 19 turnovers. If Santa Barbara is able to build off of these improvements, the Gauchos may also solve their issue of slow starts.</p>\n<p>In their past three matchups, the Gauchos have failed to score more than 11 points in each first quarter, so Henrickson’s team will likely aim to get off to a better start against SDSU on Friday.</p>\n<p>Last year, the Aztecs hosted Santa Barbara and won by a margin of 14, so Friday’s matchup will also offer the Gauchos a chance at redemption.</p>\n<p>The action between UCSB and SDSU will tip off at 7:00 pm on Friday, December 22 at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Jumping out to an early lead, redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter and freshman guard Denae Miller each scored a basket from downtown.</p>\n<p>Junior combo guard/forward Cheyanne Wallace scored a strong 5 points in the first for the home team.</p>\n<p>After the initial five-point blast, UCSB’s scoring began to falter, being held to just six points for the remainder of the period.</p>\n<p>The quarter then began to get away from the visitors, when the Lions ended the quarter on a 5-0 run, ending the period with a 16-11 lead.</p>\n<p>Trailing by five for the majority of the second quarter, the LMU started to forcefully pull away. With no three-point efforts in the first period, the Lions ignited in the second going 4-for-4 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>One triple was scored by junior guard Andee Velasco, with the other three being secured by senior guard Makenzie Cast.</p>\n<p>With the home team pulling away, Porter hit a three-pointer just before the half ended, bringing UCSB’s deficit to a more manageable 34-26, going into halftime.</p>\n<p>Going bucket-for-bucket with the Lions in the third period, prevented the visitors from gaining any headway against their opponents.</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman for UCSB and Cheyanne Wallace for the home-team, were each heavily engaged in the third.</p>\n<p>Edelman had another stellar double-digit performance, notching eight of her game-high 21 points in the third quarter. While Wallace contributed nine of her team-high 16 points in the third period for LMU.</p>\n<p>The fourth quarter got interesting, as Santa Barbara began to close the gap, bringing the score within four.</p>\n<p>However, after the visiting team’s spark in the fourth, things suddenly changed with just under four minutes to play.</p>\n<p>The score was 62-58 with 3:58 left in regulation, when both teams began to fall short. Both UCSB and the Lions went a combined 0-for-10 from the field for the remainder of the period.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s defense was lacking, allowing Loyola Marymount to outscore them in 3 of the 4 quarters. However, they had a big fourth period, scoring 17 points over the Lions’ 14.</p>\n<p>UCSB shot 36 percent from the field on 23-for-64 shooting, which lacked in comparison to LMU who shot 43 percent on 21-for-49 shooting.</p>\n<p>Edelman’s game-high 21 points gave Santa Barbara a much-needed offensive spike, along with Porter’s 17 points which consisted of four downtown baskets.</p>\n<p>The Lions had an astonishing four players who scored double digits; Makenzie Cast and redshirt junior Bree Alford gave the team 11, Andee Velasco drained 15, and Cheyanne Wallace had a dominant double-double, recording 16 points and 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>The home team conquered the battle of the boards, out rebounding the Gauchos 43-31.</p>\n<p>Beyond the arc was another defeat for UCSB, as they shot a total of 33 three-pointers, and only capitalized on eight of them, ending the night on 24.2 percent three-point shooting. Whereas LMU was more selective about their three-point shots, going for 12, and scoring on 5 of them – to complete 41 percent three-point shooting on the night.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will have another shot to end their losing skid, as they welcome the Aztecs at home this week.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face San Diego State (6-4) on Friday, December 22<sup>nd</sup> at the Thunderdome at 7pm.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80295\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-19/ucsb-drops-9th-straight-match-loses-67-61-at-lmu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80295\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-19/ucsb-drops-9th-straight-match-loses-67-61-at-lmu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-19/ucsb-drops-9th-straight-match-loses-67-61-at-lmu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-19/ucsb-drops-9th-straight-match-loses-67-61-at-lmu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-19/ucsb-drops-9th-straight-match-loses-67-61-at-lmu/","id":204,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[203,202,201],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Gets Back On Track With Victory Over San Diego Christian","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-12-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite its loss to USC, the UCSB men's basketball team overcame the defeat with a win over San Diego Christian.

With the Gauchos only two days removed from a tough, streak-snapping loss to a high-profile USC team, Tuesday’s game was a serious test of UCSB’s mental ability to bounce back from defeat.</p>\n<p>Within the first ten minutes, it was clear that the Gauchos were bound to pass with flying colors. UCSB jumped out to a 30-12 lead by the 10:00 mark of the first half, and coasted to an 87-69 win.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Despite playing only 21 minutes, sophomore guard Max Heidegger led all Gaucho scorers with 19 points on 8-for-12 shooting, and knocked down a team-high three three’s. Forwards Jalen Canty (12 points and six rebounds) and Leland King II (11 points and seven rebounds) broke the Hawks down from the inside in similarly limited minutes.</p>\n<p>For about four minutes, it seemed as though UCSB had fallen into the trap of overlooking San Diego Christian. The Hawks stayed level with the Gauchos, even taking a 10-8 lead on a pair of Derek Novsek free throws.</p>\n<p>Two more Novsek free throws got the Hawks to 12 points, but those free throws came four minutes later, at the 12:13 mark. In the interim, UCSB had jetted off on an 18-0 run to claim a lead they would never relinquish.</p>\n<p>Heidegger’s 19 first-half points were key to UCSB’s performance in the first twenty minutes, as the sophomore was twelve points ahead of any other scorer on the floor in the half. Senior guard Gabe Vincent was a strong second option with eight points and three assists in his 13 minutes of first-half action.</p>\n<p>The margin stayed about the same from that point until halftime, which the Gauchos went into holding a 50-33 lead. Immediately upon returning from the intermission, however, UCSB broke the game well and truly open.</p>\n<p>Playing with primarily second-unit players, the Gauchos extended their lead to 77-44 by about the ten-minute mark. Forward Ami Lakoju was particularly instrumental in UCSB’s second-half dominance, as the junior chipped in 12 points, tied for his career-high, and five rebounds in just 14 minutes of action.</p>\n<p>Freshman guard Brandon Davis saw an extra-heavy dose of playing time thanks to the blowout as well as a night off for point guard Marcus Jackson, and Davis responded with a career-high nine points on 4-for-6 shooting.</p>\n<p>A 33-point lead with less than ten minutes to go is more or less an unbridgeable chasm of a lead, but the Hawks did their absolute best to string that bridge together. San Diego Christian closed the game on a 23-6 run to bring the deficit back under 20, but was ultimately unable to truly threaten UCSB’s cushion.</p>\n<p>San Diego’s Novsek and Frederick Hayden led all scorers with 21 and 22 points, respectively. Both players scored ten points in the second half alone, providing the dual scoring threats the Hawks needed to claw back within 20 points of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UCSB travels north to take on Sacramento State on Saturday in Sacramento at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80336\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/ucsb-gets-back-on-track-with-victory-over-san-diego-christian/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80336\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/ucsb-gets-back-on-track-with-victory-over-san-diego-christian/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/ucsb-gets-back-on-track-with-victory-over-san-diego-christian/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/ucsb-gets-back-on-track-with-victory-over-san-diego-christian/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/ucsb-gets-back-on-track-with-victory-over-san-diego-christian/","id":205,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[204,203,202],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
