Students have the option of replacing one of the upper-division art history courses with a portfolio workshop course and a two-unit internship course, according to the minor sheet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The art history and architecture department already provides three academic options for students looking to pursue art-related endeavors: the core major, the core minor and a minor in museum studies, which was first offered to students in Fall Quarter 2018, according to Savannah Parison, the program advisor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The architecture and urban history minor will allow students with an interest in architecture to pursue an education in the field without having to fully dedicate themselves to the discipline, according to Parison.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The project has been in progress for two years with the aim being student enrollment in Fall [Quarter 2019],” Parison said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The curriculum committee, who decided on the content of the new minor, included Professor Swati Chattopadhyay, Professor Claudia Moser and Department Chair Mark Meadow, all from the Department of History of Art &amp; Architecture. Although the program was just unveiled at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2019, Parison said a couple of students have already come in to declare the minor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She noted that the new minor is not exclusive to art history courses; it includes opportunities to take courses within both the geography and environmental studies majors. Both of the aforementioned disciplines offer classes that can be used to fill requirements of the minor, including the geography department’s series on urban or regional planning and the environmental department’s series on sustainable communities, according to Parison.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She clarified that the minor would not solely focus on the classical world, but the architecture of multiple styles and time periods as well.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parison has already noticed an interest in the minor across a variety of academic fields, including </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (S.T.E.M.)</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">majors that usually wouldn’t express interest in art history given the demands of their coursework.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve had a lot of interest from engineering students in the past who want to be involved but can’t double major in two colleges but can do the minor relatively easy. It gives them a way to participate and we’ve received lots of support from the engineering departments and advisors,” Parison said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parison advises students to meet with her before taking on the minor to determine if it will fulfill their needs and interests, or even if the major may potentially be suited for them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are not a university that explicitly prepares students to be an architect and this minor is not the best way to qualify for architecture school. This is a minimal step and so discussions need to be had,” Parison said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She emphasized that there are opportunities for students interested in a career in architecture, stating students should reach out to faculty member and permanent lecturer Jeremy White who regularly holds workshops on the subject matter. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of

page </span></em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What most students don’t know, however, is that this post didn’t belong to a student at all — it belonged to a professor, seasoned with over a decade’s worth of experience in the art of memeing with enough practice to likely earn himself a degree in it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The professor, Bob Kennedy — a linguistics lecturer at UCSB — first dipped his toes in the university’s meme scene years ago, when he began posting on a now-defunct Facebook group.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think your cohort is not aware of the fact that there was a different UCSB meme page around 2011, 2012 or so. It’s still up, but it’s fallen into disuse and nobody posts on it,” Kennedy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I stopped checking because there was no activity on it. But then I think it was during Thomas Fire, one of my students mentioned to me, ‘Hey, Professor Kennedy, you’ve got to check out the [new] meme page because the memes people are making about the fire are hysterical,’” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to jokes of his own, Kennedy blends in well with the student-generated memes around him, posting pictures of slumped-over trees and punny captions to appease viewers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up until recently, Kennedy says most of his activity on the “Zesty Meme Cuisine for Horny Teens” meme page has been spent “lurking,” or scrolling through the page without posting. But he actively posts on a linguistics meme page he maintains himself, which he said is chock-full of “really niche humor.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Those [linguistics] jokes are lost on just about everybody,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Kennedy said the jokes that don’t work serve to teach him about the ones that do. After teaching at UCSB for over 15 years, Kennedy has had ample time to hone his craft. He’ll opt to inject “a little bit of playful humor” while teaching a class, which oftentimes helps him make a point or lighten the mood. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If I have humor in class, it’s either self-deprecating or it makes fun of people in power.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But memes, on the other hand, serve a different purpose. Kennedy finds that the nature of memes — “a quick joke” — enables people to laugh at “content that everyone can get right away.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it doesn’t need to be explained, then people are gonna respond well,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s not to forget about the downsides of meme culture, such as the potential for a “destructive” or “nasty” message — which Kennedy said is generally the result of cracking a joke intended to be funny but ends up offensive in its delivery. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Another thing that comes up, especially in the teaching context, is where we confront humor that’s hurtful. And so in some of my classes, I do this: I’ll say, ‘Look, here’s the point of view that someone had tried to make with a joke and it’s offensive and their defense is going to be, ‘Well, come on, I’m just trying to be funny,’” Kennedy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s never an appropriate response to defend a joke that’s been hurtful to someone else,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid this, however, Kennedy suggests that anyone looking to crack a joke should bear in mind their own identity as to not “punch down” with their humor, or make a joke that pushes the boundaries on one’s identity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kennedy defines himself as a “straight, white middle-aged person,” which means “the only people I can tell jokes about are people who think they’re smarter than they are, people who are wealthy or people who are older than myself,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He made note of comedy’s magnitude in the academic world, some of which has spilled into classrooms at UCSB with Linguistics 135, a course dedicated to memes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have a colleague in my department who teaches a class on memes and it’s a deep dive into theories of what it is that people are tapping into when they make [memes],” Kennedy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s scholars who study the structure of humor and joke templates and everything else like that. And the nature of how humor plays a role in conversational interactions,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although a linguist by trade, Kennedy said he uses comedy to not only make students laugh, but to also use memes’ shared “overlapping” sense of humor to better understand social practices used among college students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The student perspective] is valuable to me,” which opens doors to a culture that “people my age ought to be more aware of than pretend like we’re annoyed by it or anything else like that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So next time a funny meme floats across your screen — look twice — it may be your professor. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
