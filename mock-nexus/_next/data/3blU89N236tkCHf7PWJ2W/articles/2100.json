Senate and has the power to serve as a tie-breaking vote. The IVP is also responsible for providing the A.S. Senate with various trainings and facilitating the completion of A.S. Senate group projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The forum consisted of Adam answering A.S. Election Board’s questions for about 20 minutes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time, Adam spoke to her qualifications to serve in the executive position, noting that she has been a College of Letters &amp; Science Senator this past year. Adam added that she has attended all but “one or two” A.S. Senate meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam emphasized that her main goal is to implement trainings as soon as senators are sworn into office so they know “what is expected of them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam also plans on having either herself or her first and second pro tempores hold one-on-one meetings with senators every quarter in order to check in on the projects they are working on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam believes the public should play a large role during Senate meetings and referenced a resolution she authored earlier this school year which called for scheduling public forum at the beginning of all Senate meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said she authored the resolution “so members of our community are encouraged to come and speak to their representatives and don’t have to guess what time to come at.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam also mentioned her experience as a senator liaison to Take Back the Night, which is an anti-sexual violence organization, and The Bottom Line. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think I have effectively worked with those groups and really made sure they know what the Senate can do for them,” Adam said. “I’ve helped them update legal code; I publicize their events.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam also believes senators should establish clear goals to meet with their Boards, Commissions, and Units (BCUs) at the beginning of the quarter, and senators should be subject to progress checks throughout the quarter regarding the work they’re doing with their BCUs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When it comes to working with BCUs, whether it’s me or whether it’s my senators… it’s all about working smarter and not harder, so really figuring out exactly what these BCUs need and exactly what the Senate can do for them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam identified the largest internal problem within A.S. as the everyday student not knowing what A.S does. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In my time [in A.S.], [A.S.] has had this recurring problem that we only benefit and we only really interact with those who are already involved with A.S.,” Adams said. “We really need to do a much better job at getting awareness and our resources and our benefits to the students who aren’t already involved with us.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam wants to work with other executive offices to create an A.S. mobile application that would consist of all of the A.S. resources incoming first-year students need. The students could download the app during orientation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of what has prepared Adam to chair Senate meetings, Adam referenced her public speaking skills, adding that she has participated in Mock Trial, debate and musical theater. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have no problem taking command of a room and really asserting control so that Senate is running more efficiently, that members of the public are respected and so that everyone in the room is taking space and making space and being heard when it is allowed.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to how Adam would maintain civility while leading a Senate with members that come from two different political parties, Adam said she plans on being nonpartisan and neutral. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam then went on to discuss how she would conduct trainings differently than how they were conducted this past year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This past year, our trainings didn’t come until the middle of winter quarter, which not only stifled how productive we could be, but it’s also against legal code.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam said she would make training a priority. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam went on to discuss the connections she has developed with UCSB administration, stating that she served on the Faculty Executive Committee and was an intern at the Mosher Alumni House. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam’s first line of action, if elected, would be to create a mission statement for the 70th Senate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want [the mission statement] to be a physical banner that we hang in the Flying A room every Wednesday night, so there is a clear standard and clear purpose [so] that all senators know why we are here… so we start off on the right foot regardless of how elections go.”</span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.

This left Campus United candidate Alli Adam as the sole candidate in the race.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the drop, the Isla Vista Party tried to submit a substitute candidate, Off-Campus Senator Jasmine Palmerin, in lieu of Nagpal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Elections Board denied this request, the Isla Vista Party took the case to Judicial Council, going over the board’s head and filing a petition with the council on April 8. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the petition, Nagpal and Palmerin — represented through legal counsel by former senator Alexandra Gessesse and Letters and Science Senator Ricardo Uribe — argued that the Elections Board has the authority to allow for a switch in candidates after the deadline because Legal Code did “not expressly forbid a switch from taking place.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the Judicial Council agreed with Elections Board decision not to make the switch and deferred to its judgment, finding that “a switch would require steps that do violate Legal Code. “</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opinion added that Nagpal’s argument that his “<span lang=\"EN\">extenuating circumstances warrant an exception to the Legal Code” is not applicable, because Legal Code does not specifically list “extenuating circumstances” as a factor that can be used when determining a candidate’s eligibility. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision also cites Article XVIII §1(A-B) of Legal Code, which states that, “[u]nless otherwise specified in the Legal Code, the Elections Committee will have all jurisdiction in regard to election rules, policies, enforcement, and promotion at all times during the academic year.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision was signed by three judicial council members: Kimi Nasiri, Nayely Marron and Justin Nilsen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> initially attended the Monday hearing; however, Nagpal asked that the hearing be moved to a closed session, citing concerns with those outside of the council and the Election Board hearing about his health issues, and the council complied with his request. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The council’s decision in full can be viewed below: </span></p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Opinion.docx\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Opinion.docx\">here to download it.</a></object></p>\n<p><i>Updated [2:26 p.m.]: This article was updated to clarify that extenuating circumstances is not a factor that can be used when determining candidate’s eligibility. </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

id=\"caption-attachment-87502\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands themselves were primarily written toward the end of Winter Quarter. </span><em>Courtesy of Isabella Liu</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the demands team, the term “Pan Asian” refers to those who are of Southeast Asian, South Asian and Pacific Islander descent, along with those who identify as Asian American, multi-ethnic students, international students from Asia, immigrants, refugees, undocumented students from Asia and first-generation students of Asian descent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands are separated into three main sections: academic programs, campus resources and campus programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The “academic programs” section demands the strengthening of the Asian American studies department and says UCSB must hire five new tenure-track faculty members and two new staff members in the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not like the professors aren’t doing good work, it’s that they are one of the smallest departments on our campus,” Ng said. “They have six tenured faculty members.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ng, a fourth-year biological sciences and global studies double major, said this number is not where the department should be, especially considering that the Asian American studies department in theory should “provide enough academia and knowledge and research” for almost a third of the student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What’s really interesting is that UCSB was the first university in the entire country to offer an Asian American studies B.A., but if you track the progression of when we first offered it to now, the department has only grown by three members.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The “academic programs” section also calls for the creation of an interdisciplinary graduate emphasis in Asian American studies, as well as institutional support and funding for the Asian Pacific Islander Graduate Student Alliance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The “campus resources” section demands that UCSB mandates “in-person interactive workshops in issues specifically pertaining to Pan Asian students to all employed staff” in Student Health Services, Campus Learning Assistance Services (CLAS), Campus Advocacy Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) and the Office of Student Life (OSL), among other entities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s been a really big issue with people not recognizing that Asia represents a continent,” Ng said. “The point of the trainings is for us to get staff up to the knowledge that we would like to see them at, to realize the different needs of different cultural groups.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The “campus resources” section also demands that UCSB create paid positions for “increased Pan Asian representation in CAPS, EOP, Undocumented Student Services and Housing, Dining, and Auxiliary Enterprises.” Additionally, the Pan Asian Network demands that UCSB administration identify which languages are spoken by Pan Asian students and then pay for accurate translations of UCSB materials accordingly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They kind of just assume that all Indian students speak Hindi, and not, like, Tamil,” Ng said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final “campus programs” section calls on UCSB to create a Pan Asian Center that would focus “on providing opportunities to foster inclusivity among all members of the UCSB Pan Asian community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board of the Pan Asian Center would comprise a director, a programming coordinator and a publicity coordinator. The center would also offer paid student staff positions, according to the demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All members of the board would be paid a salary, according to Ng. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Thirty [percent] of our student body has one room on campus that represents their cultural identity where they can meet, socialize and find a central home. There’s no way that room can do all of that,” Ng said, referring to the Asian Resource Center in the Student Resource Building.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ng added that the Pan Asian Center does not necessarily need to be a new, standalone building constructed specifically for this purpose. Ng said a separate building, similar to El Centro, would be ideal, but indicated that the Pan Asian Network is flexible on this issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ng said the Pan Asian Network demands team is made up of eight undergraduate students and that the team formed “very organically.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It ended up being through word of mouth of who was already Asian and in the activist community, which is a pretty small group of people,” Ng added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands themselves started to gain traction during Winter Quarter 2019.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At that time, we weren’t really sure what we should call ourselves. We didn’t want it to be extremely East Asian-centric,” Isabella Liu, another member of the demands team, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Liu, a second-year communication and philosophy double major, the demands team was created after the Asian-Pacific Islander (API) town halls, held by the API Task Force, during Fall and Winter Quarter. The demands themselves were primarily written toward the end of Winter Quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We sent it out to other organizations with members that would fit under the Pan Asian category and had them submit any recommendations and changes that they would like to see, and we tried to include them as best as we could,” Liu said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pan Asian Network also circulated a survey on Facebook to gather input on what students wanted to see in the demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re lucky that our board is very diverse in that we have East Asian, South Asian, Southeast Asian and mixed race [students], so we have a pretty diverse board at least to draw from experience,” Ng said. “It’s really hard to get 30% of the student body to agree on one thing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Ng and Liu hope that Chancellor Yang is receptive to the list of demands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The idea is for as many students as possible to join the Pan Asian Network in delivering the demands to Chancellor Yang’s office,” Ng said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our hope is that, given he is an Asian American, and that he’s existed within this world, that he can also empathize and realize what we’re asking for and why  need it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Liu said there are currently two Associated Students senators working on a resolution in support of the Pan Asian Network demands. The senators plan to introduce the resolution during Wednesday night’s senate meeting.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Liu said she is a student sponsor of the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pan Asian Network demands follow the Black Student Union (BSU) demands released earlier this school year, in which the BSU called for a similar increase in resources for Black students on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We definitely saw the momentum that BSU had, and we were inspired by that,” Liu said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the things we demand just happen to be very similar because they’ve been neglected by the administration for so long. There are definitely parallels, and we see them as well, but I wouldn’t necessarily say that our demands themselves were directly influenced by BSU,” Liu added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands in full can be viewed below: </span></p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/PAN-Demands-2019-1.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/PAN-Demands-2019-1.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article indicated that Rachel Ng suggested using El Centro for the Pan Asian Center; however, the article has been updated to clarify that Ng actually said<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a separate building, similar to El Centro, would be ideal. </span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

id=\"caption-attachment-87602\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Both candidates spoke to their qualifications and experience.<em> Andrea Verdugo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves is running with the Isla Vista Party, while Sway is running with Campus United. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below are the questions they were asked and a summary of their answers: </span></p>\n<p><b>What do you believe is the greatest issue facing new transfer students? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway said transfer students have “a hard time acclimating into UCSB culture” and that he believes the greatest issue transfer students face has to do with registering on G.O.L.D. and keeping up with course load. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves believes the greatest issue facing new transfer students is the transition into the University of California system. Aceves said he hopes to reform the transfer student orientations, as he doesn’t believe the orientations currently highlight all of the resources available to transfer students. </span></p>\n<p><b>UCSB has a 91% transfer retention or graduation rate. That means that 91% of transfers either stay at UCSB or graduate after their first year. This also means that 9% of transfer students end up not attending UCSB anymore after their first year. What plans do you have to increase the transfer retention number so more transfer students end up staying at the university? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway repeated that retention rates have to do with “acclimating into the UCSB culture” and navigating through the course load at UCSB. He added that he hopes to establish a transfer student/alumni mentorship program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves believes that an increased amount of programs at the university-owned apartments and extending events to reach the university-owned apartments would allow the transfer student community to feel more included in the UCSB community, because that is where the transfer community primarily lives. </span></p>\n<p><b>According to the Associated Students (A.S.) Legal Code, the transfer senator must attend all Transfer Student Alliance organization meetings every quarter. Have you ever been to a meeting ran by the Transfer Student Alliance (TSA) or have you ever been to a meeting by a similar transfer-focused organization? If so, can you name one program run by this organization that you believed helped improve the transfer experience at UCSB?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway said he has been attending TSA meetings for the past quarter. He is also on the Transfer Graduation Committee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves said he was an active member of TSA during fall quarter, and that he hosted a pep rally before a UCSB soccer game for the organization. Aceves mentioned that being a part of the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) as a transfer student has helped him access resources and build community, and he believes that EOP can do the same for other transfer students. </span></p>\n<p><b>How will the two-party system of campaigning affect you when you take office? Do you believe you’ll be able to work effectively with the members of the other party or other independents? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway said the two-party system is filled with “a lot of drama,” and that he likes to distance himself from that drama. He added that “everyone here definitely very deeply cares about the UCSB community and their constituents” and he hopes to continue with that sentiment if elected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves believes working with another party will not affect the platform points he is trying to push for. Aceves emphasized he is fighting for the transfer community as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><b>Many transfer senators have said that it has been intimidating coming from a junior college straight into a large university like UCSB, which has tons more people and more challenging upper-division classes. What would you do to change this culture shock and help transfers fit in better during their first quarter here? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway acknowledged the difficulty of jumping into upper-division courses right away as a transfer student and discussed the “negligence of orientation,” adding that the counseling opportunities were limited. Sway hopes to “revamp and reinvent” orientation and Gaucho FYI, a mandatory workshop that UCSB students have to take, to be more “transfer friendly.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves said providing transfer students with a sense of community as soon as they arrive at UCSB will help them acclimate. </span></p>\n<p><b>UCSB offers several on-campus resources that many students don’t even know about, such as the Collaborate Print Labs that offer 200 free prints a quarter. Name any on-campus resource that you believe transfer students, as a whole, could learn about and perhaps take advantage of. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway believes the Transfer Student Center is a resource the transfer student community could take advantage of. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves mentioned the ONDAS Student Center, TSA, Transfer Student Center, EOP and Campus Learning Assistance Services (CLAS) as resources the transfer student community could take advantage of.</span></p>\n<p><b>Being a student can be extremely stressful. Students have to juggle three or more classes with all of their extracurriculars. Do you believe that we should expand mental health resources on campus at C.A.P.S.? If you do, what is your plan?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway said he wants to see Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) expanded, and wants to implement a transfer-specific C.A.P.S program at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves said the TSA created “a small group” that is working with transfer students and C.A.P.S. and he wants to expand on that. He did not specify further.</span></p>\n<p><b>92% of UCSB transfer students come from community colleges. Can you talk about your own transfer experience? What advice would you give to a student who’s about to go into their first year in junior college and wants to eventually transfer to UCSB?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway spoke to his experience coming from a rural community in Northern California, adding that his community college experience was difficult and isolating. His advice is to not stress too much about where you want to transfer and how you are going to do academically— instead, you should focus on “incorporating yourself into your new community and environment.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves said his experience has been amazing, and that he has been welcomed into many inclusive communities who want to help him succeed academically and socially. His biggest piece of advice to prospective students is that asking for help isn’t bad, because there are many people on campus who want to help. </span></p>\n<p><b>What do you think about the class sign-up process on G.O.L.D.? In the past, students have recommended a shopping cart on G.O.L.D. where students can favorite classes that they want to take before their pass time. Do you believe that G.O.L.D. is currently a convenient way to choose your classes or could it be better? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway said that navigating G.O.L.D. as a transfer student is difficult and believes that G.O.L.D. should be “reorganized to be more streamlined and better oriented for new users.” He believes  the waitlist process should be reformed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves also said navigating G.O.L.D. is challenging, and he believes Gaucho Transfer Fridays and transfer orientations could be reformed to further help transfer students navigate G.O.L.D. He added that workshops could also be implemented. </span></p>\n<p><b>Many transfer students say that they have trouble finding advisors to help guide them through the first quarter at college. Do you believe that increased advising services would improve the transfer experience? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway believes that “incorporating counseling services into Gaucho FYI” as well as re-organizing orientation to highlight counseling resources. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves believes in expanding advising, but he emphasized that in order to address the needs of the transfer community, advising cannot only be available on campus. He mentioned working with Resident Assistants to allow advisors to promote services to transfer students. </span></p>\n<p><b>3,000 visitors come to UCSB’s Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity each year. How do you plan to advocate for and uplift the voices of LGBTQ students? What will you do to contribute to making UCSB a space where LGBTQ students feel safe in their communities?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway said that while he is not a part of the “LGBQT community,” he is “more than willing and able to listen to any of their concerns” and “would love to advocate for them on their behalf.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves believes in being an ally to the LGBTQ community and in “allowing for spaces that are inclusive to everyone no matter how you choose to identify.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Given that UCSB is ranked as the No. 5 public school and the biggest thing in our way from achieving a higher ranking is our “party school reputation,” how do you plan on curtailing our party school reputation and have us better recognized as a school focused on academics for prospective students in California and for out-of-state/international/transfer students?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway said one of the most enjoyable things for him has been “the amount of options every given day on what to do… not only is the school [recognized] as a party school, but we are ranked now [in the] top five in public universities and I believe that’s a great thing, because not only are the people able to party hard, but they’re also able to play hard too.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves said “a way to move away from this whole ‘UCSB is a party school’” is by “exposing ourselves to environments that are…challenging us academically, like attending conferences… I think that’s a big one, just being there and showing that our university is pushing and we are academically competitive and we’re pushing for new breakthroughs.”</span></p>\n<p><b>What would your first line of action be if you are elected? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sway hopes to advocate for community composting at UCSB by working with the Isla Vista Compost Collective, A.S. Recycling and existing community gardens.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aceves, once again, emphasized that he wants to reform transfer orientations to highlight resources for transfer students.</span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.
