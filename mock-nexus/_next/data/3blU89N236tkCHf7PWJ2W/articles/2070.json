Abdullahi said she would like to give financial aid to working students who live in university-owned off-campus housing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to try to see if I can work something out to get students who work above a certain amount of hours to get financial assistance,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abdullahi is also a proponent of strengthening the current bus services, as she finds that both freshmen living in the Santa Catalina Residence Halls and other students living in university-owned off-campus housing often have to “put in a little more effort to come to school on time.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s a huge inconvenience even when you live a mile away from campus,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abdullahi is also in favor of working with transfer senators, as she claims their constituents often overlap because many transfer students seek residence through university-owned off-campus housing as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve already been working with the current transfer senator that’s running… to do my job effectively, I will also have to be in close contact with people who are also representing the same groups of people that I’m representing,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abdullahi said the biggest issue with university-owned off-campus housing is the distance from campus, stating that the extended time it takes to campus is an inconvenience to students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parking problems, an issue not necessarily specific to university-owned off-campus housing, was also a point of conversation during the forum. Abdullahi said she believes residents who live the farthest from campus should receive parking priority.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To tackle rising student fees, Abdullahi suggested “looking into the system to see where money is allocated” in order to reallocate funds to help combat the price hike. However, Abdullahi admitted that she is unfamiliar with the system but plans to become more familiar with it in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the topic of accessibility, specifically between the student body and A.S., Abdullahi would like to bridge the gap by personally approaching students to understand their needs. Furthermore, she would like to augment the current level of representation of university-owned off-campus housing students by moving events that would typically occur on campus to off campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing what students need and asking them personally is something that I intend to do,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abdullahi added that she would have no problem holding meetings with students living in university-owned off-campus housing to help inform them of A.S. resources. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When discussing her background, Abdullahi noted that being a woman of color and a first generation student has allowed her to “walk through campus with a few different lenses,” which she believes will ultimately motivate her to be more “sympathetic” to the needs of students. As a Resident Assistant, Abdullahi said her immersion in different student communities has also helped broaden her horizons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once you help everybody at the bottom, everybody else gets helped out as a result,” she said. </span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>. Voting on G.O.L.D. opens on April 22 at 8 a.m. and will conclude on April 25 at 4 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

While the cupboard is not completely empty, it might be a couple years before the Lakers are back atop the NBA and ready to compete for a championship. Despite the uncertainties facing the team, the Lakers have always shown an ability and willingness to make drastic moves to improve overnight.</p>\n<p>Before making any serious roster decisions, the owners and general manager Mitch Kupchak need to hire the right coach for the team. Thankfully, Mike D’Antoni will not be returning next season. Several people have been rumored as potential fits for the Lakers, including Kurt Rambis, Byron Scott, Mike Dunleavy, Lionel Hollins and Alvin Gentry, among others. Personally, among the names listed, Scott or Hollins make the most sense to me, but that decision will be up to the front office to figure out.</p>\n<p>In terms of the Lakers’ player personnel, it all starts with Kobe Bryant. The future Hall-of-Famer will enter his 18th season with serious questions regarding his ability to play at the same elite level after missing most of last season with injuries to his knee and Achilles. The Lakers made an enormous gesture toward Kobe in awarding him the largest salary in the league, but this big number limits the team in many ways.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Only three players have guaranteed contracts for next season, including Kobe, Steve Nash and Robert Sacre. Nash is the oldest player in the league and missed most of last season with nerve and back injuries. He is a shell of his former self, but may still prove to be an effective distributor if he can stay on the court. Kendall Marshall’s non-guaranteed contract of under $1 million is a good bargain for a player that is still young and possesses a lot of potential.</p>\n<p>Despite Nash and Marshall’s probable inclusion on the roster, point guard will be a major area of emphasis for the Lakers this offseason. The Lakers hold the No. 7 pick in this year’s draft. While top point guard prospect Dante Exum will likely be off the board by then, the Lakers could opt to select Oklahoma State’s Marcus Smart if he is still available. Smart would give the Lakers an aggressive and talented athlete, albeit it one with some past character concerns to speak of. Possible free agent fits include Eric Bledsoe and Darren Collison, although the Phoenix Suns are likely to match any offer made to Bledsoe.</p>\n<p>With Pau Gasol unlikely to return, as he might command too large of a contract in free agency for the Lakers to re-sign him, the team is in need of a talented big man. Some names that could be available to the Lakers in this year’s draft include Kentucky’s Julius Randle, Indiana’s Noah Vonleh or Arizona’s Aaron Gordon. Each would add a presence down low for the Lakers and ooze with potential, although in different aspects of the game.</p>\n<p>There is a limited pool of free agent players this year and the Lakers do not seem like a great fit for the top player on the board, Carmelo Anthony. Los Angeles may be best suited to re-sign the likes of Nick Young and Jodie Meeks, add one or two B-list players and wait until the loaded free agent pool of next season.</p>\n<p>It seems unlikely the Lakers will acquire Kevin Love through a trade, as they do not have the resources others can offer to the Timberwolves. The Lakers can try to add Love, LaMarcus Aldridge or Rajon Rondo next offseason in an attempt to reload and ascend to the top of the NBA.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of May 28th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Minchen Shen of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55646\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/from-norcal-to-socal-returning-to-playoff-caliber-teams/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55646\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/from-norcal-to-socal-returning-to-playoff-caliber-teams/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/from-norcal-to-socal-returning-to-playoff-caliber-teams/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/from-norcal-to-socal-returning-to-playoff-caliber-teams/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/from-norcal-to-socal-returning-to-playoff-caliber-teams/","id":2069,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[2068,2067,2066],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Former Officer Sues UCPD, Alleges Racism, Misconduct and Conspiracy Throughout Department","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pizza-with-a-cop_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pizza-with-a-cop_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This marks the third lawsuit filed by an officer against the UCPD during the 2018-2019 school year.

Signa filed his own lawsuit against former UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson in November 2018. <em>Nexus file photo </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit makes several allegations against current and former members of UCPD, including former Chief of Police Dustin Olson, former Assistant Chief of Police Cathy Farley, Lieutenant David Millard, Lieutenant Mark Signa, Lieutenant Robert Romero, Officer Tiffany Little, Officer Michael Little and Officer Ryan Hashimoto.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges Smith was consistently retaliated against by UCPD staff for bringing attention to concerning practices and behaviors within the department. Some of Smith’s concerns included alleged police mockery of Chancellor Henry T. Yang, of fellow officers and of sexual assault and rape victims, as well as falsifying sexual assault reports and racial discrimination. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit is the most recent of the three to be filed. It alleges that Lieutenant Signa, the plaintiff in the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mark Signa v. UC Regents </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">case against UCPD filed in November 2018, consistently retaliated against Smith. Smith allegedly brought repeated grievances about Lieutenant Signa and other officers’ behavior to former Chief Olson, but court documents state Smith “has continued to be the target of harassment and retaliation” – even after resigning from the department in November 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mark Signa v. UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, court documents allege that Smith participated in a “Good Ole Boys’ Club” within the department, which allegedly fostered and condoned misconduct, favoritism, harassment and retaliation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final of the three suits filed against UCPD since November is from Officers Tiffany and Michael Little, spouses working within the department. According to court documents, in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Little v. UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the pair alleged that they were retaliated against after reporting Smith for allegedly having an extramarital affair with a subordinate officer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All three cases referenced specific events in which the officers were both involved but alleged different circumstances and details on what exactly happened. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the most recent case filed, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe v. UCPD</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Smith alleges that Officer Signa, Officers Tiffany and Michael Little and Officer Hashimoto “engaged in relentless acts of defamation of character and false light” and “have created and promoted a narrative within the UCPD and surrounding law enforcement agencies” about Smith’s resignation and integrity as an officer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case also alleges that Lieutenant Signa, the Littles and other officers “conspired” against Smith by making a personnel complaint against him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith resigned near the end of 2017 due to alleged “ongoing harassment and retaliation” and UCSB’s “inaction” in response to the conduct, court documents state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allegations in Smith’s case against UCPD date back to 2014, shortly after Smith was hired in the department, according to court documents. Below are the specific allegations the case makes against individual UCPD officers and the department as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><b>Lieutenant Mark Signa </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Court documents allege that since the start of Smith’s employment in August 2012, a group of officers have “consistently failed to leave the station for nearly entire shifts and spent most nights at the station playing video games, watching movies, and/or browsing the internet.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lieutenant Signa allegedly participated in these activities and showed “inappropriate ‘Youtube’ videos to the squad.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As sergeant, Smith allegedly “gave clear directives that officers were to stay out of the station, not to watch TV or movies or play video games on duty,” court documents state. In response, Lieutenant Signa allegedly “scoffed” at Smith’s directives and posted “multiple colored photocopies of [World War II-era] General Patton throughout [the] station” with Smith’s name on them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith also allegedly requested multiple trainings in the time span between 2015 and 2017, but “Signa denied all of these requests, while consistently allowing other sergeants to attend courses,” court documents allege. When Smith asked about this, Lieutenant Signa allegedly said Smith was “developed enough” and that the “Department did not need to spend any money” on Smith. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around April 2015, amid “scrutiny regarding the handling of sexual assault cases,” the department allegedly took reports in which “males were being listed as rape and sexual assault suspects, despite no evidence of a crime occurring,” according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The department also allegedly took reports “where victim’s statements were being exaggerated to meet elements of a crime.” Signa allegedly ordered that officers continue “classifying all males as suspects in any sex-related case, whether or not a crime had occurred.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly expressed concern that this practice was “libelous” and did not adhere to “standard and appropriate law enforcement procedures, and potentially violated due process.” Signa allegedly “became upset” with Smith and told him to “let the district attorney figure out who is guilty and who is not.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa also allegedly said “UCPD could not afford the political scrutiny.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD members also allegedly created a “secret log” for sexual or domestic violence cases, which all officers in the department had access to. Officers were allegedly “not to disclose knowledge of this log within their reports to avoid discovery.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly reported concerns of the secret log to Olson and Farley. Olson allegedly said he would “look into” the concerns. Court documents say this secret log still exists within the UCPD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the end of 2016, Signa allegedly ordered Smith to continue training “an African American officer, despite the fact that the Officer was not meeting the training standards.” Signa allegedly said “it was a politically sensitive matter because the officer was black,” citing Olson’s desire for greater diversity in the department. Smith allegedly reported Signa’s statements to UCPD staff, but no action was taken. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In February 2017, Smith was allegedly assigned to a “mutual aid response” at UC Berkeley for the upcoming campus appearance from Milo Yiannopoulos. While at the event, UC Berkeley police officers allegedly “refused to allow the officers assisting from various U.C. Police Departments” to intervene with “students and civilians [who] were being brutally beaten by the anarchists.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly reported the events at UC Berkeley and his concerns to Olson and was questioned by Olson upon his return from UC Berkeley. Olson allegedly “received a call from U.C. Berkeley Police Chief Margo Bennett,” who yelled at Olson and was “furious” with Smith for voicing concerns regarding the Milo Yiannopoulos event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further incidents regarding Signa can be viewed on pages 5 through 10 of the court documents. </span></p>\n<p><b>Officer Ryan Hashimoto </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Smith served as sergeant for UCPD, he allegedly “reported several violations of policy and law to Signa,” which continued to create points of retaliation against Smith. Some of those violations pertained to Officer Hashimoto’s alleged misconduct in the office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Officer Hashimoto allegedly “made multiple cartoon videos” of officers, crime victims, citizens, university officials and employees in which he “used his own voice to play the character of each person.” At times, the videos “were discriminatory toward several protected classes of persons.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hashimoto allegedly created a video depicting an officer in the department – referred to as “Officer M” in the complaint – who was known to allegedly contact “female sexual assault victims unsolicited,” as well as sexual assault advocates from the Women’s Center. The video allegedly “depicts the advocates yelling ‘Rape!’ at the victims and forcing the victims to make sexual assault reports.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith also allegedly reported Officer M to Signa after Smith discovered that “Officer M was having sexual assault advocates call his personal phone directly to report cases” without notifying a dispatch or supervisor. Smith ordered Officer M to stop this practice. UCPD allegedly took no action regarding Officer M.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hashimoto’s alleged videos also depicted Chancellor Yang with Officer Hashimoto using a “Chinese accent, making derogatory and inappropriate statements.” Hashimoto also allegedly mocked an African-American dispatcher through “videos and in person impersonations.” Hashimoto’s alleged impersonations of the dispatcher included mockery of the dispatcher “speaking and eating food.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On another occasion, Hashimoto allegedly acted out “a fictional situation where the dispatcher was playing with a large black dildo that Hashimoto named ‘King Kong Dong.’” Officer Hashimoto allegedly “often walked into different areas of the UCPD and would yell ‘King Kong Dong’ while impersonating the dispatchers voice. He would position his forearm in front of his groin area, and then slap his arm on desktops as if he was slapping a dildo on the desktop.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Officer Hashimoto also allegedly “inappropriately joked” and stated to UCPD staff “that the victim in the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/rape-2014-daniel-chen-ucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniel Chen rape and kidnap case</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> contracted herpes from the suspect,” while UCPD was conducting the investigation. Officer Hashimoto allegedly “mocked the victim’s Asian accent, and in the accent stated: ‘I have herpes on my pussy.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In January 2018, while Smith was working in Montecito following the Thomas Fire and the Montecito mudslides, he was shown a recording allegedly made by Hashimoto in which Hashimoto was verbally “mocking an evidence video and audio recording” related to the sexual assault, sodomy, kidnapping and robbery case of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/trial-for-iv-menus-owner-will-begin-in-late-july/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">v.</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Patrick Galoustian</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this video – a tape of Galoustian allegedly “sexual[ly] assaulting a transvestite victim” – Hashimoto allegedly mocked Galoustian’s accent in a voice-over, made sexual references to the victim and made “statements in essence of rubbing their (Galoustian and the trans victim’s penis’ together).”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly reported the video to UCPD on Jan. 27, 2018. At the time, Olson and Lieutenant Millard allegedly confirmed that they were “aware of the recording.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Officer Tiffany Little and Officer Michael Little </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith also reported alleged misconduct from married UCPD officers Tiffany and Michael Little, who “frequently left their assigned patrol areas while on duty and traveled to their personal residence in Goleta using UCPD vehicles.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Littles would also allegedly “stay at their residences for extended periods of time, fail to answer calls for service, and ask other officers to handle calls for service for them.” The suit alleges that the Littles’ actions “are a violation of policy and a theft of funds.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to court documents, Officer Michael Little also allegedly “talked about his fantasy to have a black man try to steal his wallet so he can ‘fucking shoot him in the fucking face.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Officer Michael Little allegedly approached Smith and other officers and “related a fictitious story about how he (Little) is walking through a parking lot and a black man approaches him and tries to rob him of his wallet. Little would then mimic responding by stating, ‘How about I shoot you in the fucking face!’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He would then allegedly “slightly draw his firearm from the holster as if he was going to draw his weapon” while reciting the story. Little allegedly “acted out this fantasy, by telling the story” while he was instructing at the firing range and “fir[ed] his duty weapon multiple times” at the shooting target. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly reported Little’s actions to Signa, but “Signa dismissed the claims against Michael Little and Hashimoto as ‘blowing off steam.’” The suit alleges that “Signa deliberately failed to take any action to further investigate the claims against Tiffany Little because of his personal relationships with these officers.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit further alleges that “Signa conspired with Michael Little, Tiffany Little, and Hashimoto to knowingly file false accusations of misconduct against [Smith] in the form of a personnel complaint,” resulting in an Internal Affairs investigation into Smith and an administrative leave that lasted over a month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly “requested an internal investigation into the false accusations made against him.” As of late March 2019, UCPD has allegedly “failed to investigate the officers who made false allegations against” Smith, according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Smith’s resignation at the end of 2017, Signa allegedly told UCPD staff that Smith resigned “in bad standing, to avoid termination.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly demanded “for the harassment, retaliation, and first amendment violations to cease, no less than ten times since his departure from UCPD” in person to Olson, Farley and Lieutenant Millard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the university allegedly “hired an attorney to investigate” Smith’s complaints, the Littles allegedly “briefed and debriefed several individuals before and after interviews” relating to the investigation and “attempted to recruit members of UCPD” to make complaints against Lieutenant Millard and Olson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that Smith “continues to suffer losses in earnings and other employment benefits as well as past and future non-economic injury.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peter Horton, Smith’s lawyer, wrote in an email to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith attempted to address significant misconduct relating to Lt.

These individuals have responded by attempting to destroy Mr. Smith’s personal and professional reputation.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Smith was forced to take legal action after the University did not take any corrective action against the aforementioned individuals,” Horton said in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada said in an email to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the university “is undertaking a thorough review” of allegations and that they expect the police department “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to adhere to the highest of standards.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A case management conference for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> v. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is scheduled for Wednesday, July 31 at 8:30 a.m. </span></p>\n<p>The court documents in full can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019_03_27_JOHN-DOE_COMPLAINT-FOR-DAMAGES.pdf\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

If you really love it, the stepping stones working towards it are just as rewarding as getting to do it and ending up with that as your job.”  — Taylor Swift</p>\n<p>What does Taylor Swift have to do with sports, the Daily Nexus or my time at UCSB? Technically nothing. In fact, on a scale from one to 10, their correlation would probably be a negative two.</p>\n<p>Yet, this quote perfectly describes my four years with this paper and my two years as the Sports Editor because the fact is, most people search for a lifetime to find a job they love. I was lucky enough to discover my passion for sports journalism at 14. I took my love for writing and abnormally large passion for sports and squished them together. It stuck, and I’ve never looked back.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>At UCSB, it’s only continued to grow. These four years have flown by and now, after studying for more hours than I’d like to count, writing hundreds of articles, spending dozens of late nights/new days in the Nexus office and having countless laughs, I formally say goodbye to the school (and that wonderful beach less than 10 minutes from my doorstep) I love so much.</p>\n<p>SB has truly become my home. My time in Santa Barbara and with the Nexus has only been a part of my journey, but what a journey it’s been.</p>\n<p>In my time here with the Nexus, I’ve written the season of our men’s soccer team that at one point was No. 2 in the nation. I wrote the track season in 2012 when we had athletes make it to Olympic Trials. I’ve done a one-on-one interview with three-time Olympic Gold Medalist Kerri Walsh Jennings. I’ve sat courtside in the Honda Center not once, but twice, to watch our women’s basketball team in the Big West Playoffs, including watching the team win the title in 2012. I’ve won a CCMA award for a column I wrote on Title IX. And most recently, this year, I received the opportunity to interview the Sacramento Kings, my hometown team, during training camp here at UCSB.</p>\n<p>My experience with the Nexus has truly exceeded anything I could ever imagine and I am truly honored to have brought you your sports coverage every day.</p>\n<p>So Gauchos, while I’m going to leave the philosophical stuff to my co-editor, I do have two pieces of advice for you all.</p>\n<p>It may be cliché, but find something you love and never let anyone tell you that you can’t or that you’re not good enough. I tell people all the time I would pay others to do my job. It’s one of the best feelings in the world.<br>\nThe second is to enjoy the sports here. No, we’re not a part of the Pac-12 and we don’t have an elite football team, but we have some fantastic teams here on campus. Give them a shot.</p>\n<p>Finally, I have some major thank yous to give out. First, thank you to my friends and family for your support and always reading my articles when I tell you to. Thank you to the athletic department for not only your verbal, but financial support. Thanks to every coach and athlete I’ve ever interviewed. I know I’m just a pain for you guys a lot of the time, but I really do enjoy and appreciate your time. Thank you to the 2011 softball team, my first ever team with the Nexus, for making me fall in love with sports journalism all over again.</p>\n<p>A very special shout out to the women’s basketball teams the last three years. I’ve written every game covered by the Nexus during the Carlene Mitchell era and some of those moments have been my favorite during my time here. Of course, a very big thank you to Coach Mitch. You’re the coach I’ve most gotten to know on campus and I’ve loved every second talking with you and getting to pick your brain about women’s basketball.</p>\n<p>Thanks to my staff, especially my co-editor PMO (we’ve made the best team), for putting up with my perfectionistic ways deep into the night. And most importantly, to the readers — you are the reason we’ve been the No. 9 newspaper the last two years. Keep it up.</p>\n<p>Because I hate goodbyes, I’m simply going to say see you later, UCSB.<br>\nLove,</p>\n<p>Kristen</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55653\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55653\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/","id":2067,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[2066,2065,2064],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
