And just like the Bears, the Beavers will prove to be yet another challenge worthy of being circled on the calendar as both sides received votes in the latest United Soccer Coaches poll. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the Bulldogs, the start to their season hasn’t gone quite as planned considering the team’s current four-game losing streak places them at a 0-4 overall record on the year. With Gonzaga’s only home game resulting in a 1-2 loss to Sacramento State, a Big West Conference opponent to UCSB, this potential trap game features the Gauchos’ best odds at getting back on track. Although this matchup looks favorable on paper, the record book preaches otherwise. UCSB trails in the all-time series against Gonzaga with an overall record of 2-4-1, as the Gauchos’ previous victory occurred back in 2012; last time out, the Bulldogs were victorious on the road in a 2013 regular season matchup that ended 2-0. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Beavers are in a much better situation at the moment, as Oregon State started their regular season at an overall record of 3-1. Following a 4-1 victory over Pacific earlier in the week, Oregon State has now extended their winning streak to three consecutive games. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their team will face Grand Canyon University on the road Thursday before returning home to host the Gauchos and wrap up their tripleheader. UCSB has a unique opportunity here to notch a historic first-ever win versus Oregon State, as the Gauchos also trail in this one with an overall record of 0-2-1 in the all-time series; these two sides’ last matchup featured a 2-2 double overtime result in the 2012 Gonzaga Nike Classic in Spokane, Washington. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gauchos to keep an eye on for this week are junior defender Hunter Ashworth and senior defender Noah Billingsley. Both players were absent during the loss to Cal due to international duties for the New Zealand squad — they’ll surely make a key impact in returning to Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg’s side. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Theo O’Malley is the one to watch for Gonzaga, as the junior midfielder is tied for team-leading in both most goals (one) and most shots (seven) in his third year for the Bulldogs. The sophomore defender from Spain and Valencia C.F.’s youth system product, Adrian Crespo, is what makes Oregon State tick. The second-year man has a team-leading five total assists and is tied for most goals for the Beavers with two to his name. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB first visits Gonzaga this Thursday, Sept. 12, then plays away again at Oregon State on Sunday, Sept. 15; both games are set to kick off at 7:00 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89791\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-11/ucsb-heads-north-for-doubleheader-matchup-against-gonzaga-and-oregon-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89791\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-11/ucsb-heads-north-for-doubleheader-matchup-against-gonzaga-and-oregon-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-11/ucsb-heads-north-for-doubleheader-matchup-against-gonzaga-and-oregon-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-11/ucsb-heads-north-for-doubleheader-matchup-against-gonzaga-and-oregon-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-11/ucsb-heads-north-for-doubleheader-matchup-against-gonzaga-and-oregon-state/","id":1323,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1322,1321,1320],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites","biography":"Not available","articles":[56,87,92,96,105,107,1004,1028,1033,1040,1076,1080,1112,1113,1124,1131,1134,1135,1149,1153,1155,1161,1163,1164,1167,1168,1171,1174,1193,1199,1200,1203,1206,1207,1264,1281,1288,1289,1292,1293,1302,1306,1308,1311,1316,1317,1319,1323,1337,1379,1381,1384,1386,1395,1396,1398,1496,1512,1526,1642,1645,1661,1664,1778,1779,1780,1782,1783,1784,1861,1882,1888,3340,3345,3361,3382,3383,3395,3414,3420,4826,4829,4832,4872,4873,4874,4878,4882,4915,4917,4918,4936,4938,4939,4940,4941,4942,4944,4945,4946,4947,4948,4949,4968,5555,5556,5558,5562,5563,5583,5589,5590,5591],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"College Cup Team Previews: #1 Louisville Cardinals","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The #1 Louisville men’s soccer team began its 2010 campaign either unranked or ranked at, or near, the bottom of the list in all five of the major college soccer polls.

They gradually climbed the rankings.</p>\n<p>The team won the Big East Tournament over Providence in a penalty kick shootout. Junior forward Colin Rolfe leads the Cardinals’ offensive attack with nine goals and seven assists this season.</p>\n<p>“He has made a difference not only with his goal scoring, but he has created opportunities as well,” Lolla said. “He’s a lot for defenses to handle.”</p>\n<p>He is closely followed by junior midfielder Nick DeLeon and freshman midfielder Dylan Mares, who have each added another six goals and three assists to balance out the Louisville attack.</p>\n<p>Along with redshirt junior goalkeeper Andre Boudreaux, who has allowed .74 goals a match on average, the Cardinals have outscored opponents 47-17 this season.</p>\n<p>After closing out the regular season and Big East playoffs undefeated, the Cardinals earned a seed into the national tournament and skipped the first round of play. In the next round, they faced the College of Charleston, who gave the top seed quite a game. The Cougars stayed neck and neck with the Cardinals throughout the entire match before the Cardinals scored twice in the last six minutes of play to seal a 3-1 victory.</p>\n<p>In front of a University of Kentucky record crowd of 5,562 (an insignificant number compared to the UCSB crowds at Harder), Louisville broke a 1-1 tie in the 63rd minute to advance to the quarterfinals against UCLA — a 5-4 victory that was arguably the most exciting match of the tournament.</p>\n<p>The quarterfinal game between perennial powerhouse UCLA and Louisville may have been the most exciting game in the NCAA tournament this year and has provided the most goals thus far. UCLA struck first in the 8th minute as junior forward Eder Arreola slid a ball past Bourdeaux, and the Cardinals found themselves trailing for the first time in the tournament.</p>\n<p>With just one minute remaining in regulation and the score tied 4-4 against UCLA, freshman forward Aaron Horton dribbled his way through an exhausted Bruin defense to score, giving the Cardinals a 5-4 victory and a ticket to the College Cup in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Louisville defines itself by its resiliency. The team has been to five overtime games this season and won three of them. Its balance of both attack and defense makes Louisville a formidable opponent.</p>\n<p>“It’s a product of being fit enough and having depth,” Lolla said.</p>\n<p>Their next opponent should prove to be another test.

season this past Sunday against Idaho, putting them at an overall record of 1-1-2. Through a balanced attack, Santa Barbara was able to net three goals in the first 20 minutes of the matchup, putting the game out of reach early on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Idaho, 2-4 on the year, came into this game on a two-game losing streak in which they only scored one goal between both games. In their most recent loss to Seattle, the Vandals struggled to find any sort of offensive rhythm which led to only eight shots on goal. Despite struggling out of the gate, Idaho’s roster boasts extremely talented players, including sophomore midfielder Maddie Haas, who has two goals and an assist thus far.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara set an aggressive tone early in the matchup as the Gauchos’ pressure led to early turnovers for the Vandals in their own half of the field. UCSB netted their first goal of the game at the nine-minute mark as freshman midfielder Dylan Lewis was able to sneak the ball behind the defense, leading to sophomore forward Jessica Wright pushing it past the outstretched arm of the Idaho goalkeeper.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The squad kept up their pressure and were rewarded soon after as junior midfielder Christine Maurer was able to score her first goal of the season. Maurer is one of the key players who many believe will keep the pressure off of senior star forward Shaelan Murison and provide consistency on the offensive end for Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shortly after in the 20th minute, Murison would score a goal to put the Gauchos up 3-0, giving her squad a comfortable lead with over 70 minutes left to play. It was an encouraging sight for UCSB as the team stepped up offensively and used their defense to create opportunities for goals on the transition attack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, Idaho had a difficult time getting past the Gaucho defense as the Vandals only had two shots on goal that were both comfortably saved by senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese. DeWeese tallied her second clean sheet of the season and has looked extremely confident in front of goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were a lot of positives to take away from this matchup, but the one that stuck out the most was the growing chemistry among the players. It is apparent that as each game goes by, the starters will be more comfortable playing with each other, and this will hopefully lead to more wins. With both youth and experience currently on the roster, the expectation for UCSB is to win and compete for a title. While that is a tall task, this group has shown signs that they can accomplish that feat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though Murison will surely be double-teamed inside of the box in future games, there is a strong belief amongst the team that they can find the back of the net even if Murison is not directly involved in the play. As her teammates find more opportunities to score, it will be difficult for opposing teams to continue to double-team Murison as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It will be crucial for Santa Barbara to continue to develop their identity as well, but it is starting to look like they will rely on their defense to create offensive opportunities for themselves. As this team becomes more consistent, it will surely be fun to watch them develop and hopefully contend for the Big West Title as the season goes on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is back at home this upcoming Friday against Grand Canyon at 7 p.m. inside Harder Stadium, as the ’Chos look to get their second win of the season. </span></p><div

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB women’s soccer team was unable to grab their first win of the season this past Friday against Cal as they lost by a score of 2-0. With only one shot on goal, Santa Barbara was unable to establish any kind of rhythm, leading to a comfortable win for the Golden Bears. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal was last in action against Weber State where the Bears dominated and won by a score of 5-0. Junior midfielder Luca Deza was able to find the back of the net twice against the Wildcats. Although it was only the first game of the season, it was very clear that Cal’s roster is filled with talented players across the board and that the Gauchos would have to be on top of their game in order to upset the Bears. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the first half, both teams struggled to find opportunities on the offensive end. Much of this can be attributed to the stout defense on both sides, particularly the on-ball pressure in the midfield area. That being said, Santa Barbara had their chances as they had five corners in the first half but were unable to execute in the final third of the field. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a scoreless first half, Cal would finally convert a goal three minutes into the second half after a header from redshirt sophomore Denae Antoine that was able to just get past the outstretched arm of UCSB’s senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese. It was a momentary lapse in concentration by the ‘Chos defense as they let Antoine find space in the penalty box where she was able to redirect the ball into the back of the net. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twenty minutes later, the Bears would get their second goal of the night as junior forward Emma Westin converted a cross to put Cal up by two goals, essentially putting the game out of reach. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a struggle throughout the entire game for Santa Barbara on offense as UCSB struggled to put pressure on Cal’s freshman goalkeeper Angelina Anderson. Anderson only had to save one shot on goal as the rest of the Gauchos’ seven shots were off the mark.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for Santa Barbara to get their first win of the season in the next week, it will be important for them to develop an identity on the offensive side of the field. While the squad is very effective on the defensive side of the field, they will not be able to win most of their games without finding the back of the net multiple times in a given game. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior forward Shaelan Murison will be one of the key players regarding whether UCSB will be able to find consistency on the offensive end. As the team’s leading goal scorer from a year ago, there is a lot of responsibility that has been put on her shoulders as the team looks to take the next step towards a Big West Championship. Even though Murison is an important piece, her teammates must also find a way to make an impact as well as opposing teams will surely double team her inside of the box. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One positive takeaway from this matchup was the play of DeWeese as she had a total of five saves. DeWeese has proven to be extremely consistent in front of the net and has cemented her role as a leader for the team as well.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara will look to pick up their first win of the season as the ‘Chos are back in action next Friday in their first away game of the season against Montana at 4:00 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89693\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-01/ucsb-womens-soccer-shut-out-by-golden-bears/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89693\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-01/ucsb-womens-soccer-shut-out-by-golden-bears/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-01/ucsb-womens-soccer-shut-out-by-golden-bears/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-01/ucsb-womens-soccer-shut-out-by-golden-bears/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-01/ucsb-womens-soccer-shut-out-by-golden-bears/","id":1320,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[1319,1318,1317],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
