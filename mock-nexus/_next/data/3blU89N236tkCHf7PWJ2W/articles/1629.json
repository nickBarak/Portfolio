In a season marked by unlucky stretches of play and unfortunate injuries to key players, the Gauchos can still salvage a win for their seniors and end the season on a high note as they look forward to next year.</p>\n<p>“We want to come off for a win for next season and plus we just want to reward ourselves for how well we’ve been playing lately,” sophomore midfielder Indiana Mead said. “We want to make sure we get the third win and make sure that our ranking is still pretty good … We want to work really hard and come off with a positive note for the season.”</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara enters its final match with an overall record of 5-10- 2 and is in a tie for seventh place with UC Davis in the Big West with a 2-5-1 conference record. UCSB was eliminated from the playoffs after losing to UC Riverside last Sunday. Meanwhile, with 17 points earned against conference opponents this season, the Mustangs are in first place in the league with an overall record of 8-6-3 and 5-1-2 in conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Coming off its first conference loss against Cal State Fullerton and earning a draw against UCR, the Mustangs will try to rebound against the Gauchos. Despite being in first place, Cal Poly still has not mathematically qualified for a spot in the Big West Tournament and the Gauchos will look to play spoiler, as a loss could endanger the Mustang’s chances of competing in the postseason.</p>\n<p>“They do play a system where there are some pluses and minuses for us and against us, so we’re going to do everything we can to play to our strengths and avoid those weaknesses,”</p>\n<p>Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “It’d be great [to win]. They’re our closest rival, the schools are very similar — we recruit a lot of the same players. You always want to beat your cross town rival.”</p>\n<p>A huge reason Cal Poly is in position to capture its first Big West title since 2009 is freshman goalkeeper Alyssa Giannetti, who leads the conference with 6.65 saves per game and 113 overall saves. Santa Barbara plans on creating havoc in the box for Giannetti after scoring four goals against Fullerton and outshooting Riverside 13-5 in last weekend’s matches.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to look up some game film and we’re going to come up with a system and style that is best going to suit us to have more of the ball,” Stumpf said. “Because of that, [hopefully we will] get some momentum and get more looks at the goal and hopefully stick them away.”</p>\n<p>Containing the Cal Poly offense will be a difficult task for Santa Barbara as the Mustangs enter with the No. 1 ranked offense in the league, scoring a conference-high 1.88 goals per game and 19 goals in total. Stopping freshman forward Elise Krieghoff will be top priority for the Gaucho’s backline. Krieghoff has top rank in the Big West in goals scored with 10 on the season.</p>\n<p>Despite having to settle for a record under .500, the Gauchos are still proud of what they have accomplished this season.</p>\n<p>“I think that our entire season we played really well; our record doesn’t show how hard we worked,” Mead said. “I’m really proud of the whole effort everyone has put in and just coming together as a team. It has been a very awesome year even though the record doesn’t show it.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff for Sunday’s Blue-Green rivalry match is set for 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48431\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/gauchos-face-rival-cal-poly-match-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48431\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/gauchos-face-rival-cal-poly-match-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/gauchos-face-rival-cal-poly-match-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/gauchos-face-rival-cal-poly-match-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/gauchos-face-rival-cal-poly-match-season/","id":1629,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1628,1627,1626],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Ready to Reclaim Big West Crown","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/JakeCollins_MSoccer_100512_302.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/JakeCollins_MSoccer_100512_302.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After missing the postseason for the first time in six seasons after injuries rattled the squad, the UCSB men’s soccer team looks to once again return to its place atop the Big West Conference this ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After missing the postseason for the first time in six seasons after injuries rattled the squad, the UCSB men’s soccer team looks to once again return to its place atop the Big West Conference this season. Picked to finish first in the Big West North Division by the media, the Gauchos enter this season with one goal in mind: Improvement.<br>\n“We have high expectations, but I feel like the expectations are based off of getting the players back who were hurt and the addition of some very, very good young players who I think are going to help us right away,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “I think those two ingredients are going to help us do very well this year.”<br>\nHeadlining the returning Gauchos is senior defensive midfielder Fifi Baiden who garnered All-Big West First Team honors last season. Once again picked by the media as All-Big West in the preseason, Baiden will anchor a defensive backline that will be the strength of the Gauchos this season.<br>\n“Our back line is our strength. We have experience and we’ve played in so many games together,” Baiden said. “It’s actually really good for the team in terms of communicating and helping the new players to settle in with the team. It’s going to be the key for us this year.”<br>\nAlso named as the No. 38 player in the entire country by TopDrawerSoccer.com, Baiden will look to lead the Gauchos this season with his usual defensive oriented play.<br>\n“It’s fun to be recognized and it shows that you’re doing something good,” Baiden said. “My philosophy, personally, I see myself as a team guy. I don’t want to force myself to do anything to hurt the team. Being recognized nationally also gives me the hope that I am not doing a bad job.”<br>\nJoining Baiden on the preseason list for top players nationwide includes senior forward Achille Campion at No. 100. Campion missed much of last year due to injury but will be the focus of the offensive attack this season for Santa Barbara.<br>\n“Our leading goal scorer literally would have been Campion, and of course, he got hurt some games in the season,” Vom Steeg said. “We anticipate him having a real big season for us. [Senior midfielder] Goffin Boyoko is another player who played hurt all last year. He’s another player who will give us goals.”<br>\nWhile defense certainly seems to be the strength for the Gauchos, it will be up to the pair of seniors in Boyoko and Campion, along with a talented group of newcomers to give the offensive attack some new life that was missing last season.<br>\nIncluded in the list of newcomers expected to contribute immediately are junior forward Reed McKenna, a transfer from UCLA, and a pair of freshman in midfielder Paul Ehmann and forward Ismaila Jome.<br>\n“We’re a bigger team (than last season),” Vom Steeg said. “We have a couple of players who can serve the ball very well and I think when you put that mix together, we’re going to be able to get some goals off of set pieces.”<br>\nUCSB plays its first regular season game against No. 19 Northwestern University on Friday in Evanston, Illinois. Kickoff is scheduled for 5 p.m. Pacific Time.</p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Jake Collins

ready to attack. They took eight shots in the first 30 minutes of the match, forcing Cal Poly to retreat further and further back to their own side of the pitch. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A large part of this aggressive mindset has to be attributed to the return of defenders Hunter Ashworth and Noah Billingsley from their international duties. The two Kiwis had a sharp turnaround this week, qualifying for the Tokyo Olympics with the U-23 New Zealand national team on Friday before flying back to Santa Barbara on Saturday to play in the Blue-Green rivalry game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashworth in particular made his presence known early on, making defensive stops and putting a couple of quick shots up in the opening minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos continued to press the Mustang defense as the half wore on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 31st minute, junior transfer Ameyawu Muntari shot a rocket toward the Cal Poly goal that ricocheted out to junior Rodney Michael on the right wing. Michael gathered the ball on his right foot and sent a perfect cross into the box towards an unmarked Carter Clemmensen who took the ball home to give UCSB a 1-0 lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a slow start to the season, Michael is hitting his stride at just the right time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The star forward knocked in a goal in the Gauchos’ last two matches, but he has also transformed into more of a playmaker as well. He opened up the second half with a shot on goal and in the 52nd minute, he took the ball down the right wing yet again and drove a low cross into the box towards Clemmensen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clemmensen put a foot on the ball and it ricocheted off Mustang defender Josh Graham for an own goal, doubling the Gaucho lead to 2-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal Poly wasn’t ready to give up yet however, and the Mustangs revved up the physicality of the match in the second half. There were five yellow cards given out for both teams combined in the last 40 minutes of the game, including a second yellow and red card for Mustang midfielder Colin Hyatt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This increase in fouls shook the Gauchos off their game a little bit, and that small lapse was all that Cal Poly needed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With just about ten minutes to go, redshirt freshman Zack DiDonato was on the receiving end of a Mustang corner kick which he passed to forward Angel De Leon, who poked the ball into the back of the net.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like that, the lead was down to one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any dream of a Cal Poly comeback was dashed just a few minutes later however, when freshman phenom Finn Ballard McBride dribbled the ball out to around 23 yards and sent in a strike past the Mustang goalkeeper, putting UCSB up 3-1 and effectively ending the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was a much needed win for the Gauchos if they hope to work their way up the rankings and earn an at-large bid in the NCAA tournament. They will have to keep winning at home, especially as conference season kicks off this week when they take on Sacramento State on Wednesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now though, UCSB can celebrate knowing that we have the upper hand (and bragging rights) over our biggest rival.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

id=\"caption-attachment-90277\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / The Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB women’s soccer team began conference play with a hard fought 1-0 win at home against defending Big West Champion Long Beach State on Sunday. This was their second win in a row and their fourth in their last five games. Dylan Lewis’ goal in the 13th minute propelled the Gauchos to the win and improved their record to 5-3-3 overall and 1-0 in the Big West. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long Beach State won the Big West regular season and tournament championship last year and they were picked to do it again in 2019, according to the Big West Preseason Coaches Poll. They came into Sunday’s match with a 3-7 overall record and some momentum following a 2-1 win at Cal Poly on Thursday. Sunday’s game was a chance for them to make a statement early on in Big West play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it was UCSB that attacked early, as the team put up four shots in the first 13 minutes, with the final attempt finding the net via the left leg of Dylan Lewis and assisted by Shaelan Murison. The goal was Lewis’ second of the season and second in the last two games as she has been putting herself in good positions to score of late.

Her two saves contributed to the second straight complete game shutout for DeWeese and her fifth in total on the year. DeWeese is currently all over the Big West leaderboard in goalkeeping stats; she is fourth in saves with 35, third in save percentage at .778 and first overall in goals-against average at 0.86 goals allowed per game. If her non-conference play can translate to the Big West portion of the schedule, the team will benefit and DeWeese will surely be an All-Conference player.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB won in part due to their offense’s continued attack of the goal, and their 12 shots and six shots on goal tell the story when compared to LBSU’s six shots and two shots on goal. This is the usual formula that Gaucho wins follow, where they are able to wear down the opposing defenders and goalkeeper until someone can slip a ball or two past the goalie. When UCSB is playing well like this, their offensive attack allows their defense to rest while the ball is on the other end, and they then have more energy to defend their own goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another big storyline for this game is that UCSB was without their usual starters Christine Maurer, Emma Vanderhyden and Lynsee Voss. This forced in a lot of new players into roles they are not entirely familiar with, and the reserves clearly stepped up, especially on the defensive end where the goalie never had to do too much work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, the Gauchos will travel up to UC Davis where they will face the Aggies, a team desperate for their first conference win. The game will take place on Thursday Oct. 10 at 4 p.m. in Davis.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90276\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-08/ucsb-womens-soccer-team-blanks-long-beach-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90276\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-08/ucsb-womens-soccer-team-blanks-long-beach-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-08/ucsb-womens-soccer-team-blanks-long-beach-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-08/ucsb-womens-soccer-team-blanks-long-beach-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-08/ucsb-womens-soccer-team-blanks-long-beach-state/","id":1627,"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone"},"related":[1626,1625,1624],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
