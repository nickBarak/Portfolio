Both wins Santa Barbara achieved last week against the Golden Grizzlies and the Buckeyes were of the one-goal variety with the latter game being won in overtime thanks to a clutch goal from junior midfielder Kevin Feucht. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s two opponents this weekend, aforementioned USD and St. Mary’s (Calif.), trail in the team’s all-time record against each other at 12-6 and 6-4, respectively. San Diego currently comes into this matchup at 1-0-1 with its one win coming against Elon College.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last time these two squads faced off was last year in a late September match which saw the home team Gauchos trounce their opponents 4-0. This year, however, the Toreros will look to put up more of a fight thanks to senior standouts Parker Price, Merlin Hoeckendorff and Michael Turner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All three were named to the John Rennie Nike Invitational All-Tournament Team after solid performances including Turner and Hoeckendorff each scoring one goal. Turner, a midfielder, has been a consistent threat for San Diego starting in 50 games in the previous three years, scoring nine goals and assisting on 10 and being a key reason why the Toreros have won their conference championship three of the last four years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While USD will look to avenge an embarrassing loss from the previous year, St. Mary’s will look to pick up its first win of the season. No type of revenge will be a factor in the Gaels and Gauchos matchup as both teams haven’t met since early in the 2002 season which saw UCSB winning 6-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Instead, St. Mary’s will look to forget about its two draws last weekend against then No. 23 Cal and then No. 1 Stanford. Both matches ended in 2-2 ties with the match against Stanford being a harder pill to swallow as the Gaels blew a 2-0 lead with less than 15 minutes to go in the contest. To make matters worse, the Gaels lost a Thursday matchup to Washington 2-1 with the deciding goal coming in the 87th minute.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65525\" style=\"width: 326px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65525\" data-attachment-id=\"65525\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-19/gauchos-drop-second-straight-in-front-of-near-record-crowd-at-cal-poly/kevin-feucht-battles-the-ball-away-from-a-defender-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccer_vsAkron-20150925-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"Kevin Feucht battles the ball away from a defender.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though St. Mary’s is not currently ranked nationally, it is clear that after solid performances against two Top-25 teams, including the No. 1 team in the country, that it will be no easy foe to take on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gaels are led by senior defender Rafael Sanchez and sophomore midfielder Stephen Dougherty who both lead the team with three points, one goal and one assist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If St. Mary’s hopes to pull off the upset, it will need to fix its second half defense as it has been outscored 4-2. All four goals have also been scored past the 70-minute mark meaning stamina is a factor for this team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While no game on the schedule is ever easy, it is made easier knowing you have a star player like senior forward Nick DePuy. Although the MAC Hermann Trophy Watch List player has yet to net a goal this season, he has assisted in one of the three scores UCSB has nailed this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping DePuy will be All-Tournament Team members from last week’s Wolstein Classic: senior midfielder Josue España, sophomore defender Sam Strong and Feucht. España scored two goals in the Gauchos exhibition match two weeks ago and continued that hot streak into the regular season scoring his first goal last week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feucht had the aforementioned game-winning goal against Ohio State in overtime and Strong has been a key defender as well as a big reason Santa Barbara has only allowed one goal this season. Of course, goalkeeper Titouan Le Roux has also been great and a big part as to why only one goal has gotten past them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another thing the Gauchos have going for them is, of course, the home factor. It’s no secret UCSB is a powerhouse soccer school and the crowd usually plays a big part in that. Since 2009, Santa Barbara has posted a 56-18-7 home record. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos face off against the Toreros at 8:00 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 2 at Harder Stadium. UCSB will then face St. Mary’s at 7:05 p.m. on Sunday, Sept. 4 at Harder Stadium. Both matches are following the women’s matches who has a perfect record as well this season.

That’s what we strive for.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton also qualifies for the NCAA Tournament for the third consecutive year and will play Santa Clara in the first round on Thursday. Head Coach George Kuntz improved to an outstanding record of 13-1-1 in the Big West Tournament with the win, earning his sixth Big West title in the process.</p>\n<p>In a match that was dominated by the Gauchos from the opening whistle, it felt for much of the game as if the home side was bound to score at any moment. UCSB saw several close scoring chances in the first half clang off the crossbar, including a free kick by sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht from 30 yards out.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara headed into the break with a 9-2 advantage in shots and the game’s only shot on frame through 45 minutes.</p>\n<p>The second half began with a bit of a momentum change as UCSB’s freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg was subbed out due to injury and Fullerton found itself with possession more consistently.</p>\n<p>“Justin’s been dealing with a shoulder issue for about 2-3 weeks now. He warmed up today before the game and dove and he said he just can’t dive to his right,” Tim Vom Steeg said. “Realistically, he’s probably not going to get through the season. Obviously Justin is very disappointed right now.”</p>\n<p>Although recording just two shots in the first half, the Titans doubled that mark in a matter of seconds, as Bell gave Fullerton all it would need to come away with the upset victory. After a throw in, a shot from the right side by senior midfielder Julian Okai came hard off the right post and fell right to Bell, who knocked in his first goal of the season past sophomore goalkeeper Brandon Berke in the 52<sup>nd</sup> minute.</p>\n<p>“When the throw went in, unfortunately [junior midfielder Josue Espana] just couldn’t clear it. It’s just luck, really. They got the ball and they scored,” sophomore center back Fuad Adeniyi said. “Tonight I think the whole back four did a really good job, but unfortunately that’s the game that we play. One slip-up, one mistake can cost you the whole thing.”</p>\n<p>The shocking turnaround forced the Gauchos to go into an all-out offensive mode, putting attacking players in at nearly every position outside of center back. Junior Ismaila Jome led the onslaught down the left wing, beating defenders and sending in a number of crosses for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB finally got the chance it was looking for in the 82<sup>nd</sup> minute, after junior forward Nick DePuy blocked a pass in the midfield which led to his own breakaway. Before the nation’s second-leading goalscorer could get a shot away, he was taken down from behind by Fullerton’s Ricardo Covarrubias just outside the box, who was sent off with a straight red card.</p>\n<p>Playing up a man, the Gauchos continued to send everything they had forward, resulting in their best scoring opportunity of the game in the 85<sup>th</sup> minute. DePuy working a perfect 1-2 combination with freshman defender Sam Strong on the right side of the box, but his right-footed strike went wide of the far post and the Gauchos’ attempted comeback fell short soon after.</p>\n<p>“The sequence with about seven minutes left was our best soccer,” the older Vom Steeg said. “You’ve got Nick at that back post with everything to shoot at and he’s your best scorer. We had him 8 yards out to tie the game up a man and we know where that would’ve gone with them having the red card.”</p>\n<p>DePuy led his team with eight shots, three more than the entire Fullerton team, but UCSB was hurt by the fact that only six of its 22 shots were on goal. It was just the third time all season that Santa Barbara reached the 20-shot mark.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have not won a Big West Championship since 2010 and last played in the final in 2011, when they lost to UC Irvine 3-2. The road to their first NCAA championship since 2006 begins on Sunday when they host either South Carolina or Furman in the NCAA Tournament Second Round.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66505\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66505\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/","id":1472,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1471,1470,1469],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 13 Gauchos Gear Up for Beginning of Season, Host Westmont","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_vsFullerton-20151114-DustinHarris-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_vsFullerton-20151114-DustinHarris-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Despite being a No. 15 seed in the NCAA Tournament, the UCSB men's soccer team managed to reach the Sweet 16 for the seventh time in program history and for the first time since 2011.

Eric Swenson/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Neither No. 19 UCSB nor South Carolina could find a goal during regulation in their NCAA Tournament Second Round battle on Sunday night, but it took less than three minutes in the first overtime before junior attacking midfielder Ismaila Jome placed a perfect strike with his weaker right foot from 20 yards out to give UCSB its first NCAA Tournament win since 2011. The win earns the Gauchos a ticket to face No. 2 Clemson next Sunday in their seventh Sweet Sixteen appearance in program history.</p>\n<p>“It never gets old playing in the NCAA Tournament and I thought we were excited and ready to play tonight,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We all know Ish’s season has been rough with [a sprained left ankle], but at least he picked the right foot to finish with that one.”</p>\n<p>After failing to win a postseason game the past two seasons, Santa Barbara has another chance to prolong a magical season in which it has gone 14-6-2 overall and 2-1 in playoffs. The Gamecocks conclude their season with a record of 11-8-2 after playing one of the most difficult schedules in the nation.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“This season I’ve been injured, it’s been frustrating but the team has done really well getting this 15 seed and first round bye,” Jome said. “It’s just been wonderful to win and get past the second round which has been a barrier for us the past couple seasons.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C6qnyWjgHu4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>While the Gauchos had been dominated for much of the second half, they regrouped towards the end of regulation and came out strong in the overtime period, holding South Carolina without a shot attempt for the final 20:17 of play.</p>\n<p>“I was very proud of the strength and mental toughness that our guys showed,” South Carolina Head Coach Mark Berson said. “The big thing was we were able to link up passes, keep the ball, take a little pressure off ourselves. Credit to our guys that as the match went on, we got stronger, and I’m very proud of that.”</p>\n<p>That set the stage for Jome, who had just nearly scored on a header one minute prior, to pick up his third goal of the season and the biggest of his life. The final sequence began with junior midfielder Andy Perez whipping it into the box for junior forward Nick DePuy. The nation’s leader in game-winning goals nearly notched his ninth of the year, but his off-balanced, slightly deflected shot from seven yards out was cleared off the line by junior defender Matt McManis.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for UCSB, the ball fell right to Jome outside the 18-yard box. Although he has reminded us of just how dangerous he can be with his play during the postseason, setting up defenders to one side before bursting to his stronger left has become predictable at times. This time, Jome took on the defense to his right, catching Gamecock sophomore goalkeeper William Pyle off-guard as he placed the shot perfectly inside the far post.</p>\n<p>“I was going to cross it but they had two defenders blocking my left, so I thought ‘Why don’t I just go right for once?’” Jome said. “I had been practicing it in the spring, so I go right and I just hit it and thankfully it went in.”</p>\n<p>Multiple announcements had been made throughout the game warning fans that they would be ejected for throwing tortillas, but after being shutout for the previous 194 minutes playing at home, the sea of fans finally had its chance to erupt along with a cloud of blue smoke as the Gauchos celebrated emotionally on side of the field nearest to the crowd.</p>\n<p>It was a tale of two halves as UCSB outshot South Carolina 10-1 through the first 45 minutes before the road side stole all momentum in the second stanza.</p>\n<p>“[South Carolina] is a good team, so you can’t keep running at them the whole time,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>The game felt eerily similar to the Gauchos’ loss to Fullerton in the Big West Championship, as the Gamecocks came very close on a number of occasions in the second half, but were unable to place one past sophomore goalkeeper Brandon Berke, who for the second game was filling in for injured freshman Justin Vom Steeg.</p>\n<p>“I thought Berke did everything we asked for,” Tim Vom Steeg said. “He was clean, punched a couple balls he had to punch. He is not going to cost you the game and he’s been training great, so tonight we went with the goalie who was 100 percent.”</p>\n<p>Other than the goal, the play of the day was provided by sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht, who led the Gauchos with four shots. Off a corner kick in the 37th minute, Feucht lined up a dazzling bicycle kick, which he hit perfectly on target. Pyle was in the perfect position to save it though as he was for most of the game, as he racked up one of seven big saves on the night.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have now given up just one goal in their last four games, having found a lineup that works with senior Duncan Backus moving from right back to defensive midfielder. Perez was moved to right back in the game and played superbly, making clutch stops when he needed to and providing a great spark down the right wing.</p>\n<p>“Andy is a player who works hard for us, he’s disciplined enough, he tracks, he’s a hard working two-way midfielder,” Vom Steeg said. “The key in that whole move was simply getting Duncan back in the middle of the field, and if you’ve seen we’ve controlled almost 70 percent of these games now.”</p>\n<p>With the game potentially heading into penalties, Justin Vom Steeg warmed up from the bench, despite being held out with a bruised shoulder.</p>\n<p>His recovery will be watched throughout the week as he hopes to suit up for his team against No. 2 seed Clemson on Sunday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66736\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/jomes-right-footed-strike-in-ot-sends-no-19-ucsb-to-sweet-16/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66736\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/jomes-right-footed-strike-in-ot-sends-no-19-ucsb-to-sweet-16/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/jomes-right-footed-strike-in-ot-sends-no-19-ucsb-to-sweet-16/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/jomes-right-footed-strike-in-ot-sends-no-19-ucsb-to-sweet-16/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/jomes-right-footed-strike-in-ot-sends-no-19-ucsb-to-sweet-16/","id":1474,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1473,1472,1471],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
