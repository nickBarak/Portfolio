While these tragic mishaps are unpredictable events that no sports fan desires, these injuries have clearly developed into stumbling blocks for teams during this postseason.</p>\n<p>Take Game 6 of the Los Angeles Clippers and Portland Trailblazers series, for example. Instead of seeing the Clippers’ floor general in Chris Paul finish his toe-to-toe bout with Portland star Damian Lillard, a right hand fracture forced the Clippers’ guard to sit on the sidelines and watch his younger teammate Austin Rivers take on a responsibility only Paul could confidently do: command the team at point.</p>\n<p>Friday night’s matchup did showcase the perseverance and potential of an athlete like Rivers, bouncing back from a bloody left eye injury and embracing the true spirit of competition with a playoff career-high 21 points.</p>\n<p>However, the Clippers arguably could have extended the series and headed back to L.A. for Game 7 if a healthy CP3 and Blake Griffin suited up for their team.</p>\n<p>The loss of two-time champ Chris Bosh has also been a hardship for the Miami Heat to overcome despite their recent series blowout victory Sunday afternoon. An alarming blood clot in the forward’s calf has not only kept Bosh out of commission since the All-Star break, but more notably created a disadvantage for his team.</p>\n<p>In what many considered could have been a sweep against a lower seeded Charlotte Hornets team, this first round matchup resulted in a full seven game series.</p>\n<p>With the absence of Bosh, guard Dwayne Wade has emerged as the sole leader once again and is carrying his team. “The Flash” resembled his 2006 NBA Finals play in order to escape elimination en route to the team’s advancement to the second round.</p>\n<p>While the 13-year vet managed to silence Hornets’ fans with his exceptional postseason play, he surely could utilize his 6’11” teammate as they move deeper into the playoffs.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70597\" style=\"width: 564px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70597\" data-attachment-id=\"70597\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/nba-playoffs-submerged-in-injuries/ap-aptopix-heat-hornets-basketball-s-bkn-usa-nc/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d-wade-2.jpg?fit=1000%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,666\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d-wade-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d-wade-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-70597\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d-wade-2.jpg?resize=554%2C369\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of ftw.usatoday.com\" width=\"554\" height=\"369\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d-wade-2.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d-wade-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/d-wade-2.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-70597\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of ftw.usatoday.com</p></div>\n<p>Even the Golden State Warriors, the untouchable reigning champs that pulled off a historic 73-9 regular season record are currently experiencing their own dilemma, arguably the biggest red flag yet in this year’s NBA Playoffs.</p>\n<p>Sending James Harden and Dwight Howard on an empty-handed flight back to Houston, the Pacific Division champs did so at a cost.</p>\n<p>After losing the heart and soul of their team Stephen Curry to a nasty MCL sprain in Game 4 versus the Rockets, “Dub Nation” has depended on veteran Shaun Livingston and newcomer Ian Clark to take the place of the “Baby-Faced Assassin.”</p>\n<p>While the Warriors certainly justified their motto “Strength in Numbers” with a first round knockout and a Game 1 victory versus the Trailblazers, Curry’s questionable timetable certainly factors into how long Golden State will continue to tame Portland’s backcourt duo of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, this injury stricken playoffs start has highlighted how not all teams have it easy in their quest for an NBA Championship. Some teams have been able to persevere through the pain, while others’ seasons have been derailed with pivotal blows to their roster.</p>\n<p>These distressing injuries to Curry, Bosh, Griffin and Paul are all unfortunate strokes of bad luck for their respective squads, but serve a purpose in exemplifying the complexity of this year’s NBA playoffs.</p>\n<p>Now NBA fans must be mindful of the burdens their favorite teams carry forward and are left with the current question until early June of who is likely to hoist that Larry O’Brien trophy.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70593\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/nba-playoffs-submerged-in-injuries/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70593\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/nba-playoffs-submerged-in-injuries/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/nba-playoffs-submerged-in-injuries/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/nba-playoffs-submerged-in-injuries/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/nba-playoffs-submerged-in-injuries/","id":1962,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1961,1960,1959],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton","biography":"Not available","articles":[324,325,330,331,332,333,334,335,336,339,344,346,348,352,367,371,1387,1459,1460,1461,1466,1479,1480,1484,1488,1489,1499,1500,1503,1505,1506,1513,1524,1528,1529,1900,1959,1962,1976,1983,1988,1990,1995,3260,3281,3282,3303,3307,3324,3359],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Stalking Reports Increased, Disciplinary Action for Drug Violations Decreased in 2018","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-10-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_0383.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_0383.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The report includes crimes reported to the UCPD and other campus security agencies.

future physicians fight a common affliction in doctors: burnout. </span><em>Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to its </span><a href=\"https://professional.ucsb.edu/certificate-medical-humanities#ready\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the new Medical Humanities Certificate provides students with a “foundation in humanities which can lead to increased empathy, more understanding of historical and social contexts of disease, and a better resiliency to burnout.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Jason Prystowsky, the certificate coordinator, said the program quickly came together after a “year of strategic planning.” He explained that he and his colleagues saw a need for humanities in the medical field, for the benefit of both pre-medical students and their future patients. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s kind of an existential threat, almost, of young professionals who have an incredible command of the science and technical expertise and are brilliant and creative but don’t understand the power of narrative or social context, or how poverty is related to health,” he said</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prystowsky said the certificate is well-designed to compliment pre-medical students’ schedules, and it gives students the freedom to pursue sub-specialties of the humanities that interest them and relate to their career goals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To obtain the certificate, students must take two extension courses in the fall and spring quarters, in addition to ten units of approved UCSB </span><a href=\"https://ucsantabarbaraextension.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018938314-Medical-Humanities-Electives\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">electives</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from various disciplines that relate to the certificate material, according to the website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not a major, it’s not a minor, it’s a certificate,” Prystowsky said. “So students who have a very robust science and lab schedule can squeeze it in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fall quarter course for the program, Introduction to Medical Humanities (</span><a href=\"https://enroll.professional.ucsb.edu/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&amp;courseId=31799263\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">INT X410</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), is currently taught by an interdisciplinary team of nine university faculty members, according to Prystowsky. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the certificate courses have a different teaching format from the required classes for pre-medical students, the classes use readings and films that are catered specifically toward pre-medical students, Prystowsky said. The curriculum for INT X410 even includes watching an episode of the television series “Scrubs,” which Prystowsky believes offers a great view of popular culture narratives surrounding medicine. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will not give you a book to read or a lecture that does not have the intent of making you a better physician one day,” Prystowsky said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second class, to be offered for the first time in Spring Quarter 2020, is Medical Humanities in the World (</span><a href=\"https://enroll.professional.ucsb.edu/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&amp;courseId=31799270\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">INTX 411</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). The class will focus on how the humanities can be directly applied to the medical field, exploring topics such as spirituality, mortality and structural racism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every different community is going to have a different way of looking at health, and a different narrative and have a different historical context,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another goal of the program is to equip future physicians with the ability to fight a common affliction in young doctors: burnout. Part of the spring quarter course, INTX 411, will focus on preparing students to be resilient in their future professions, Prystowsky said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In a lot of ways, burnout is compassion fatigue,” Prystowsky said. “I think having a better understanding of historical context, cultural appreciation, poetry, art and literature, is another tool in that toolbox that young physicians can use to thwart burnout.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Prystowsky said students pursuing the certificate do have to pay for the extension classes — though fundraising for the new program is in progress — students are encouraged to pursue Humanities and Fine Arts (HFA) scholarships to offset costs; a 50% discount was also offered to all UCSB students for INTX 410 this fall, according to the certificate website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A medical humanities curriculum is currently required at 69 out of the 133 accredited medical schools in the country, and Prystowsky believes future medical students will benefit from building a foundation during their undergraduate time at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is value in giving students exposure to it before they set foot in a medical school campus. We’re planting seeds.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the Oct. 17, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

\r\n</script> \n<p>The Kings, a franchise still torn from their Western Conference loss to the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2002 Western Conference Finals, have experienced its share of unpleasant seasons since their pursuit of a championship.</p>\n<p>Following its relocation in 1985 from Kansas City to Sacramento, the team has experienced a nine-year playoff drought since losing 4-2 to the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the 2006 NBA Playoffs.</p>\n<p>Despite a 65-year gap since the team’s first and only Finals appearance and title in 1951, Kings’ fans remain faithfully grounded and trust that their team will once again assemble the unique components that made them special: winning.</p>\n<p>The change in scenery with the implementation of Golden One Center could help with this favorable shift for the franchise.</p>\n<p>A city cherished for its Gold Rush history and title as the epicenter of California, this energetic enthusiasm that once buzzed through the streets of Sacramento has long been absent for the capital city.</p>\n<p>While a young Demarcus “Boogie” Cousins keeps the city hopeful with his All-Star talent, the sporadic mixing of coaches and players has prohibited Sac-town from producing a winning basketball team reminiscent of the success achieved by players such as Mike Bibby, Peja Stojakovic and former “Fab Five” member Chris Webber.</p>\n<p>Having not achieved a winning record since the team’s last playoff trip, it is this tradition of losing that current owner and Chairman Vivek Ranadivé looks to erase.</p>\n<p>In his second year with the Kings, Ranadivé has encouraged his fellow community to stand strong during this disheartening time. Looking to spark fan engagement and put Sacramento back on the map, Ranadivé assembled a plan that would get the Kings back on their feet.</p>\n<p>Pairing up with the City Council of Sacramento, an approved vote helped set forth the $507 million dollar deal for the Golden One Center. Set to open just in time for the upcoming NBA season this October, this fresh arena will surely energize a city that has been deprived of winning basketball.</p>\n<p>At 779,000 square feet, up to 19,000 in seating and located in the heart of downtown Sacramento, the Golden One Center acts as an ideal and enticing venue for excitement, culture and live entertainment.</p>\n<p>Ranadivé has also caught the attention of more renowned sports organizations with this newly implemented arena.</p>\n<p>The California Interscholastic Federation and the NCAA have both agreed to make the Golden One Center home of the CIF State Basketball Championships as well as the first two rounds of the NCAA Men’s Division I Tournament.</p>\n<p>With a prime location, a host to iconic sporting events and state-of-the-art facilities that ensure optimum levels of enjoyment, the Golden One Center will not only rejuvenate this urban metropolitan area but also its loyal Kings’ fans.</p>\n<p>While the city of Cleveland seeks its first NBA championship and the Warriors look to neatly wrap up an already historic season, the Kings also have their own goal in mind of rekindling a winning culture.</p>\n<p>Still nostalgic from the early 2000s and in search of a new identity, the Golden One Center will offer the fresh start this NBA franchise eagerly needs. Coming early October, history will be made and the city of Sacramento will embark on a “New Era of Proud.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 5, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"66614\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/flip-minnesotas-hometown-hero/around-the-nba/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=720%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"720,150\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"around the nba\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=250%2C52&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=720%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-66614 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?resize=888%2C185\" alt=\"around the nba\" width=\"888\" height=\"185\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?resize=250%2C52&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70652\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/change-in-home-signals-kings-return-to-throne/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70652\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/change-in-home-signals-kings-return-to-throne/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/change-in-home-signals-kings-return-to-throne/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/change-in-home-signals-kings-return-to-throne/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/change-in-home-signals-kings-return-to-throne/","id":1959,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1958,1957,1956],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
