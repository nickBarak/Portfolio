Bike shop. The total cost of the project and sources of funding are still undetermined. Irene Chen / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“I think this project is transformational in its scope,” said Mark Nocciolo, director of capital development at UC Santa Barbara. Nocciolo has overseen early renovation plans and worked with the architect and Associated Students (A.S.) to help visualize the project.</p>\n<p>“The intent is to try to redefine the University Center to be less like a mall and more like a student union. Anybody who has been to any Division 1 campus would recognize that there’s usually a university center that’s more student-oriented than ours is,” he explained.</p>\n<p>The model was developed by Nocciolo and Jean Gaff, managing principal of Pfeiffer Architects.</p>\n<p>The plans radically change and “revitalize” the University Center (UCen) into a “NewCen,” according to A.S. President Hieu Le.</p>\n<p>“Today’s Student Affairs’ (S.A.) service needs substantially exceed the capacity of S.A. facilities, compromising functionality, collaborations and staff and student well-being,” Le said.</p>\n<p>The renovated UCen would include a new “innovation lab” where students could collaborate on projects, a “demonstration kitchen” in which chefs would offer cooking lessons and connectivity kiosks, in which students tabling for their organizations would have a space to set up shop.</p>\n<p>These features are in addition to elements previously described on the project’s ballot measure, such as expanded space for the A.S. Food Bank, Campus Learning and Assistive Services (CLAS) and Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.).</p>\n<p>The 3D model additionally projects an expanded Wellness Center, which currently exists inside Student Health. As <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/stagnant-2-million-fund-could-offset-ucen-project-costs-fees-will-still-rise-after-inflation/\">previously reported</a>, the building would also include a migrated A.S. Bike Shop.</p>\n<p>The project would also include a new “pedestrian zone” adjacent to the building, which would allow more space for people walking through on campus tours.</p>\n<p>Several areas of the current UCen, such as the bookstore, Starbucks and some of the food areas, will remain in business throughout construction, Le said.</p>\n<p>Since the project was first proposed, students have disputed how much it would <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/\">actually cost</a>, while information about the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/broken-outdated-pipes-to-blame-for-ucen-smell/\">state of the current UCen</a> and Le’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/petition/\">petitioning methods</a> have been controversial topics across the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>If students vote to pass the project, student fees will be increased $20.40 per quarter from Fall 2018 until Fall 2022. From Fall 2022 to Fall 2052, students will pay an additional $96.06 per quarter.</p>\n<p>Funding for the project will come from a combination of alumni donations, student fees and the university itself, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“At this current state we don’t know [exactly how much people will pay] because there are a lot of factors, such as donations,” he said.</p>\n<p>This is the third time an A.S. president has created a UCen renovation plan. During the 2013-14 school year, then-President Jonathan Abboud developed a similar plan that would have expanded space in the UCen to allocate more space to campus services. The plan failed on the spring ballot.</p>\n<p>Another failed UCen renovation, proposed in 2011, would have expanded third-floor study space. In 2012, then-President Harrison Weber created a plan for an entirely new building, a Student Engagement Center. Students voted down the fee initiative in the spring election.</p>\n<p>While the organization of different spaces has varied in the different UCen plans, the concept has remained fairly consistent, Nocciolo said.</p>\n<p>He noted that the latest renovation project differs from the previous ones because it addresses infrastructural problems that are reportedly plaguing the facility.</p>\n<p>Students will vote on this project in April 23-26. If it passes, planning likely will begin immediately, according to Le.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the April 12, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Lu spent much of his time volunteering, including through beach clean-ups and music lessons in the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An avid musician, Lu played the french horn in the Woodbridge High School marching band in Irvine, California. Lu also liked to play piano, baseball and work out with friends, often motivating them to exercise harder. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alyssa Sanjongio became friends with Lu when the two played the french horn in their middle and high school band. Friends would often call Lu the “ride guy” because he was always willing to give someone a ride in his car if they needed to go somewhere. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanjongio described Lu as “iconic” and well-liked, reflecting on when Lu was crowned king of the Winter Formal and the multiple times Lu would fall asleep in class in high school.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She says that Lu’s death has brought many of their high school friends together in a way only Lu could.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though it’s really horrible, it’s still like this new sense of connection and strength among all the people that he touched in his life, which is really amazing,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of Lu’s friends from high school, including Sanjongio, also attended UCSB. Nathan Ng, a high school and college friend, echoed Sanjongio’s sentiments about Lu, adding that Lu approached everyone with a kindness and humility that is hard to find.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He went out of his way to help people, whether it was people in his normal social group or just people in general. He was very open to seeing how everyone was doing and I greatly respect that,” Ng said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lu was a present and constant part of his friends’ lives, said Eric Kim, a longtime friend of Lu’s and one of his roommates in Santa Cruz Residence Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve known him for a long time, [and] I always expect his presence,” Kim said. “I’ve gotten used to him.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lu was also enjoying his time at UCSB, Kim said, adding that Lu was excited to attend the university last summer.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It exceeded expectations when he got here, he was really having a good time, even when he had a lot of work or classes,” Kim said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malcolm Tsay met Lu in middle school and said Lu was “like a brother” to him.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He was just the most helpful person ever,” Tsay said. “He always put other people first. You could talk to him about anything [and] he opened up his heart to everyone.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tsay set up a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/7u33cn-james-lus-funeral-fund\">GoFundMe</a> for Lu’s funeral and has raised over $13,000 so far. He said he wanted to give something back to Lu and help out his family.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lu was a leader, Tsay said, and someone he could look to for guidance, whether it be for music or life advice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This year, I’m drum major of the marching band, and I wouldn’t have those leadership skills without the interactions I’ve shared with James and the advice he’s given me throughout the years,” Tsay said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another band friend, Aziz Hamza, said he continued to stay in contact with Lu at UCSB to see how he was adjusting to college life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hamza described Lu as dedicated and having a “relaxed presence.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He’d always be laughing, like, whatever conversation he would be having, it would be something humorous,” Hamza said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of Lu’s friends noted that Lu was on his way to teach piano to children on the day he died. They said it was a testament to Lu’s selflessness and generosity.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That just sums up his intentions in life. He wanted to help people he wanted to make a difference in the world,” Ng said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“‘Till the very end, he was helping others and using his ability and helping teach other people,” Kim added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ng said he wants Lu to be remembered as someone who always encouraged others to try their best and put their needs before his own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He opened my eyes to being optimistic in this world and doing your best,” Ng said. “Going through this grief of losing him, I’m getting stronger everyday, and I always feel like he’s still watching me. He’s the kind of person you should want to model yourself after.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lu’s funeral will be held at Pacific View Memorial Park in Corona Del Mar on Sunday, March 18, at 2 p.m. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

The gestational time limit changed from 49 days to 70 days, according to the report by the FDA that was published on March 29, 2016.</p>\n<p>In accordance with the new label, the drug can also be administered by a health care provider rather than a physician, which the old label required. Post-treatment includes an assessment of the patient 7-14 days after the drug is taken, rather than a formal examination conducted by a physician, according to an article published by the <a href=\"http://www.pharmacytimes.com/contributor/sally-rafie-pharmd/2016/04/abortion-pill-label-change-what-pharmacists-need-to-know\">Pharmacy Times.</a></p>\n<p>The waiting period to take Misoprostol, the medication taken after Mireprex, changed from 72 hours to 24-48 hours. The dosage of Misoprostol was also changed from 2 tablets (400 mcg) to 4 tablets (800 mcg).</p>\n<p>“[People] argued that the FDA were missing instances [in their review of the drug] where patients might have died because they were not using one of the [proper] monitoring systems that monitor the safety of drugs,” Crosse said.</p>\n<p>The Sentinel System is the monitoring system used by the FDA to determine the safety of medicine by analyzing health information made available by physicians online, according to the FDA website.</p>\n<p>After an investigation of the FDA’s approval of changes, the GAO found that the attacks by the critics against the proper use of the Sentinel System were invalid because the Sentinel System applies only to drugs distributed through pharmacies.</p>\n<p>“MifePrex is not distributed through pharmacies so information on it would not be available in the Sentinel System to allow it to track safety concerns,” Crosse said.</p>\n<p>Mifeprex does have another mechanism to track its safety concerns, and Crosse confirmed that Mifeprex has a low rate of serious medical events that occurred as a result of women taking the drug.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the April 5 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: An original version of this article stated that SB 320 will allow all public universities to provide the abortion pill.
