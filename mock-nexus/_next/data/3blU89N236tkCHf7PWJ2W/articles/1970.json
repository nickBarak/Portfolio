Others may choose to take advantage of that extra year to work on their skills so that they may gain more playing time in their sport for the upcoming season.</p>\n<p>Yet neither of these reasons apply to senior center Lauren Martin of the UCSB women’s water polo team.</p>\n<p>The Clovis West High School graduate joined the Gaucho family after a very successful high school career in which she earned seven varsity letters both in water polo as well as swimming. She is a two-time All-American, collecting First Team honors as a senior and Fourth Team accolades as a junior.</p>\n<p>Martin was also an All-CIF Central Section selection twice and earned All-Tri River Athletic Conference distinction two times as well. Martin led her team to three consecutive Tri River Athletic Conference titles and individually won consecutive CIF championships in 2008 and 2009.</p>\n<p>It was no surprise that after all of those merits, the freshman went on to play in all 35 games in her first season, generating 29 goals and 13 assists and finishing the season with an impressive shooting percentage of .392. Martin also led the team in earned penalties and ejections with a high count of 47 that year. The two following years were as productive as the first, contributing 24 and 33 goals her sophomore and junior season, respectively.</p>\n<p>Playing time was not a problem for Lauren who had certainly earned her spot as the team’s center player; however, coming into her fourth season she decided to take a year off.</p>\n<p>“The reason why I redshirted last year is because I had certain goals for myself and I felt that I would meet those goals if I took off a year and just trained,” Martin said. “We had a new coach and I wanted to try and figure out her coaching style and also because our team was very young.”</p>\n<p>Train she did, and it certainly paid off. Although players continue to assist practice and play against their own teammates, not participating in games against outside competitors can deteriorate some athletes’ skills.</p>\n<p>Yet, this was not the case when it came to Martin.</p>\n<p>Right from the start of this season, her presence made such a significant impact on the team. In her first game back against Cal, she put away four goals alone, proving that she had been waiting to be back in the pool with her teammates for a very long time and seemed determined to make the most of her senior campaign.</p>\n<p>“She’s been sitting for over a year waiting to play,” Head Coach Serela Kay mentioned in an interview earlier this year. “She’s excited, and we’re excited to have her back in the paint to fill that role and she’s doing great.”</p>\n<p>Even after her outstanding performance that weekend, it remained unpredictable just how “great” she would continue to do throughout the season and how much of an influence she would have on the team.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t really have the mindset of ‘Oh I hope I do well,’” Marin said. “It was just what was expected, out of the whole entire team, even, not just myself.”</p>\n<p>The 5’10” center finished her last season with UCSB as the team’s leading scorer with 45 goals and a striking shooting percentage of .517, feats that helped her to earn Big West Player of the Week honors twice this season.</p>\n<p>However, the importance of her contributions to the team were not only in the amount of goals that she would put away each game, but also in their timing.</p>\n<p>On several occasions, Martin came in clutch when the team needed her the most. She had a couple of game-winners, some occurring in overtime, which would give the Gauchos the victory in addition to being a catalyst that occasionally sparked the team when it needed to recoup in dire situations.</p>\n<p>“Whenever I go in the game, it is my job to get a goal or set a teammate up with a really nice pass or earn an ejection so that someone else can score,” Martin said modestly. “My mindset going is to give 110 percent every time I go in the water.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the senior might attribute some of her collegiate success both in and out of the pool to her earlier years when she participated in the Olympic Development Program.</p>\n<p>The program’s purpose is develop players that will represent USA Water Polo throughout domestic and international competition. With such high expectations and the effort that is required of all athletes, the experience was beneficial beyond the depths of the pool, helping individuals improve as everyday people.</p>\n<p>“It showed me commitment, and just going into those practices knowing that you have eight hours of practice ahead, but knowing that it will all pay off in the long run teaches you determination,” Martin said. “It also helped with time management, knowing that I had a long practice ahead and I had to plan for school and other stuff I had to do.”</p>\n<p>While her career at UCSB might be over after the Big West Tournament, Martin hopes to continue doing what she loves in the future. While nothing is set in stone yet, word has it that this powerful player will be taking her talents overseas.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 28, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70437\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-risky-plunge-rewarded/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70437\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-risky-plunge-rewarded/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-risky-plunge-rewarded/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-risky-plunge-rewarded/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/a-risky-plunge-rewarded/","id":1970,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[1969,1968,1967],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon","biography":"Not available","articles":[1970,4969,4970,4971,4987,4989,4994,4997,5007,5010,5011,5012,5014,5453,5454,5455,5457,5458,5459,5471,5477],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gov.

Without them, today would not have been a reality.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill allocates $200,000 to each UC and CSU campus student health center to cover the costs of providing abortion medication, including “Facility and security upgrades,” “Costs associated with training staff in the provision of abortion by medication techniques” and “Staff cost reimbursement and clinical revenue offset while staff are in trainings.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An additional $200,000 each will be allocated to the UC and CSU systems to pay for “24-hour, backup medical support by telephone to patients who have obtained abortion by medication techniques at a public university student health center,” among other training and budgeting costs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC student health centers currently provide students with access to comprehensive reproductive health services, and this new law will further access to medication abortion by providing these services on-site,” Sarah McBride, spokesperson for the UC said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McBride added that the system “is currently evaluating next steps and will implement the law accordingly.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily Montalvo-Telford ‘19, who lobbied for SB 24’s passing and was present this morning when Newsom signed the bill into law, said the passing of the law made her feel “safe.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It can be very scary and stressful to know that your basic rights are always up for debate, especially what we’ve been seeing at the federal level, but right now I feel good and I feel safe because I know California is leading the fight for reproductive justice and my rights are upheld right now,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, Montalvo-Telford served as president of Students Against Sexual Assault last year and worked with justCARE: Campus Action for Reproductive Equity, a statewide organization that advocates for abortion pills on college campuses, and UCSB’s Students for Reproductive Justice, to advocate for the bill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year political science major Philippa Villalobos, current director for Students for Reproductive Justice, said that in addition to the organization’s work on campus, which included phone banking and tabling, they made multiple trips to Sacramento and testified at Senate and Assembly meetings in support of the bill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Villalobos denounced Brown’s decision to veto the initial bill, explaining that “even if it were five miles, as students, it’s really difficult to get off campus.” In addition to having to potentially miss class multiple times and depend on often unreliable public transportation, Villalobos added that off-campus clinics can often have long wait times as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Aside from the physical barriers and financial barriers, a big issue too is the lack of community and discussion about pregnancy on campus,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And so by bringing this onto campus, you’re offering students a safe way to access abortion and have a conversation and not feel so alone.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and quickly washed away </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on a sidewalk adjacent to fraternity Sigma Pi. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an effort to fill in the gaps, students jumped to social media and ignited a firestorm of posts that called for the university to play a more transparent role in informing the student body </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">beyond sharing a list of “safety tips” attached to the bottom of the timely warning. Others began pointing fingers at specific fraternities on Twitter; although unconfirmed, some tweets went viral. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A timely warning from the university is a product of deliberation and consideration, according to Miles Ashlock, associate dean and director of the Office of Student Life (OSL). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university elicits a timely warning on a “case-by-case basis” based on factors surrounding the incident, which include “the nature of the crime, the serious or continuing threat to the campus community, and the possible risk of compromising law enforcement efforts,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to release the timely warning with undisclosed information stems from the Clery Act, a campus security law that aims to facilitate transparency in campus crimes and statistics, according to the Clery Act’s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://clerycenter.org&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1571898031086000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHySLJ3MlOIp8a4Zzggc0tQ8AZzXw\">website</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, student leaders in registered campus organizations, such as a fraternities or sororities, are not mandated to report instances of sexual violence and sexual harassment and instead attend annual trainings “in interpersonal violence prevention strategies,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a crime occurs on “Clery geography,” which, according to the Clery Act’s website, includes non-campus buildings “owned or controlled by a student organization,” the university makes a judgment call to “evaluate if there is a serious or ongoing threat to the campus community,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In our communications, we strive to be sensitive to the impact that the message may have on survivors and to be careful not to create the potentially false sense of security (by naming one location over another, particularly when we may not have sufficient information to like the offense to a particular residence),” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Associated Students President Alison Sir said she met with campus administrators following the release of the timely warning out of concern for survivors and those unaffiliated with Greek life who feel “uncomfortable” about the situation. In a meeting with Assistant Vice Chancellor &amp; Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn, Sir said she learned the timely warning was not specific to one fraternity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The timely warning is about multiple IFC frats and frats outside [of IFC] — like in [multi-cultural] groups. [The university] didn’t want to release the names because I know a lot of students are angry about that because they’re all under investigation,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir also addressed the “victim-blaming” nature of the timely warning’s “safety tips,” which she said the university opted to include after learning of one allegation that claimed a fraternity had laced a bottle marked with an “X” on it and would choose “who would get [the bottle] or not.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was basically IFC frats and frats outside of IFC as well, nothing was finalized [and] they were still investigating, so they didn’t want to release any names of people involved.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Wednesday’s Senate meeting, Sir addressed Senate regarding the timely warning. She said she is working with Klawunn and Armistead to develop a “task force” of administration members, community leaders and students to review policies and practices addressing sexual violence in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir told senators that the task force will “encourage safer behavior and develop better response practices.” At this time, Sir was unsure who would be appointed to the task force, but said she will ensure that every “stakeholder” in the issue would be involved in the task force. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When further questioned by Senator Benjamin Chocron, Sir added that these stakeholders include IFC and Panhellenic members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir also advertised an upcoming Sexual Assault Town Hall, hosted by Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) – to be held on Nov. 14 at 6 p.m. in Corwin Pavilion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The news brought by the timely warning drew an immediate response of “abhorrence and disgust” in the eyes of SASA’s president, Alia Reynolds, a third-year global studies and philosophy double major. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We condemn any and all individuals or organizations which knowingly allow such actions to take place, or foster an environment which allows individuals to feel they can take such actions,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many students who spoke up on social media, Reynolds concluded that the university’s response was “not adequate” and that “[SASA] firmly advocate[s] for the university to release the name of the fraternity organization[s] associated with the incident.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds said SASA has created a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sasa-ca.org/index.php/svsh-map/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1571899623049000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE3PY3zJdSKCobVCHpizGDfPV5mTg\">“Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Map”</a> which allows survivors to “anonymously submit the date, location and any details they wish to disclose about an instance” of sexual violence or sexual harassment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The frequency of incidents similar to those described by the timely warning call for “a larger conversation regarding the prevalent cultural and social context within Isla Vista and many other communities,” Reynolds said. “We believe a larger cultural shift in accountability </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">must take place within our community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday, a message responding to the timely warning was chalked </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and quickly washed away </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on a sidewalk adjacent to fraternity Sigma Pi, emboldened with the words “hold frats accountable.” The chalking belonged to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.instagram.com/catcallsofsantabarbara/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1571899698047000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFNB-6PuIpmW2S0nHEJL271ArepsA\">@catcallsofsantabarbara</a>, an Instagram account that posts anonymously submitted stories of sexual harassment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two representatives of the account, who wish to remain anonym</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ous to avoid retaliation, told the Nexus they first heard about the timely warning after receiving multiple screenshots of the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After speaking with a “few members of the Greek community,” one representative of the account said they were under the impression that Sigma Pi was the fraternity mentioned in the timely warning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two days after making a post about an incident at Sigma Pi, the representatives received information that contradicted their original beliefs regarding the fraternity, subsequently leading them to retract any posts implicating the fraternity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The conflicting information, which came from a “very credible source,” made it clear to the representatives that the situation ran “a lot deeper than we expected” and was not limited to one specific fraternity, the two stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Sunday, the Instagram account announced a “boycott” against Sigma Pi, where they planned to march from Sea Lookout Park to the Sigma Pi house, but the march was cancelled “to give time for the victims to heal,” a post on the account’s page read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many on social media, Spencer Brandt, board president for the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), said he was “horrified” by the timely warning and supports students’ calls for the university “to name the fraternit[ies]” where the incidents occurred.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD is partnering with Standing Together to End Sexual Assault, an organization dedicated to providing counseling and support services to survivors of sexual assault, Brandt added. The </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/csd-finalizes-contract-with-ucpd-for-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interpersonal violence investigator program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a collaboration with the UC Police Department and I.V. CSD, has been in place since 2018 to investigate cases relating to sexual violence, according to Brandt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The truth is that no one deserves to be made into a survivor. We all need to take a hard look at the I.V. culture and ask ourselves what about it enables so much sexual violence.” </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evelyn Spence and Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><i>Correction [Oct. 24, 1:26 a.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that President Alison Sir partnered with SASA for the Survivor Town Hall.

An Internal Affairs investigation has since been opened into Hashimoto’s actions, as stated in court on Wednesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of the cases will remain stalled in the Santa Barbara County Superior Court while the plaintiffs attempt internal mediation with the university.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
