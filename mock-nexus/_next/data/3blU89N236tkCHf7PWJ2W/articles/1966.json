It’s still up, but it’s fallen into disuse and nobody posts on it,” Kennedy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I stopped checking because there was no activity on it. But then I think it was during Thomas Fire, one of my students mentioned to me, ‘Hey, Professor Kennedy, you’ve got to check out the [new] meme page because the memes people are making about the fire are hysterical,’” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to jokes of his own, Kennedy blends in well with the student-generated memes around him, posting pictures of slumped-over trees and punny captions to appease viewers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up until recently, Kennedy says most of his activity on the “Zesty Meme Cuisine for Horny Teens” meme page has been spent “lurking,” or scrolling through the page without posting. But he actively posts on a linguistics meme page he maintains himself, which he said is chock-full of “really niche humor.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Those [linguistics] jokes are lost on just about everybody,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Kennedy said the jokes that don’t work serve to teach him about the ones that do. After teaching at UCSB for over 15 years, Kennedy has had ample time to hone his craft. He’ll opt to inject “a little bit of playful humor” while teaching a class, which oftentimes helps him make a point or lighten the mood. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If I have humor in class, it’s either self-deprecating or it makes fun of people in power.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But memes, on the other hand, serve a different purpose. Kennedy finds that the nature of memes — “a quick joke” — enables people to laugh at “content that everyone can get right away.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it doesn’t need to be explained, then people are gonna respond well,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s not to forget about the downsides of meme culture, such as the potential for a “destructive” or “nasty” message — which Kennedy said is generally the result of cracking a joke intended to be funny but ends up offensive in its delivery. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Another thing that comes up, especially in the teaching context, is where we confront humor that’s hurtful. And so in some of my classes, I do this: I’ll say, ‘Look, here’s the point of view that someone had tried to make with a joke and it’s offensive and their defense is going to be, ‘Well, come on, I’m just trying to be funny,’” Kennedy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s never an appropriate response to defend a joke that’s been hurtful to someone else,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid this, however, Kennedy suggests that anyone looking to crack a joke should bear in mind their own identity as to not “punch down” with their humor, or make a joke that pushes the boundaries on one’s identity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kennedy defines himself as a “straight, white middle-aged person,” which means “the only people I can tell jokes about are people who think they’re smarter than they are, people who are wealthy or people who are older than myself,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He made note of comedy’s magnitude in the academic world, some of which has spilled into classrooms at UCSB with Linguistics 135, a course dedicated to memes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have a colleague in my department who teaches a class on memes and it’s a deep dive into theories of what it is that people are tapping into when they make [memes],” Kennedy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s scholars who study the structure of humor and joke templates and everything else like that. And the nature of how humor plays a role in conversational interactions,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although a linguist by trade, Kennedy said he uses comedy to not only make students laugh, but to also use memes’ shared “overlapping” sense of humor to better understand social practices used among college students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The student perspective] is valuable to me,” which opens doors to a culture that “people my age ought to be more aware of than pretend like we’re annoyed by it or anything else like that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So next time a funny meme floats across your screen — look twice — it may be your professor. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Although the program was just unveiled at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2019, Parison said a couple of students have already come in to declare the minor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She noted that the new minor is not exclusive to art history courses; it includes opportunities to take courses within both the geography and environmental studies majors. Both of the aforementioned disciplines offer classes that can be used to fill requirements of the minor, including the geography department’s series on urban or regional planning and the environmental department’s series on sustainable communities, according to Parison.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She clarified that the minor would not solely focus on the classical world, but the architecture of multiple styles and time periods as well.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parison has already noticed an interest in the minor across a variety of academic fields, including </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (S.T.E.M.)</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">majors that usually wouldn’t express interest in art history given the demands of their coursework.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve had a lot of interest from engineering students in the past who want to be involved but can’t double major in two colleges but can do the minor relatively easy. It gives them a way to participate and we’ve received lots of support from the engineering departments and advisors,” Parison said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parison advises students to meet with her before taking on the minor to determine if it will fulfill their needs and interests, or even if the major may potentially be suited for them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are not a university that explicitly prepares students to be an architect and this minor is not the best way to qualify for architecture school.

The other three projects are registering students to vote, educating faculty on alternatives to expensive textbooks and trying to convert the entire UC system to using 100% renewable energy by 2050.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At last count on Wednesday, the petition to eliminate single-use plastics on UCSB’s campus had 461 signatures, nearly a thousand short of the 1,400 signatures CALPIRG hopes to acquire before the quarter ends and a sliver of the 25,976 students currently enrolled at UCSB.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The single-use plastics ban would eliminate items such as straws, utensils and plastic foam take-out boxes distributed by on-campus restaurants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CALPIRG decided on a petition to ban single-use plastics in order to demonstrate widespread student support for the policy to leaders such as UCSB’s Chancellor Henry Yang or University of California President Janet Napolitano, according to Michels.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The UCs are doing a lot for sustainability, but we think we can do more,” CALPIRG’s Organizing Director Kat Lockwood said. “It would make them a world leader [to ban single-use plastics].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC system is already looking into ways to eliminate single-use plastics on campuses by turning to cities with laws minimizing single-use plastics as a model, UC Office of the President (UCOP) Senior Communications Strategist Stett Holbrook said in an email. Berkeley is one such city, which passed a plastic foodware reduction policy in January earlier this year. The UCOP website states that the UCs will ban expanded polystyrene, commonly found in plastic foam take-out containers, by 2020. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC system’s Zero Waste 2020 initiative aims to “divert 90 percent of waste from landfills to recycling and composting facilities, not to eliminate waste by 2020,” Holbrook added. However, the UC system currently measured a 69% diversion rate from 2017-18, according to the 2018 Annual Report on Sustainable Practices, with only three months remaining until 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report also shows that the UC’s diversion rates have hovered in the high-60 and low-70 percentage points since 2017. Holbrook said the UC’s slowed diversion rates are due to “various internal and external barriers, including turmoil in the international recycling markets and the limitations of local waste haulers.” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond eliminating single-use plastics, the UCSB CALPIRG chapter has been working on a project to inform professors about open-source educational resources, or OERs, in an effort to shift professors away from expensive textbooks. When the chapter began the campaign last year, 62 faculty or administration members signed on to show support for it, according to Michels.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve had a lot of students come up to our textbook tables and tell us things that they’ve had to give up,” Jennifer Manning, fourth-year student and CALPIRG board member, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One student said that her dad had to give up their family car in order to be able to afford to pay for her textbooks for that quarter. So we want to avoid people having to deal with struggles that are unnecessary when they have to purchase, like a $200 textbook, because their professor wanted the newest edition.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Manning and Michel said they were considering pushing for textbook prices to be included on G.O.L.D. when students sign up for classes but were still undecided on whether or not to pursue that initiative.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB CALPIRG campaign to get the UCs to run on purely renewable energy is also through a petition, run in the same style as the one banning single-use plastics. Its focus is the heating and cooling units for many on-campus buildings, in addition to the emissions from campus-owned vehicles, according to Manning. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CALPIRG typically works to sign up college students to vote, but this year, the UCSB chapter will pressure the student government to draft a resolution favoring a voting center on campus that allows </span><a href=\"https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/conditional-voter-reg/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">same-day registration</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is only typically allowed at county elections offices and certain designated satellite locations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite her faith that the UCSB community’s values align with CALPIRG’s, Michels admitted that right now, students primarily know them as nuisances with clipboards in the Arbor.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think a lot of it is just a misconception of what we do,” Manning said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They just assume that we’re just this annoying group that wants your signature and wants your money without actually understanding the dynamic of how the group actually operates.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a CALPIRG volunteer approaches someone to ask for their signature, their goal goes beyond drawing support for a petition. It’s also to get contact information, pledge money and possibly a new volunteer, according to Michels.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we find someone that’s interested enough to sign that petition, we’ll ask them to come to another event, so we kind of just exponentially increase the amount of work we can do,” Michels said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each CALPIRG chapter needs to meet a quota of 10-15% of the student body to donate $10 a quarter. The UCSB chapter has never had an issue meeting that number, according to Manning.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it is not one of their immediate projects, Lockwood said CALPIRG’s board is interested in implementing their quarterly fee as an official UC campus cost across the system. Michel said that the overall cost per student would be cheaper than the current $10 fee if they implement this change but did not have a new number representing what each student would pay. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We wouldn’t have to pester you for money because we wouldn’t have to do our pledge drive,” Manning said. “You want CALPIRG to stop bothering you on the Arbor? Then vote to upgrade our funding.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Oct. 3, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em> print edition. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90111\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/calpirg-discusses-latest-projects-plans-for-upcoming-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90111\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/calpirg-discusses-latest-projects-plans-for-upcoming-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/calpirg-discusses-latest-projects-plans-for-upcoming-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/calpirg-discusses-latest-projects-plans-for-upcoming-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/calpirg-discusses-latest-projects-plans-for-upcoming-year/","id":1963,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[1962,1961,1960],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
