The problems start with the quarterback, where Blaine Gabbert and Chad Henne have been the two worst in the league for years. A “face-of-the-franchise” signal-caller like Bridgewater will be the centerpiece of the rebuilding effort. In a draft with the deepest class of QB’s in recent memory, Bridgewater stands above the rest. Although he doesn’t have any skills that are considered elite, his intelligence, decision-making, strength, accurate arm and athleticism combine for an immediate NFL starter.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers — Jadeveon Clowney, DE, South Carolina</p>\n<p>The Bucs had high hopes entering the season, but injuries decimated the skill positions on offense, and quarterback Josh Freeman did not have the bounce-back season many had hoped for. Instead, Freeman is now a benchwarmer for the Minnesota Vikings, leaving Vincent Jackson and Mike Glennon as the only notable players on a porous offense. The defense is actually alright, especially against the run. Clowney is far and away the best player in the draft, and the only way he doesn’t go to the Bucs here is via a trade. An elite pass rusher is the only missing ingredient from this defense and would be exactly what Tampa Bay needs to get back to their smash-mouth, physical style that took them to the Super Bowl over a decade ago.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Minnesota Vikings — Marcus Mariota, QB, Oregon</p>\n<p>The signing of Josh Freeman signifies the end of the Christian Ponder era in Minnesota. However, after Freeman’s cringe-worthy debut for the Purple People Eaters, it is clear that their franchise QB is not on this roster at the moment. Enter Mariota. The redshirt sophomore phenom is skyrocketing up draft boards and is now being ranked even higher than Teddy Bridgewater. Mariota’s 95.5 Total Quarterback Rating is tops in the nation and better than all of the last four Heisman-winning quarterbacks. He has elite athleticism comparable to Robert Griffin III, and this season he has added the ability to throw deep passes down the sidelines. Bridgewater is considered more of a sure thing, and thus more likely to go number one. But Mariota has the highest upside of any offensive player in the draft and has a chance to leapfrog into the number one spot.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>New York Giants — Jake Matthews, OT, Texas A&amp;M</p>\n<p>Through the first six games of the season, New York was historically awful, even giving the Jaguars a run for their money as worst in the league. They seemed to have turned it around a bit, although their only two wins have come against a demoralized Vikings team and a beat-up Eagles team. Their point differential and unbalanced team composition are the makeup for a terrible team, and they need to add some great role players to contend next year. A franchise left tackle like Matthews would help protect Eli Manning, restore the capacity to utilize Victor Cruz and Hakeem Nicks and rejuvenate the worst running game in football. A playmaker on defense is also a possibility, but I expect NY to look to improve an offense that earlier in the season got shut out by the Carolina Panthers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Houston Texans — Sammy Watkins, WR, Clemson</p>\n<p>This would be the pick if the season ended today and no trades were made, but I don’t expect it to actually shape up this way. Houston needs a quarterback, but with Mariota and Bridgewater off the board, there is no player worthy of a top five pick. I expect Houston to trade down and go after someone like Brett Hundley, Tajh Boyd or Johnny Manziel. However, all this considered, Watkins would be a solid pick for the Texans here. An explosive playmaker on offense, Watkins has the potential of an elite number one to take the place of the slowing Andre Johnson. He does incredible things after the catch and is showing the technical ability to be a reliable, go-to threat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 29th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Vicky Kohatsu of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52660\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-jaguars-grab-teddy-bridgewater-first/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52660\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-jaguars-grab-teddy-bridgewater-first/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-jaguars-grab-teddy-bridgewater-first/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-jaguars-grab-teddy-bridgewater-first/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-29/the-projected-top-five-picks-of-the-nfl-draft-jaguars-grab-teddy-bridgewater-first/","id":2086,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[2085,2084,2083],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco","biography":"Not available","articles":[597,2058,2084,2086,3196,3224,3228,3235,3239,3240,3242,3245,3250,3251,5105,5107,5108],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Second Instance of Anti-Semitism Reported Within the Same Week","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-04-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Facts-UCSB-Campus-by-Olivia-Consterdine-PRINT-2-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Facts-UCSB-Campus-by-Olivia-Consterdine-PRINT-2-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The statement expressed a need for change through a demand for “Nazi symbols” to be considered a terrorist act.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several sociology, political science, global studies and environmental studies graduate students at UC Santa Barbara released a statement on April 4 regarding an incident of anti-Semitism that took place two days prior, labeling the incident as a “terrorist act.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement alleges that on the morning of April 2, a man was seen walking “the hallways of the UCSB Sociology department wearing a ‘Waffen SS’ (Nazi death squad) t-shirt.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Law enforcement was contacted immediately after the individual was seen by a graduate student who reported the individual walking through the building, according to the statement.

Senate released a formal statement regarding the flyers, denouncing it as “extremely derogatory” and “obscenely misrepresentative of Jewish people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We call upon the UCSB student body to actively stand in solidarity with our Jewish community by spreading awareness and education about anti-Semitism, and to quickly report any concering behavior,” the A.S. statement read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB graduate students echoed the sentiments of the statement published by A.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The graduate students’ statement encouraged “immediate preventative action,” labeling such incidents as part of “an ever-growing tide of terrorist threats against students, staff, and faculty both here and at campuses across the United States.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement expressed a need for change through a demand for “Nazi symbols” to be considered a terrorist act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We insist that campus and union officials publicly recognize that the act of (uncritically) displaying Nazi symbols is a terrorist act,” the statement added. “Posting violent threats to Jews is racial terrorism that must not be tolerated anywhere, including our campus community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement acknowledged that campus security and department personnel have previously told students to report any “potentially threatening behaviors,” but noted that “there has yet to be any wide announcement to the campus community of the calculated dissemination of Nazi materials or of the sighting of Nazi apparel on campus.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the statement justified its call for action, claiming that “such a warning and a call for action is necessary not only because students, staff, and faculty already vulnerable to violence have a right to know about potential threats… but more so because it is a certainty that someone in the broader community knows the person or persons making these terrorist threats.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement said there should be an institutional response centered on the well being and safety of UCSB students and employees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An institutional response would have “the potential to prevent or at least minimize the severity of any future attack,” according to the statement. </span></p>\n<p>The statement in full can be viewed below:</p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Grad-Letter-to-UCSB-Officials-2.7.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Grad-Letter-to-UCSB-Officials-2.7.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

QLess aims to streamline this process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We see a real surge typically after lunch. I know it’s a challenge to get up in the morning early, but if you want to see advising on a drop-in basis, mornings are great.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This program is available for general and honors advising located at 1117 Cheadle Hall, pre-health admission advising located at 2105 North Hall and pre-law advising located at 2105 North Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopple noted that due to an unusually large freshman class this year, there is an increased demand in advising lines. He pointed out that the students coming to academic advising also have more nuanced academic backgrounds to work with.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Entering first-year students have more complex records when they get here. They have AP classes, a lot of them did IB, a lot more students are doing dual enrollment, we have more international students who have complicated records,” he said.  “So in order to figure out what they’ve done and what they need to do, there’s more advising necessary.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advising department has also greatly expanded in order to address that need in the last decade, he added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As recently as 10 years ago, there were maybe six or eight advisers for the whole college, and now, depending on some variables involving staff turnovers and leaves and things like that, we’re, like, 18, 22 [advisors]. We’ve grown a lot.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopple also said that he hopes there will be a transition away from physical paperwork to digital alternatives in terms of petitions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’d like to get rid of paper petitions. That’s obviously insane in the 21st century to be carrying pieces of paper around and standing in line, and that’s something we’re moving toward as well.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87475\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-15/qless-to-make-advising-more-accessible/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87475\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-15/qless-to-make-advising-more-accessible/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-15/qless-to-make-advising-more-accessible/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-15/qless-to-make-advising-more-accessible/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-15/qless-to-make-advising-more-accessible/","id":2085,"author":{"id":62,"name":"Emily Komessar"},"related":[2084,2083,2082],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Three Can’t Miss Predictions Entering the NBA Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/NBALogo.svg_.png?resize=197%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/NBALogo.svg_.png?resize=197%2C447&ssl=1","description":"LeBron and co. are ready for a three-peat.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I must be honest. As a Los Angeles Lakers diehard fan, I don’t remember a year where my enthusiasm for the impending NBA season was so low.

LeBron has firmly established his place as one of the greatest NBA players of all time, and he’s still in his prime at the age of 28. The only wings you could throw in the same sentence would be Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan. And even that’s an unfair comparison to James since he plays all five positions as well as anyone in history, including Magic Johnson. Nothing short of a devastating injury or Kevin Durant scoring 50 points a game will knock the King off his throne.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>The Los Angeles Lakers will miss the playoffs for the third time since 1976</strong></p>\n<p>This pains me to write, but even the most loyal Lakers fans see the writing on the wall. Last season’s seventh place finish was a complete disaster, and the team has been blown up with no significant improvements in the offseason. Dwight Howard abandoned ship after failing to live up to the hype while recovering from surgery. Now the hopes of the Lakers rest in the hands of Canada’s founding father Steve Nash, a pair of seven-foot cavemen [age and facial hair considered] in Pau Gasol and Chris Kaman, and a trigger happy journeyman wing referred to as “Swaggy P.” Shooting guard Nick Young fills the void left by Kobe Bryant and figures to be the Lakers’ leading scorer as long as Kobe is rehabbing. Of course, Kobe is the toughest athlete in the nation and could surprise everyone with an early triumphant return, and Pau is aging gracefully as a still effective starter. But the stars are aligned for the team in red that plays at Staples Center this year.</p>\n<p><strong>The 76ers will “win” the “waste for Wiggins” race</strong></p>\n<p>With the balance of power in the NBA extremely top-heavy for the last decade, teams realize that being awful and throwing a season in the hopes of landing the top pick in the draft is more advisable than dwelling in mediocrity for years and years. Just ask the Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors and Portland Trail Blazers, among others. The 76ers could be historically bad, with the Andrew Bynum experiment ending in failure and their best player Jrue Holiday being traded for a first round pick with a torn ACL. Nerlens Noel is out for the season, leaving Evan Turner as the only solid starter on the entire roster. Spencer Hawes has shown flashes of being a very productive player, but the team will still be awful even with those two playing their best basketball.</p>\n<p>We could see some great stories this season. The Cavaliers could return to contention, the Pacers will be better this year, and the return of Derrick Rose to the Bulls could give the Heat a run for their money. But at the top of the hierarchy, the song remains the same. Cheers to classic rock references.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 23, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of Wikipedia.org</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52587\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/three-cant-miss-predictions-entering-the-nba-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52587\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/three-cant-miss-predictions-entering-the-nba-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/three-cant-miss-predictions-entering-the-nba-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/three-cant-miss-predictions-entering-the-nba-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/three-cant-miss-predictions-entering-the-nba-season/","id":2084,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[2083,2082,2081],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
