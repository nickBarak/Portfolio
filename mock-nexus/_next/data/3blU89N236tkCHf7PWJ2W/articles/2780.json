Proxies are defined as temporary stand-ins for Senators unable attend Senate meetings who must be approved by the Board of Directors and are able to vote for the absent Senator, according to the A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p>“Senator proxies cannot be people that have declared their candidacy to run in any on-going elections,” Santos said. “I added in this highlighted piece that says Senator proxies cannot be current executives.”</p>\n<p>According to On-Campus Senator and second-year religious studies and philosophy double major Jennifer Liem, the Fraternity and Sorority Council changed their name to the Multicultural Greek Council, so Article VI of the A.S. Legal Code should be updated accordingly.</p>\n<p>“I think that we should also change the Fraternity Sorority Council, because I am on that council and we changed that name to Multicultural Greek Council,” Liem said.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and second-year history of public policy major Cassandra Mancini said the A.S. legal code should list the new Professional Greek Council as a Greek community alongside the Inter-Fraternity Council, Collegiate Panhellenic Council, National Panhellenic Council and the Multicultural Greek Council.</p>\n<p>“Apparently it is a new thing,” Mancini said. “They just started getting their stuff together.”</p>\n<p>Mancini said the bill to update media and publicity policy would link the official A.S. page to the A.S. Facebook page.</p>\n<p>“You can tag pages to A.S. UCSB and apparently we have a Wikipedia,” Mancini said. “Associated Students didn’t know that. I was going to add to the bill once I think about this for a little bit, how to have everyone have this community page about A.S. UCSB.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63108\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/a-s-discusses-legal-code-changes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63108\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/a-s-discusses-legal-code-changes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/a-s-discusses-legal-code-changes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/a-s-discusses-legal-code-changes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/a-s-discusses-legal-code-changes/","id":2780,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2779,2778,2777],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman","biography":"Not available","articles":[2407,2490,2504,2533,2541,2543,2544,2551,2557,2580,2616,2618,2688,2702,2703,2728,2737,2749,2778,2780,2792,2802,2803,2825,2846,2855,2860,2881,2885,2899,2900,2904,2908,2913,2920,2934,2943,2945,2946,2962,2970,2977,3443,3609,3617,3856,4590,4606,4626,4629,4656,4722,4741,4786,4801,4813],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Governance Board could potentially manage the Pardall Center if A.S. does not establish a special administration.</p>\n<p>“I would imagine that these future spaces would have somewhat of a different charge, and if they don’t, then maybe this existing committee could manage spaces with similar missions,” Moreh said.</p>\n<p>The committee tabled the bill to allow senators more time to become familiar with its language, according to Moreh.</p>\n<p>“It’s something that is pretty big since we are creating something, and I just wouldn’t want anyone to come and say, ‘I don’t feel as though there was enough time for senators to look at it,’” Moreh said. “We want to create something that is going to be a model that we can work under for years to come.”</p>\n<p>Moreh said a temporary committee comprised of members of I.V. Tenants Union (IVTU), I.V. Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) and Pardall Center staff members will continue to hold meetings Mondays at 4 p.m. beginning May 11 in the conference room of the Pardall Center to discuss the facility’s administration.</p>\n<p>“The way that the [committee] was made was so that anyone could join and become a voting member. Ideally, we would have advertised that, but we didn’t have enough time to get the word out,” Moreh said. “Anyone can come — it is an open meeting — but those are the people currently discussing it.”</p>\n<p>According to Moreh, the committee tabled the bill to allow for the inclusion of amendments that give IVTU and the Legal Resource Center autonomy as renting tenants of the Pardall Center.</p>\n<p>“IVTU and LRC want to be able to have as much autonomy as possible since they are tenants and they should have the ability to run their own space,” Moreh said. “They are on the board, but we also guaranteed them that there would be something in this legislation that would say they have autonomy.”</p>\n<p>EAC sent A Bill to Create the Standing Policies &amp; Procedures of the Pardall Center of The Standing Policies and Procedures of the A.S. UCSB to the consent calendar.</p>\n<p>A Bill to Create Policy 35 will foster more connections between A.S. and I.V., according to Moreh.</p>\n<p>“It is hard because the only one is Pardall Center right now,” Moreh said. “The point is to eventually have so many different paths.”</p>\n<p>Moreh said the bill lays out the expectations, behaviors, parking, advertising and other “dos and don’ts” for use of the Pardall Center.</p>\n<p>“It is important to have because we have had some issues in the Pardall Center and, like any public space, there needs to be a set of policies that governs this space so that we can enforce respectful behavior,” Moreh said.</p>\n<p>After discussing both bills, EAC moved to a discussion on campaigns to address tuition hikes and the upcoming Week of Healing to remember the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>First-year political science and Asian American studies double major Akshaya Natarajan said A.S. is using the “Dear Governor Brown” campaign and a recently released online petition to combat tuition hikes</p>\n<p>“The petition is specifically asking Governor Brown to commit to invest $100 million in the UC system which would freeze tuition which would offset tuition hikes,” Natarajan said.</p>\n<p>Natarajan also discussed “We’re Fucked,” a project to publicize problems caused by state disinvestment in higher education.</p>\n<p>“Our tuition is going up, we aren’t able to pay for very basic necessities, our little brothers and little sisters won’t be able to go to college,” Natarajan said.</p>\n<p>According to Natarajan, A.S. will soon table, host a panel discussion with faculty, share student testimonials and distribute t-shirts to educate students about Dear Governor Brown.</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major and Off-campus Senator Paola Dela Cruz said there will be an art gallery, memorial garden and other installments for the Week of Healing.</p>\n<p>“The Parks District worked closely with the families, they made sure each bench was designed to represent each student,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>Representative-at-large Senator Victor Garcia said the Residence Halls Association (RHA) is participating in BLUNITE, a memorial art installment made up of blue LED lights.</p>\n<p>“RHA has actually bought 300 LED lights for each [residence] hall — so around like 2,700 lights — and they’re going to be distributed at each front desk so residents can come and pick up a light and put a light on their windowsill,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>EAC Chair and third-year anthropology major Carlos Lopez concluded the meeting with information about the AB 3 Sacramento Lobby Day this Wednesday. According to Lopez, organizers plan to bring I.V. residents to Sacramento to promote Assemblymember Das Williams’ I.V. self-governance bill, AB 3, before its hearing in the California State Assembly Committee on Local Government.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to get at least 20 people to go up there to honestly show there is community-supported favor of AB 3 instead of just homeowners — who are going to drive up there because they don’t have school — to say that they don’t want it, or people that are opposed to it in general,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article originally quoted Michelle Moreh as saying “this existing committee could manage spaces with similar commissions,” however the correct quote reads “this existing committee could manage spaces with similar missions.” The article also stated the EAC could potentially manage the Pardall Center, while Moreh in fact said an A.S. in I.V. Governance Board could be created to potentially manage the Pardall Center. The article said this was the first EAC meeting, but the committee has met on previous Mondays at 4 p.m. In addition, Moreh said the bill was tabled to allow for the inclusion of amendments to give IVTU and the Legal Resource Center the majority of power, when the amendments actually allowed IVTU and the Legal Resource Center autonomy as renting tenants.]</p>\n<p><em>This story was updated as of 11:23 p.m. on May 12, 2015.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

artist Julio Salgado will give a talk titled “Queer, Undocumented &amp; Unafraid” in the Theater and Dance building on Saturday to discuss his work as an activist, which will be followed by an art workshop in which attendees can participate.</p>\n<p>Salgado’s talk, hosted by the Research Center of Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), will explore the challenges he faced as a queer and undocumented man of color in the United States and how those experiences shaped his life. Originally born in Mexico, Salgado moved to Long Beach, California at the age of 12, where he was raised.</p>\n<p>Salgado identifies as an “artivist,” an activist who spreads ideas through art. According to Salgado, he began exploring art as a child to cope with the struggle of language barriers.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been making art all my life ever since I moved to this country,” Salgado said. “I feel that art — especially visual art and drawing — have been a way for me to communicate, especially when I didn’t speak English.”</p>\n<p>Salgado said the hardships he faced helped him realize his passion for sharing ideas through art.</p>\n<p>“My experiences as an undocumented immigrant really shaped what I want to do in my art, which is why I wanted to share some of my experiences through poster work, through comic strips and political editorial cartoons,” Salgado said.</p>\n<p>The event aims to provide an environment for queer students and students of color to feel comfortable interacting with their peers and sharing experiences with one another, according to Salgado.</p>\n<p>“When you are a person of color who’s queer, you have to sort of bring this identity with you, so [I am] creating these spaces for a queer person of color because you feel like you’re not alone,” Salgado said. “There’s this feeling of relief that really takes away the pressure of wanting to show how perfect you are, because nobody’s perfect.”</p>\n<p>Salgado said he appreciates students’ interest in his work, and though people “tend to glorify artists who are dead,” he believes it is important for artists to talk about their own work.</p>\n<p>“A lot of students … were doing their thesis about me and writing about my artwork,” Salgado said. “I’m still alive, I’m an artist, so I should be talking about my work.”</p>\n<p>Richard Moreno, fourth-year communication major and RCSGD graphic designer and marketing coordinator, said Salgado’s talk will address issues faced by the undocumented and queer, or “undocu-queer,” community.</p>\n<p>“Julio’s artivist work within the undocu-queer community made him the perfect guest to host an event for our center,” Moreno said in an email. “Students should attend because Julio Salgado sheds light on a very serious issue facing a community that often does not have a voice.”</p>\n<p>Moreno said he looks forward to learning more about Salgado’s past and current work, as well as participating in the art workshop.</p>\n<p>“I am looking forward to hearing Julio speak about his experiences as an activist in the art community,” Moreno said in an email. “I am also interested in [the] art portion of the workshop as well, even though I am not a very talented artist.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63011\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-01/artist-to-speak-on-activism-expression/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63011\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-01/artist-to-speak-on-activism-expression/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-01/artist-to-speak-on-activism-expression/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-01/artist-to-speak-on-activism-expression/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-01/artist-to-speak-on-activism-expression/","id":2777,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2776,2775,2774],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
