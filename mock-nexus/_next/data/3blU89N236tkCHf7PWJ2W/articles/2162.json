In order to actually hold an executive office, the candidate must also fulfill the same requirements.</li>\n<li>An executive office must be declared vacant during a Senate meeting if there is the removal, disqualification or resignation of an officer. The “disqualification” portion is an addition to the previous version of legal code.</li>\n<li>Candidates can now use a preferred name when running. They have the option to either use their legal name or the name as it appears on student records for the ballot.</li>\n<li>Candidates are no longer required to attend the mixer/event/retreat that is typically held following the declaration of candidacy meeting.</li>\n<li>Any candidates involved in violations that “may have led” to party disqualification will be disqualified, while the remaining candidates will run as independents. Previously, all candidates who were running with a disqualified party would be prohibited from running in the year of the party’s disqualification.</li>\n<li>Submission for declaration of candidacy forms for the Spring Quarter general election will begin on the Wednesday of week seven of Winter Quarter, and will continue until Wednesday of the ninth week of Winter Quarter.</li>\n<li>Active campaigning is prohibited until Tuesday of week three of Spring Quarter at 8 p.m. It was previously prohibited until Wednesday of week three of Spring Quarter.</li>\n<li>Recruitment events will begin the Sunday of week six of Winter Quarter, as opposed to week five.</li>\n<li>Recruitment plans, materials and agendas must be submitted to elections board by the Friday of week five of Winter Quarter.</li>\n<li>Campaign boards now cannot be set up before the start of soft campaigning.</li>\n<li>Candidate forums are mandatory except for class conflicts, severe illness or extenuating circumstances, which must be approved by the Elections Board.</li>\n<li>The final ballot must be approved by Senate no later than week two of spring quarter, as opposed to the previous deadline of week nine of Winter Quarter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Changes involving voting methods:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Distribution of the votes will be handled through the proportional Scottish Method.</li>\n<li>Students cannot vote for the same candidate more than once or rank them in the same position twice.</li>\n<li>All the votes above the minimum threshold are proportionally distributed among the next available candidates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Changes involving overall elections:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The mandatory candidate orientation meeting will now be held during the ninth week of Winter Quarter, rather than week eight.</li>\n<li>Parties will be held accountable for any “inappropriate campaign engagement” that may be done by party supporters.</li>\n<li>Party slate forms must be turned in during week nine of Winter Quarter rather than the previous week eight.</li>\n<li>A.S. spaces, revenues, spaces, staff or resources cannot be used while endorsing or opposing fee initiatives, referendums or petitions, unless it is educational.</li>\n<li>Elections Board “shall maintain the right to refer any complaints” to the correct entity, which includes, but is not limited to, Judicial Council, Judicial Affairs or Residential Housing Association (RHA).</li>\n<li>Intent to put an initiative, petition or referendum on the ballot is due by Friday at 4 p.m. during week one of Winter Quarter.

Great moments in sports photography sometimes happen in less than one one-thousandth of a second. Within that extremely narrow time frame, given the proper equipment and timing (one part skill, two parts serendipity), a photographer can capture the essentials of story-telling with a photograph. An athlete’s pose and facial expression are obvious components of a good shot. Underrated but also important in composing a picture that engages the reader and complements a story are the little details. For instance, when the flakes of powder a snowboarder kicks up or the chunks of rubber a soccer player disrupts on a turf field. The same little details, such as a runner casually spitting as she races, can disqualify a photo from being front page material, unless perhaps the story was on the new trend of tobacco chewing on the womens’ cross country team.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-31767\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-17/eighth-weekly-photo-week-spit/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-31767\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-17/eighth-weekly-photo-week-spit/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-17/eighth-weekly-photo-week-spit/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-17/eighth-weekly-photo-week-spit/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-17/eighth-weekly-photo-week-spit/","id":2159,"author":{"id":326,"name":"Jon Kopecky"},"related":[2158,2157,2156],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NFL Divisional Playoff Preview: Jets v.

Intriguing matchups to watch for during this game come straight from the line of scrimmage. Three-hundred-twenty-five-pound Patriot defensive lineman Vince Wilfork will line up against Jets lineman Nick Mangold, while the other side of the ball hosts a faceoff between perennial pro-bowlers Jason Taylor of the Jets and Patriot lineman Matt Light. The outcome of these matchups will significantly affect each team’s offensive strategy, and the final score of the game.</p>\n<p>After a 45-3 decimation of the Jets earlier this season, New England will continue to rely on its offensive line to protect Brady in the pocket, who hasn’t had a turnover in the past 11 games and has led New England to score at least 31 points per game since Nov. 7.</p>\n<p>The Jets’ defense will need to increase its output from the game against the Colts, in which New York safety Eric Smith led the team with 10 tackles. It’s important to remember that though New England smashed the Jets by 42 points in their last meeting, New York did beat the Patriots in the first matchup for these two teams earlier this year.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As Jets coach Rex Ryan said, maybe Tom Brady doesn’t “study” as much as Peyton Manning.

I think they’re amazing. They’re diamonds in the rough but diamonds sure enough,” F4Y Executive Director Billi Jo Starr said.</p>\n<p>“It’s about the youth and what they’ve wanted and what they’ve asked for. It’s evolved from a complete bottom-up approach.”</p>\n<p>The campaign will donate 100 percent of the profits from the candles to the camp, according to the campaign’s Facebook page.</p>\n<p>“UCSB and our mentors have been a huge part of that sustainability because of their dedication and their outreach and their ideas, like the Re-Ignite the Light campaign,” Starr said. Most of the F4Y mentors have been personally impacted by juvenile incarceration, she added.</p>\n<p>UCSB F4Y focuses their efforts on helping juveniles while they are incarcerated as well as after they leave, according to Valerie Casillas, UCSB F4Y president.</p>\n<p>“They reach out to us wanting help and we do whatever we can to help them, whether it’s clothes that they need when they get out of camp, helping them look for jobs or career-building,” Casillas said. “We’re here to help every step of the way.”</p>\n<p>An unprecedented partnership between UCSB’s Comparative Literature Department and F4Y emerged when Starr and UCSB CCS professor, Rick Benjamin, co-taught a class titled Literatures of Juvenile Justice.</p>\n<p>Miguel Ramirez, a co-founder of F4Y and previous student of Starr’s outreach at the Camp, has firsthand experience with the struggles of the juvenile justice system and the opportunities of F4Y.</p>\n<p>“In the system, there’s a lot of rehabilitation programs offered for when we’re locked up, and when we get out, they just forget about us. The resources don’t extend to when we’re out and we need the help, suffering from peer pressure or problems at home,” Ramirez said.</p>\n<p>“Freedom 4 Youth was the only program that actually touched base on the outs… [Billi] never really told us to remove ourselves from the gangs. It was more of an outlet to stay away from them and towards positive outreach. It stuck.”</p>\n<p>Dylan Griffith, a returning UCSB student and supervisor of campus mentors, uses his knowledge to further understand the pitfalls of the juvenile justice system.</p>\n<p>“[People] might not think it affects them directly, but their perception of people who are involved in the system or those who are system-impacted, drives their actions potentially more than they understand,” Griffith said.</p>\n<p>Along with the rest of the F4Y team, Griffith, Starr, Ramirez and Casillas participated in fundraisers such as the Re-Ignite the Light campaign and other projects, like creating holiday care packages for women and children in the Santa Barbara County Jail and sending families of incarcerated youth assorted gift cards.</p>\n<p>The care package project was organized by F4Y and was funded by UCSB Community Affairs Board and Associated Students.</p>\n<p>F4Y is also working to influence state policy; they recently visited Sacramento to speak with California state senators about the state’s current sentencing structure.</p>\n<p>All of the outreach, issues and upcoming projects were discussed at an annual F4Y conference held last May, which marked the seventh anniversary of the conference.</p>\n<p>F4Y’s ultimate goal is to both help juveniles resolve their issues and create foundations for their success in the future, Griffith said.</p>\n<p>“We’re not here to just fix problems. We’re here to plant seeds, to empower people to deal with their own lives in whatever way they choose.”</p>\n<p><em>Nyah Scott is a reporter for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 7, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nyah-scott/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nyah Scott</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Nyah Scott is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.
