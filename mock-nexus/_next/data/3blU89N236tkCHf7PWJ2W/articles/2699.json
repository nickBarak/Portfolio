The announcement to divest came after increased student pressure from a dozen schools following the May oil spill in Santa Barbara, preceded by three years of constant campaigning from Fossil Free UC.  Despite the partial victory, the University of California continues to invest in oil and gas industries involved in processes like the controversial method of hydraulic fracturing.</p>\n<p>Fossil Free UCSB Organizer and global studies graduate Theo LeQuesne said Fossil Free UC is a fossil fuel divestment campaign targeting the top 200 fossil fuel industries, discerned by the amount of carbon dioxide the companies release into the atmosphere. LeQuesne said divesting from the industries forces them to take responsibility for their environmental impact.</p>\n<p>“The reason we are targeting these industries is not necessarily that we think we can financially bankrupt them,” LeQuesne said. “The reason we want to do that is because they have assured themselves not to be responsible in terms of the public interest.”</p>\n<p>According to LeQuesne, fossil fuel industries lobby to block legislation targeting climate change, which motivates Fossil Free UC to continue the campaign advocating for divestment.</p>\n<p>“The fossil fuel industry has an enormous lobbying power and it’s really not okay for these people to uphold democracy and the way that politics are going at the moment,” LeQuesne said. “We will continue for divestment and we will be doing that for as long as it takes. We’re not going anywhere.”</p>\n<p>LeQuesne said the goal of Fossil Free UCSB is to change people’s perspective on the fossil fuel industry by educating the public on the industry’s tactics and impacts in person as well as online through social media.</p>\n<p>“We do this by having conversations with people at the arbor,” LeQuesne said. “It’s a long process, it’s one person at a time. By talking to people we encourage them to come to our meetings and get involved which is really a wonderful thing to see happening on campus.”</p>\n<p>LeQuesne said another goal is to reinvest the UC’s capital in more sustainable practices.</p>\n<p>“Once divestment occurs you have a lot of capitol to reinvest,” LeQuesne said. “We’re not just pushing for divestment, but putting that capitol to help benefit smaller communities and to help prevent climate change. It requires a different way of thinking of divestment.”</p>\n<p>According to LeQuesne, though the oil spill in Santa Barbara last May was damaging to the environment, it also united the UCSB community to demand the UC recognize its responsibility regarding the spill.</p>\n<p>“We had about 75 students demonstrating outside of Chancellor Yang’s office against UC investments,” LeQuesne said. “The UC has investments in Exxon mobile, for example, and Exxon Mobile’s oil was running through that pipeline that burst and endangered a whole bunch of wildlife.”</p>\n<p>LeQuesne said Fossil Free UCSB has been campaigning for three years and are excited to have won a “partial victory” through student involvement.</p>\n<p>“The recent victory is really testament that you can as a student make a difference through campaigning and activism and that is really exciting to see,” LeQuesne said. “It’s a shame that the recent divestment didn’t result in oil and gas, it was only coal and tar sands. It’s really a matter of time, I believe. It’s not an everyday occurrence.”</p>\n<p>Second-year chemistry major Isaiah Swauncy said he thinks divestment will help the shift from fossil fuels towards more sustainable alternatives.</p>\n<p>“I think fossil fuels are definitely ruining the environment,” Swauncy said. “I think it’s a great idea and stepping stone for the rest of the U.S. However, until we find another energy source that can sustain the population we can’t completely stop using fossil fuels but the UC can help with divestment.”</p>\n<p>Fossil Free UC leader and UC Berkeley creative writing major Jake Soiffer said it is about time the UC began divesting from fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>“This is a hard-fought victory for students and our allies from across California who have been demanding the UC truly live up to its big talk on climate change,” Soiffer said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 8 in the Thursday, Sept. 17, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64731\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/uc-divests-200-million-from-big-oil/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64731\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/uc-divests-200-million-from-big-oil/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/uc-divests-200-million-from-big-oil/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/uc-divests-200-million-from-big-oil/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/uc-divests-200-million-from-big-oil/","id":2699,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2698,2697,2696],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel","biography":"Not available","articles":[999,2610,2699,2798,2804,2838,2843,2845,2887,2901,2922,2950,2967,2968,2985,3445,4573,4652,4658,4659,4679,4680,4697,4804,4816],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Student Group Funding Process Gets Makeover","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Finance-Board_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Finance-Board_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Associated Students Finance and Business Committee (A.S.

F&amp;B) recently announced several new additions to its website for the upcoming year in an attempt to help facilitate the funding process for student groups.</p>\n<p>The A.S. F&amp;B, previously known as the A.S. Finance Board, is tasked with allocating annual student fees to help fund events and services of registered student organizations. Last year, the finance board was responsible for designating the spending of the Associated Students’ $10.9 million budget, $364,812 of which went to student organizations. The committee redesigned its website and logo this summer as part of its “rebranding” efforts.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B Chairman and third-year history of public policy and political science double major Jerel Constantino said the new website will make it easier for student groups to request funding compared to the lack of “transparency” and “accessibility” in last year’s committee operations.</p>\n<p>“I felt like a lot of students didn’t really feel like we wanted to give their money back to them, which is kind of what our role is,” Constantino said. “We just want to get a new look. We want to make our brand everywhere just so that people know that this is the committee you go to to get funding and access to the fees, and part of that is redoing the website.”</p>\n<p>According to Constantino, one of the website’s new features is an online form for rollover requests and event reports, which he said could act as archives for students to use as references in future funding requests.</p>\n<p>“In the past, we’ve just relied on asking students, ‘How much money did we give you last year?’ but that’s not really accurate and there’s really not much record keeping in those regards,” Constantino said. “Since these forms are online now, any student will be able to look up just how much money this org spent and what they spent it on online.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B Vice-Chair and third-year political science major Isabelle Ninh said confusion over policies and procedures repeatedly arose during last year’s funding processes.</p>\n<p>“When student groups were going through the funding process, a lot of the same questions kept popping up again about policies [and] procedures and what not,” Ninh said in an email. “This year, we’re aiming to solve that by providing guides and other resources that will increase clarity and give more detailed instruction so that the funding process is more efficient.”</p>\n<p>Constantino said the committee also hopes to allocate more funding to newer and smaller student groups rather than mostly funding events for larger organizations.</p>\n<p>“A large part of our funding has gone to organizations that already have a lot of funding — they can afford to fork over a few thousand dollars for their barbeque,” Constantino said. “I’d like to see more organizations, especially newer and smaller ones, being represented, to get their piece of the pie.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year computer science major Benji Lampel, who sought funding from the committee in the past for events like SB Hacks and Laughology, said the only improvement A.S. F&amp;B needs to make is increasing its financial visibility for student groups.</p>\n<p>“The only thing they could really improve on I think is making the funding easier to see when it’s distributed,” Lampel said in an email. “It was just hard to tell when the money was transferred and how much we actually got.”</p>\n<p>Ninh said A.S. F&amp;B plans to continue making events like SB Hacks possible.</p>\n<p>“So many of our students have really great ideas on how to give back to our community and enrich the student body as a whole,” Ninh said in an email. “I’m really looking forward to hearing them all, and my team and I are excited to make that happen.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 9 in the Thursday, Sept. 17, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64732\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/student-group-funding-process-gets-makeover/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64732\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/student-group-funding-process-gets-makeover/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/student-group-funding-process-gets-makeover/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/student-group-funding-process-gets-makeover/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/student-group-funding-process-gets-makeover/","id":2696,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2695,2694,2693],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"International Student Alagie Jammeh Risks Life To Speak Out Against Homophobia","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-4.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“No one should be denied their fundamental basic human rights because of their sexuality,” Alagie Jammeh posted on Facebook in September 2014.

After posting his views on Facebook, he was cut off from his scholarship, friends and family, and may still lose his life.</p>\n<p><i>The Washington Post</i> quotes President Yahya Jammeh of the Gambia as having said, “If you are a man and want to marry another man in this country and we catch you, no one will ever set eyes on you again, and no white person can do anything about it.”</p>\n<p>Having grown up in the Gambia under the rule of President Jammeh — his distant uncle — Jammeh learned that homosexuality was one of the greatest sins humans could commit.</p>\n<p>“They keep teaching people that homosexuality is evil and bad … They have this big law that homosexuality is the worst crime you could do as a human being,” Jammeh said. “When I got here [California], I see a different story.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64374\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1784699764\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64366\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64374\" data-attachment-id=\"64374\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-28/international-student-alagie-jammeh-risks-life-to-speak-out-against-homophobia/alagie-jammeh-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-3.jpg?fit=1335%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1335,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1437994304\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Alagie Jammeh-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-3.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-3.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64374\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-3-684x1024.jpg?resize=500%2C749\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"500\" height=\"749\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-3.jpg?resize=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-3.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-3.jpg?w=1335&amp;ssl=1 1335w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64374\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>After learning his roommate and good friend identified as homosexual, Jammeh began to question the anti-gay views he was taught in his home country. And, in an attempt to show solidarity with his roommate, Jammeh wrote those 14 words that may one day get him killed.</p>\n<p>Within hours after posting the message on his Facebook, Jammeh received a call from a relative in Gambia saying, “If the government sees this thing, you are dead.”</p>\n<p>“I deleted the message,” Jammeh said, “but it was too late.”</p>\n<p>The comment Jammeh wrote directly contradicts the views of his uncle, the president, and he soon found himself stripped of his scholarship, ostracized from his country and fearful for his survival.</p>\n<p>“Going back to the Gambia is like committing suicide,” Jammeh said. “There are people who might feel sorry, but not really sorry.”</p>\n<p>For months after posting this message, Jammeh was forced to sell many of his personal belongings, live in his own car, shower in the Recreation Center and hope for his next meal, all while continuing to attend UCSB and maintaining a GPA well above average.</p>\n<p>History Department Chair Sharon Farmer taught a class which Jammeh attended during this time, and said she was amazed to discover he was living in his car the entire time.</p>\n<p>“He is clearly a very sincere student, and to find out that the whole time he was in my class [he was living in his car] … He made it through two quarters and didn’t tell anybody” Farmer said.</p>\n<p>Jammeh said during these months he was still expecting his government to begin providing him financial support again, but he never saw another penny.</p>\n<p>“For two months, the money was on the way … never came,” Jammeh said. “When I go to class, I couldn’t concentrate — I kept having these suicidal thoughts.”</p>\n<p>Despite his inward struggle, Farmer said Jammeh was “such a nice guy” who was “very motivated” in his studies.</p>\n<p>After coming forward with his situation, Jammeh began working with the director of the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), Simran Singh, to find a way to continue to attend UCSB and survive.</p>\n<p>According to Singh, Jammeh’s case has been taken very seriously by the administration and continues to be a primary concern of her office.</p>\n<p>“You do not have a student come in and make that up,” said Singh. “It’s gone up the ladder — everybody is aware of the situation.”</p>\n<p>According to David Whitman, the director of LGBT services and the Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity, Jammeh’s case is a perfect example of “how alive and well homophobia is.”</p>\n<p>“This isn’t out of convenience or luxury, this man is facing life in prison or worse for being supportive of the LGBTQ community,” Whitman said. “Give this student a penny, a dollar, because he is facing life in prison and he deserves it.”</p>\n<p>Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Mary Jacob said Jammeh’s case is “really a challenge” and that options for Jammeh are limited because of his status as an international student.</p>\n<p>“He’s been supporting people who are gay, which could be viewed as supporting criminality [in the Gambia],” Jacob said. “He would definitely be imprisoned, and I really fear for his health and well-being.”</p>\n<p>According to Singh, there have been many attempts to communicate with the Gambian government through their embassy in Washington D.C., but there has been no response from the President.</p>\n<p>“The ambassador seemed pretty much helpless unless he got help from the Gambian government,” Singh said. “The money needs to be transferred from Gambia.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the university has temporarily allowed Jammeh to continue attending classes while he struggles to come up with funding and also seek political asylum, without which he could be sent back to the Gambia.</p>\n<p>“Right now, the school said they were going to let me go to school for fall and then I have time to work and see if I could get some scholarships from somewhere, and I have also applied for asylum … So it’s 50-50,” Jammeh said.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Statewide Affairs and fourth-year sociology and black studies double major Mohsin Mirza said he looks to the UC Office of The President for its support of Jammeh and believes a community effort is absolutely necessary in supporting Jammeh.</p>\n<p>“It’s a difficult situation, but I’m hopeful that the people can come together and donate to help and that administration and UCOP can take the actions needed so that Alagie can stay,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Through the help of the OISS and other local organizations, Jammeh has secured temporary housing through the summer with local resident Mariela Marin and her family, as well as a job on campus.</p>\n<p>“I can honestly say that [Jammeh] is someone who is clearly dedicated to the journey of understanding his world and others,” said Marin. “We’re just really lucky to have him.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Jammeh’s future remains highly uncertain, as it is unclear where he will live after the summer and whether or not he will be able to continue to attend the university.</p>\n<p>Despite having deleted the original message and Facebook account, Jammeh now has a rainbow flag on his new profile picture and maintains that he is very firm in his belief that the LGBTQ community should be treated equally as human beings.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64375\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-4.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1253416888\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64366\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64375\" data-attachment-id=\"64375\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-28/international-student-alagie-jammeh-risks-life-to-speak-out-against-homophobia/alagie-jammeh-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1437994386\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Alagie Jammeh-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-4.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64375\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-4-1024x684.jpg?resize=600%2C401\" alt=\"The Facebook status Jammeh posted defending homosexuality directly contradicts the views of his distant uncle, president of the Gambia.

The Index is based on the share of students receiving Pell grants, the graduation rate of Pell grant recipients and the net cost after financial aid for low and middle income students. This year’s results led the NYT to call UC “California’s upward mobility machine.”</p>\n<p>Thirty-eight percent of UCSB students receive Pell grants, with 31 percent also likely to graduate based on past rates, and the net cost for low and middle income students is $14,000.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA), University of California Student Association (UCSA) undergraduate chair and fourth-year black studies and sociology double major Mohsin Mirza said NYT’s praise of UC as an “upward mobility machine” is “somewhat incomplete.”</p>\n<p>“Students of all incomes struggle with the rising costs of housing and textbooks,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>“While the UC should be praised for the amount of financial aid it provides to low income students, particularly in comparison to other universities, that praise should be tempered with the reality that there is much work to be done.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said while the College Access Index highlights the successes of UC, UCSA will continue to be critical.</p>\n<p>“We see our role as pushing the UC to be the best it possibly can be,” Mirza said. “Praise isn’t effective at creating changes, actions and pressure are.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Director of Admissions Lisa Przekop said she feels UCSB is “very proactive” in creating economic diversity and its high ranking in the College Access Index is a result of outreach efforts that start long before the admissions process.</p>\n<p>“We work closely with high school and community college counselors to spread the word about opportunities available at UCSB,” Przekop said in an email. “We also work with community organizations and early outreach programs to reach younger students and families as they begin to consider college preparation.”</p>\n<p>According to Przekop, one way UCSB works to serve low-income students is being “visible and available,” providing information that explains the application and financial aid processes and shows low-income families higher education is “a viable pathway to success.”</p>\n<p>“Some families don’t have a history of college attendance and fear that the cost is a barrier to even considering college,” Przekop said in an email. “We have special programs in place to meet the informational needs of first-generation and/or low-income students because they may not have easy access to that information otherwise.”</p>\n<p>Przekop said outreach and informational assistance are the only ways UC campuses increase their numbers of Pell-receiving students, because the admissions process itself is “need blind.”</p>\n<p>“Family income cannot be a deciding factor in admitting a student,” Przekop said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Przekop, the Office of Admissions promotes UCSB at over 600 high schools every fall and chooses campuses with students of all economic backgrounds, leading to greater economic diversity at the university.</p>\n<p>“These schools include those situated in low-income, middle-income, and high-income regions of the state,” Przekop said in an email. “We want students from all backgrounds because we want a diverse learning community.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major and Pell grant recipient Chance Adkins said while he was surprised UCSB is ranked third in the nation on the College Access Index, he is not surprised it was ranked highly given his experience with financial aid opportunities.</p>\n<p>“I was offered more financial aid here than anywhere else,” Adkins said. “Talking to people who attend other universities, the gap between my financial aid and theirs is higher than one would expect, especially between the UCs.”</p>\n<p>Adkins said while he is glad aid is available when needed, he believes the high number of students receiving Pell grants at UC could explain in part the recent increases in tuition and is a sign that public higher education is increasingly unaffordable without aid.</p>\n<p>“With the way that tuition keeps increasing, it makes sense that more people are needing assistance,” Adkins said.</p>\n<p>Mirza said UC should be proud of the ranking but should not let it take away from the urgency to take on “problems that still exist.”</p>\n<p>“Between unaffordable housing, students skipping meals to save money, and the majority of students in the middle class, in particular taking on tens of thousands of dollars in debt, there is much work to be done,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, September 24, 2015 print edition of the<em> Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
