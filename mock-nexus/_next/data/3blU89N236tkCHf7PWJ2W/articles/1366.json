Two very important matches occurred earlier today. Early in the morning, Argentina and France faced off, later in the day, Portugal and Uruguay played. Never have I seen such exciting games at this stage of the competition. I will breakdown the first match played at 7:00 A.M. first.</p>\n<p>France came in with high hopes for this tournament. Not only do they have an excellent lineup of talented players, but they also have a few familiar faces with more experience and growth. Griezmann, Pogba, and Giroud all performed exceptionally well this world cup. There is one star who has just made it to the limelight however. His performance will probably go on in history, for decades to come.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>​That man is Kylian Mbappé Lottin. Born in Bondy, just shy of 19 years ago, Mbappé has risen to the ranks of the young Ronaldo. Early in the game, a quick sprint by Mbappé propelled him past the Argentinian defense into the penalty box where he was fouled. This gave the French their first opportunity as they received a penalty kick. Griezmann shot it and delivered! Then, the unthinkable happened. Right near the end of the first half, Di Maria hit it right in the net. The game was all tied up 1-1 heading to the break.</p>\n<p>Right near the start of the second half. Mercado deflects a shot by Messi and hits it in. Now, the French are on the verge of elimination! 57th minute, the French respond right back tying it up at 2 goals each. The game continues on until the return of Mbappé, who scores another goal for the French side bringing them up 3-2. Just minutes later, Mbappé comes in again and scores for France.</p>\n<p>Near the last minutes of the match, desperate Argentinian sides do whatever it takes to catch up. The 93rd minutes sees Sergio Agüero hit it in. Unfortunately, this wasn’t enough for them. Messi and company will go home tonight. France will move on to face either Uruguay or Portugal.</p>\n<p>It is great to be a football player; you get to really live a great life. Not to mention the amount of money you make. Mbappé however, does not seem too motivated by the money. The man, who scored two goals for the French, wants to donate all of his FIFA earnings to charity. What a great guy!</p>\n<p>Just a few hours later, Uruguay, led by the 71 year old Óscar Tabárez faced off against Portugal lead by, well, Ronaldo maybe? Uruguay delivered an incredible performance ousting the Portuguese. Early in the first half, Cavani, assisted by Suárez, shot it in. In the 55th minute, Pepe for Portugal responded tying this game up 1-1. This ended Uruguay’s run of 597 minutes of not conceding a goal. Pretty amazing, if you ask me! Then, in the 62nd minute, Cavani scores again for the Uruguayan side. Portugal tried very hard to make something happen, but block after block shut them down. Uruguay took this one by their teeth. It could not have happened without their head coach however.</p>\n<p>Tabárez, pictured below, suffers from a rare degenerative disease known as Guillain-Barre syndrome. It mainly affects the limbs and causes numbness and weakness. Through it all, he decided to fight through and help his team move forward. The 71 year old is nicknamed ‘El Maestro’ (The Teacher) since he used to work at a school.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1881650776\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83622\"><img data-attachment-id=\"83624\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-30/the-71-year-old-man-with-the-cane-ronaldo-messis-fall-and-the-new-hero/omeed-pic-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg?fit=468%2C305&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"468,305\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Omeed pic 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg?fit=250%2C163&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg?fit=468%2C305&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83624\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg?resize=468%2C305\" alt=\"\" width=\"468\" height=\"305\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg?resize=250%2C163&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Omeed-pic-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&amp;ssl=1 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>At the end of today, two teams are through. France and Uruguay will be facing off next week on Friday at 7 A.M PST. This one will be quite the thrill. I think it will be very close, but France will have the edge. Looks like Messi and Ronaldo won’t be meeting for a match this world cup. Yet, they will still be meeting at the airport on the way back!</p>\n<p>Tomorrow we will see the World Cup hosts face off against 2010 World Cup champions. Later in the day, a powerful Croatia will face off against Denmark, who tied against France. I think Croatia and Spain will come out victorious.

In the case of Gaucho alumnus Mike Heid, class of 1995 graduate, his affinity for UCSB men’s soccer has formed a community between both current and incoming Gaucho sports fans and veterans that have been around for decades.</p>\n<p>Heid is the creator of <em>gauchosoccer.com</em>, a blog with ties to nearly any and all things related to UCSB men’s soccer.</p>\n<p>According to the website’s archives tab, information on the site dates back as early as Sept. 2016.</p>\n<p>Insight on current and former Gauchos that are now playing at either the MLS or international pro levels, the program’s 2018 recruiting class and even the formations and plays the team ran while on the field are all available on Heid’s site.</p>\n<p>Although intriguing, the website’s most striking piece of content is Heid’s self-titled “How I Procured My Own UCSB Soccer Jersey: A Case Study in Citizen Journalism.”</p>\n<p>With little to lose as an avid UCSB men’s soccer fan looking to further support his alum, Heid took his right to citizen journalism beyond the keyboard and into public records to satisfy his need for a conclusion.</p>\n<p>Despite being home to 20 Division-I sports programs, UCSB is not necessarily a sports powerhouse.</p>\n<p>With that said, the search for a team jersey in any sport is a likely afterthought for many, but not all.</p>\n<p>While browsing <em>ucsbgauchos.com</em>, one would likely come across the athletics department’s “UCSB shop” tab and would eventually find their way onto its Gauchos Shop.<br>\nCategorized under the site’s “men’s jersey” tab, the only available jerseys for purchase are for baseball and men’s basketball.</p>\n<p>Published on Nov. 4, Heid’s article chronicles his search to purchase a UCSB men’s soccer jersey, a seven-month process that began in April of this year.</p>\n<p>Trailblazing Heid’s investigation was a question about the availability of purchasing a men’s soccer jersey on the UCSB sub-Reddit a while back, influencing him to exhaust all of his possible resources in hopes of finding an answer.</p>\n<p>“For years, I’ve wanted to buy UCSB soccer jerseys. Every year I go to the Gaucho shop and jersey section, and every year it’s the same stuff. There was one year when they did sell the actual jersey, which I still have, but [nothing else since].”</p>\n<p>One of his first steps was reaching out to staff within the UCSB athletics department.</p>\n<p>His exchange of emails primarily took place with Richard Loza, director of Marketing, Branding and Sales and Bryan Cornet, the department’s assistant athletics director of Sales and External Relations.</p>\n<p>In an email sent to Cornet, Heid even offered to put up his own money for the UCSB athletics department to use in hopes of them buying the jerseys and putting them up for sale.</p>\n<p>He proposed the idea that if the jerseys didn’t bring in any revenue, he would accept the loss and not get his money back. If the jerseys were to sell, he would make his money back and the department would keep the profit.</p>\n<p>Due to university regulations, the school was unable to accept the offer. But it wasn’t this fact alone that prompted Heid to continue his investigation.</p>\n<p>Rather, it was the estimated costs to produce the jerseys that seemed most contradictory. With Nike as the university’s sponsor at the time, prior to changing to Adidas, Heid was informed that the athletics department ordered “custom” jerseys that cost around $180 a piece.</p>\n<p>For any sports fan, the only merchandise that likely hits that market price or higher is an authentic NBA Hardwood Classics jersey, a pair of retro Michael Jordan sneakers or some other form of ultra-vintage memorabilia.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the price just didn’t add up.</p>\n<p>As expected, the $180 price tag suggested definitely caught Heid off guard, considering his history as a consumer of both authentic and replica soccer jerseys.</p>\n<p>The price, paired with dwindling communication with the athletics department, led to Heid filing a public records request to verify the information he had been given about the production of the jerseys.</p>\n<p>His request was to receive information about the men’s soccer program’s purchases from the past three years, in addition to the contract UCSB Athletics had with Nike.</p>\n<p>Once his request was fulfilled and the invoices were delivered, the claim that the jerseys cost $180 was quickly disproven as UCSB was actually paying $30-40 for each jersey, which was a discounted cost nearly half the retail price.</p>\n<p>Considering UCSB’s switch from Nike to Adidas, Heid ended up filing another public records request regarding the team’s costs for jerseys by the new sponsor.</p>\n<p>From May 31 throughout August, Heid was left empty-handed with no records as he was told that there were no invoices or receipts for jerseys under the new partnership.</p>\n<p>“I made two separate requests. For my second request, I had to do about 10 follow-ups,” he said. “I don’t think Athletics was necessarily caught off guard that I was up to something and maybe verifying what they had told me. Maybe they were caught off guard with what I did with the info. But I also didn’t want the whole thing to turn adversarial. I was a little afraid that I would ostracize myself from the process.”</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until Aug. 29 when Heid received order confirmation documents for both the team’s home and away jerseys. But the documentation only went so far, as Heid ended up reaching out to Adidas and eventually was put in touch with a retail vendor.</p>\n<p>Communication with Adidas was the peak of Heid’s investigation. Similar to the Nike partnership, UCSB’s new deal with Adidas also consisted of jersey prices being within the $40 range and served as the deciding factor for him purchasing a wholesale amount of blue and white jerseys on Sept. 21. He received his order on Nov. 3.</p>\n<p>With the promise that he was willing to donate to UCSB, he bought a total of 64 authentic UCSB men’s soccer jerseys, spending a total amount of $2,958.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79951\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2110208514\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79946\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79951\" data-attachment-id=\"79951\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/the-secret-life-of-jerseys-an-alums-quest-to-rep-ucsb-mens-soccer/jersey-story-receipt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt.jpg?fit=805%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"805,1024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"jersey story receipt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt.jpg?fit=197%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt.jpg?fit=805%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-79951\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt-805x1024.jpg?resize=450%2C572\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"572\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt.jpg?w=805&amp;ssl=1 805w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt.jpg?resize=197%2C250&amp;ssl=1 197w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt.jpg?resize=768%2C977&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79951\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Receipt courtesy of Mike Heid</p></div>\n<p>With UCSB Athletics uninterested in selling the jerseys and Heid’s cautiousness for trademark violations, he ended up giving them away to former players and fans that held UCSB soccer dear to their hearts similar to him.</p>\n<p>Although Heid was able to confirm his skepticism about the production costs of the jersey, his agenda wasn’t to one up the athletics department and prove them wrong.</p>\n<p>Instead, the former Gaucho is one of many that truly love the UCSB men’s soccer program and created an investigation that was dedicated to further connecting the team to its supporters.</p>\n<p>“It’s not just about athletics making money from [the jerseys],” Heid said. “It’s also about the fans getting what they want and the program getting more visibility. That’s all just a part of the general [goal] to spread goodwill.</p>\n<p>“Even though it can’t always be quantified, I think these benefits made it seem like it was the thing to do.”</p>\n<p>The use of the Public Records Act sounds daunting, but Heid’s purpose of using it went beyond the investigation and had a focus to illustrate the effectiveness of citizen journalism.</p>\n<p>“I generally wanted and still want for the end result to be that Athletics sees that there is some value in [making the jerseys] and pursuing it,” Heid said. “I haven’t heard from anyone from Athletics and I have not reached out to them again. I plan on maybe doing so eventually, but I first want to see how this plays its way out.”</p>\n<p>At the moment, the result is the same — no jerseys for sale.</p>\n<p>While the name “UCSB” remains on the jerseys, Heid’s investigation is more valuable than just the desire to wear the printed numbers and letters.</p>\n<p>His commitment was a testament directed toward uplifting the UCSB sports community.</p>\n<p>Read Heid’s blog post at <em>gauchosoccer.com</em>.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Nov. 30, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

Racioppi didn’t let another ball past her for the remainder of the tournament, which saw the Gauchos top Ohio, Vermont, Cal Poly, Penn State and Texas in succession.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, UCSB’s easiest wins were its last two. The Gauchos blew out the Nittany Lions 4-0 in the semifinal and hung a 3-0 shutout on the Longhorns in the tournament final.</p>\n<p>A dominant defense was the common thread between this year’s championship team and last year’s side.</p>\n<p>UCSB surrendered only one goal in the 2016 tournament, which saw the Gauchos defeat UNC in a 1-0 thriller for the title.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s club soccer success goes beyond just the last two seasons. No other team has more than three national titles in the last 11 years. The Gauchos have seven.</p>\n<p>“One of the traditions we like to talk about is our success on the field and what we bring to each game,” Head Coach Todd Heil said. “Back-to-back is great and seven is pretty impressive, but year in and year out we’ve just been very fortunate to have a great group of girls.”</p>\n<p>Such dominance is only possible through passion and commitment on the part of everyone involved in the club soccer program. That starts with the players, naturally.</p>\n<p>“With the club sports mentality, it’s a group of girls that just truly want to be there and want to play the game,” Heil said. “They’re there on their own behest; they’re not there on scholarship. They are what some might call the true student-athletes, and when it clicks and they just want to all be there together, that’s even more special.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the players contribute more to the program than just their on-field performance. They’re the front-line recruiters for the team as well, manning booths and getting the word out in order to bolster the roster each year.</p>\n<p>“A lot of [the recruitment] is on the returning player,” Heil said. “Basically, you’re [creating] the path. If it’s not social media, then you’re working a table at Spring Insight. You’re just trying to get the word out once students actually become students of UCSB.”<br>\nOnce the recruitment work has been done and the season has actually started, things don’t get any easier for the club players.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s soccer club team practices three times a week rather than six times like the Division I team, but it has to balance those practices against a full schedule of academics and extracurricular activities.</p>\n<p>“Our weeks are so busy that the weekends would be a great time to get school work done, but during fall these weekends are filled with games,” Club President Ann Marie Mansholt, a four-year player, said. “This just means that time management is crucial, and we somehow get it done, whether it’s studying on a plane or in the lobbies of our hotels.”<br>\nThe club season starts right alongside school in late September and wastes no time in getting going.</p>\n<p>“We get going the first week of school,” Heil said. “We have regionals the fourth week of school and nationals is basically right around that seventh week of school. That’s cramming in a lot. You’re playing about 15 soccer games pretty quickly.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79948\" style=\"width: 372px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2028394936\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79945\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79948\" data-attachment-id=\"79948\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/ucsb-womens-club-soccer-shines-in-back-to-back-fashion-win-7th-national-title-with-3-0-win-over-texas/wcsoccer_pic2-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?fit=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"WCSoccer_Pic2 (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-79948\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1-768x1024.jpg?resize=362%2C482\" alt=\"\" width=\"362\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=1122%2C1496&amp;ssl=1 1122w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=840%2C1120&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?w=1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79948\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Photo Courtesy of Jordan Burke</em></p></div>\n<p>It’s a lot to ask not only from the players but from the coaches as well. Heil is the boys’ soccer coach at Santa Barbara High School as well as a club soccer coach, but he manages to balance his responsibilities and keep the team running smoothly.</p>\n<p>“The continuous success starts with our coach, Todd Heil,” Mansholt said. “He has been the coach since the start of this club about 18 years ago. He has built this program from the bottom up and has given this program consistent leadership.”</p>\n<p>While the club team may not get as much academic and structural support from the university as the Division I team does, that doesn’t mean it is on its own. Both Heil and Mansholt made sure to credit the Recreational Sports program for its support of their team and all other club squads.</p>\n<p>As a senior, Mansholt is going out on top. It’s an emotional experience, but she’ll be leaving behind a program with a deep tradition of success and a bright future.</p>\n<p>“I believe this team can continue success into the future by keeping the close bonds we have formed and keeping true to our style of soccer,” she said. “Now that this younger group has a taste of winning back-to-back national championships, I believe they will keep working harder than ever to win another one and keep having a blast while doing so.”</p>\n<p>That ethos of success and hard work balanced with fun is what makes the UCSB women’s club soccer team, and all club sports, special. They might not get the glory of a Division I team, but they’re student-athletes all the same.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Nov. 30</em><em>, 2017, edition of the Daily

hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia. The world’s most watched sporting event is missing usual contenders like Italy, Netherlands, and long-running qualifiers like Ghana, Ivory Coast, and the United States are also missing. In their place, underdogs like Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Egypt, and Tunisia, the most Arab nations to qualify for a single World Cup. Panama and Iceland will make their first appearances in the Tournament, with Iceland being the smallest country to ever qualify with a population less than 350,000. With old contenders rebuilding around new stars, and the presence of some surprising teams, this year’s World Cup might be the most unpredictable in some time. That won’t stop The Daily Nexus though! Here are our 5 boldest predictions for the World Cup!</p>\n<p><em>Russia Will Not Make It Out of Group A</em></p>\n<p>Russia has a rich history of competitive soccer. They qualified for Brazil 2014 by winning their group outright over Portugal. They’ve reached as high as third on the FIFA Rankings in 1996 and their average position in the FIFA rankings, which has existed since 1993, is a very respectable 23rd. Add in the traditionally non-threatening presence of Egypt and Saudi Arabia in the host country’s group, Russia would normally easily skate through to at least a second place showing, if not challenge Uruguay for the top spot. However, no points are awarded for tradition at the World Cup, and Russia will have to earn it’s spot in the knockout stage with perhaps their worst team in history. The FIFA Rankings has Russia at its lowest spot in history this month at 66th. They have not won a single game this year and their best recent result was a tie with Spain, where they gave up three goals in St. Petersburg at the end of last year. To put it shortly, Russia is one of the few teams in the tournament that has been steadily trending downward over recent months. After Egypt’s Mohamed Salah’s record-breaking performance this year at Liverpool, the Pharaohs’ one-man show should be enough against Russia’s porous defense to advance Egypt past the host nation, who may become the second host team to not reach the knockout stage after South Africa in 2010.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>France Won’t Get To The Knockout Stage</em></p>\n<p>France has been raved about in early previews of the World Cup as the deepest team in the tournament. You could even make a competitive squad from the French players, who did not get the invite to Russia. Led by Manchester United standout Paul Pogba, and a veteran captain in goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, France is deserving of its status as a contender this year. Just like they were in 2002 as defending champs or in 2010 as defending runner-ups, when they couldn’t get past the group stage. France is obviously a favorite on paper, but some French media are worried about this version of the squad. “This French team lacks character and mentality”, said Christophe Dugarry after a friendly loss to Colombia. Of perhaps all the major contenders, France may be the team most likely to surprise us all and flame-out in the group stage like they did in 2010.</p>\n<p><em>All 5 South American Teams Win Their Groups</em></p>\n<p>We’ve already touched on Uruguay’s favorable Group A, but do not be surprised if the majority of the groups are won by South American squads. Argentina and Brazil are contenders to win the whole tournament, let alone their group. Colombia drew perhaps the most wide-open group with their only real roadblock being a one-man show in Robert Lewandowski’s Poland and an underrated Senegal team. Still, Colombia, led by James Rodríguez, the leading goalscorer at Brazil 2014, should be a slight favorite to top the group.</p>\n<p>While Peru will be making their first appearance since 1982, make no mistake they are not to be underestimated. The last time they lost a match was to Brazil in 2016! That’s not a bad streak to bring into the Cup and they are easily one of the hottest teams entering the tournament. We’ve already seen France’s penchant for struggling in the groups now and again and if Peru can take care of them, then Australia and Denmark shouldn’t be any more challenging. Even with star Paolo Guerrero sidelined by a doping suspension, Jefferson Farfán and the rest of Peru’s team will continue their hot streak and top Group C.</p>\n<p><em>3 African Teams Make the Knockout Stage Setting a New Record</em></p>\n<p>We’ve already touched on a talented Egyptian squad led by Mohamed Salah, and an underrated Senegal who should only need to beat an unbalanced Polish team to take second in Group H. Nigeria is another squad that has a shot to make it through. They have a solid group, but have had goalkeeping issues with 19 year old Francis Uzoho the likely starter. If he can hold it together for them between the sticks, it possible they could beat out plucky Iceland and solid Croatia. Those three seem to be Africa’s best shot of getting to the knockouts, but crazy things happen in the World Cup and maybe Tunisia or Morocco make some noise. Three squads in the knockouts would be an unprecedented result for African soccer, and while it is a bold prediction, don’t be surprised to see Africa cement itself as the clear third best soccer region behind Europe and South America.</p>\n<p><em>A South American Team Will Win The World Cup</em></p>\n<p>Argentina and Brazil have always been huge soccer powers, but have been lacking in World Cup victories for a while now. Europe has won 3 straight an all-time record, including the first European win in South America with Germany’s dominant run last year. On top of that, South America has not won a World Cup on European soil since Brazil’s win in Sweden in 1958. Here’s why it could change this year. Brazil is highly motivated after last years embarrassment against Germany in the semi-finals and they’re dialed in after a recent 1-0 victory over the defending champs. Messi wants to cement his status as the greatest of all time and perhaps only a World Cup victory will bring that to him. After European dominance on the sport’s biggest stage it’s time stars like for Neymar, Messi, James, and Cavani to reestablish South America as the center of the soccer world. Brazil breaks through for another World Cup championship, while Argentina and Colombia do serious damage in this tournament.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83450\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/five-bold-predictions-for-the-2018-world-cup/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83450\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/five-bold-predictions-for-the-2018-world-cup/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/five-bold-predictions-for-the-2018-world-cup/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/five-bold-predictions-for-the-2018-world-cup/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/five-bold-predictions-for-the-2018-world-cup/","id":1365,"author":{"id":39,"name":"Ryan Hykes"},"related":[1364,1363,1362],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
