He currently serves as the undergraduate representative on the UC’s Student Mental Health Oversight Committee.</p>\n<p>Although he was unable to attend the ceremony in Sacramento, Zohoori said UCSA’s award serves as validation for his work.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong>“It’s so hard sometimes. It feels like you may not be going anywhere,” Zohoori said. “This gives me momentum and knowing that I’m going the right way.”</p>\n<div style=\"width: 3970px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.vash.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/0T7A8119.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Kamran Zohoori</em></p></div>\n<p>After surviving the shooting in 2014, Zohoori began a “period of studying” to educate himself about gun violence. His research directed him to create the “Boys ‘n’ Guns” initiative, which aims to address the relationship between mental health, gun violence and societal pressures of masculinity.</p>\n<p>Zohoori also hosted several workshops on sexual assault and mental health at UCSA conferences throughout 2014 and 2015. <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/frats-address-sexual-assault-masculinity-issues/\">In October 2015</a>, he spoke to UCSB’s Inter-Fraternity Council about a culture of sexual assault within universities.</p>\n<p>“I started to really learn to use my story to do something that I really love doing, and that’s to help people feel more connected,” Zohoori said.</p>\n<p>“He’s done exceptional things, both with his own program and with helping with a lot of statewide initiatives,” said Mohsin Mirza, Associated Students External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) and fourth-year black studies and sociology double major.</p>\n<p>Prior to the creation of the #HowAreYou campaign, Mirza’s office asked Zohoori to participate in forming a statewide student mental health campaign, first known as <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-08-20/ucsa-to-focus-on-letstalk-mental-health-awareness-campaign/\">#LetsTalk</a>.</p>\n<p>“We were anticipating that it would be a big topic in the year to come, but even then we didn’t expect it to be what it became,” Mirza said. “He played a big part in that.”</p>\n<p>Zohoori released his video “Why Do Mass Shootings Happen?” in February, in which he speaks about his personal experiences during the events of May 23, 2014.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe

style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In the video, he narrates riding his bike by the 7-Eleven in Isla Vista when he witnessed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/sheriff-releases-report-detailing-events-of-2014-i-v-mass-murder/\">Elliot Rodger</a> shoot two bikers in front of him. <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-09-10/da-report-finds-polices-actions-last-may-23-to-be-lawful-and-in-self-defense/\">Zohoori hid in the 7-Eleven</a> until he could return home after the shooting had ended.</p>\n<p>“I had a dream that Elliot Rodger was chasing me while I was running along this chain-link fence, and I just woke up right before he got me,” Zohoori says in the video. “It was so fucking scary.”</p>\n<p>If students create a supportive and nurturing environment for each other, Zohoori says the consequences of hyper-masculinity can be avoided.</p>\n<p>“We’re all going through tough times in our life — we’re all going through shit,” Zohoori says in the video. “We need to show each other more support and compassion, just like we did back in May, because with communities like these we’d never feel the need to prove ourselves.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

Following the afternoon discussion in El Centro, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn said UCSB was making the group’s demands a high priority.</p>\n<p>“I think you can tell that we’re taking this seriously because you have a lot of university leadership here today and yesterday,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is a Hispanic-Serving Institution, meaning that more than a quarter of its students are Hispanic. Currently, 27 percent of UCSB students report that they are Hispanic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">“These reforms are for the 27 percent here to keep that 27 percent here,” said Jasmine Ortiz, first-year environmental studies major. “We already struggle coming from our communities to get here and then we have to struggle twice as hard to maintain our positions here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sit-down in El Centro, a building near the library that serves as a meeting place for several Latino student-advocacy groups, was direct and productive, with Marisela Márquez, the executive director of Associated Students, serving as a mediator between administrators and students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Administrators largely seemed open to the students’ demands, at one point remarking that none of VOCEROS’ requests seemed impossible. As the group went through the list, Márquez asked that administrators list barriers to completing the demands as well as solutions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most often, administrators said time and money are the main barriers hindering the completion of VOCEROS’ demands. For example, Maria Herrera-Sobek, the associate vice chancellor for diversity, equity and academic policy, said she was instrumental in creating a Chicano Department at UC Irvine, but that it took more than 15 years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">“It does take some time, but it is not impossible,” Herrera-Sobek said of creating a Central American major and department at UCSB. “You can start right away by having a committee of students and faculty and administrators exploring and identifying the courses that are out there already” that could fulfill the proposed major’s requirements.</span></p>\n<p>Garcia said there is a need for a Central America-specific department and major because Hispanic spaces on campus often focus on Mexican-Americans.</p>\n<p>“Within the Latinx community, we want to break the barriers between communities,” Garcia said, using a term designed to include Latino and Latina students and Hispanic students who do not identify within traditional gender roles.</p>\n<p>“Students feel like the Chicano Department and a lot of the other resources we have are very Mexican-centric,” Garcia said. “We’re not trying to pit departments against each other or trying to get resources from another department, but more-so trying to expand what we already have and be that 100 percent that we want to be.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the groups’ most feasible demands, according to administrators, is the institution of a Latinx Parents Weekend. Klawunn said she would work to add some of the proposed changes into the fall parents weekend, such as bilingual events and workshops oriented toward Latino parents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VOCEROS also had multiple demands relating to campus buildings. The group asked for a guarantee that El Centro would remain a permanent space for Latinx students and also requested that an existing building in Manzanita Village be designated for Latinx students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marc Fisher, a vice chancellor, said the university only plans to make routine modifications to the El Centro building over the next few decades.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can look out 5 or 10 or even 20 years and I can see what the next buildings are, and there are no plans for this site,” Fisher said.</span></p>\n<p>Administrators also responded in favor of dedicating an existing building in Manzanita Village to Latinx students. While housing is already determined for next year, Klawunn said, there could be a Latinx-specific building by fall 2017.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fisher said that while it can be “hard to build community” in Manzanita Village as opposed to the standard freshman dorms like Anacapa or San Nicolas, he didn’t think there would be much resistance to the Manzanita Village idea if that is what students desire.</span></p>\n<p>UCSB Police Chief Dustin Olson also attended the meeting, promising to meet with students and possibly other local police agencies by fall to discuss reducing the “footprint” of law enforcement at events like Deltopia or during Halloween.</p>\n<p>Olson also said the department will “definitely be committed and continue to be committed to sensitivity to gender and diversity” in hiring practices.</p>\n<p>Both students and administrators were willing to work with each other and appeared relieved by the productive nature of the talks.</p>\n<p>“It’s Saturday, we should be relaxing … but I’m here meeting with you all and that’s because these things are very important and these are things that affect people’s lives,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>“At other UCs you have to literally protest for days just to get [the administrators’] attention,” she continued. “So the fact that we didn’t have to do that is a blessing in my opinion.”</p>\n<p>The full list of VOCEROS demands is available as part of the group’s <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/chancellor-henry-yang-voceros-reforms?recruiter=308498257&amp;utm_source=share_for_starters&amp;utm_medium=copyLink\">online petition to Chancellor Yang.</a></p>\n<p><em>[Correction, May 23: An initial version of this article said students met with administrators in El Centro for three hours on Saturday.

<em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The decision to replace Nicoletti’s with Starbucks this fall was made largely due to concern about the finances of the University Center, which is running a near $750,000 deficit since July 2015.</p>\n<p>The UCen’s Governance Board heard presentations from three coffee companies — The Coffee Bean, Peet’s and Starbucks — for the purpose of converting Nicoletti’s into “a national brand,” according to meeting minutes.</p>\n<p>“The UCen is struggling financially,” Travis Taylor, a fourth-year sociology major and voting member of the Governance Board, said, adding that replacing Nicoletti’s is part of an effort by the UCen to reduce its $745,753 deficit.</p>\n<p>“The main factor was the revenue,” Taylor said. “That’s why we even looked into changing Nicoletti’s into a different store in the first place.”</p>\n<p>Nicoletti’s will close at the end of July, leaving at least a three-month gap until Starbucks is scheduled to open on Nov. 10, according to minutes from a Governance Board meeting in April.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70517\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a

id=\"caption-attachment-70517\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Starbucks in Isla Vista (above) will be joined by a Starbucks on campus in the fall. <em>Alex Nagase / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Jillian Stout-Blackman, third-year sociology and global studies double major and barista at Nicoletti’s, said she first found out about Starbucks in the UCen by reading the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>“I was just kind of shocked and confused and I still am because no one really knows what’s going on,” Stout-Blackman said. “It’s just weird that the employees aren’t being told what’s going on.”</p>\n<p>While Stout-Blackman said she rarely drinks Starbucks coffee, she said she would be excited to work at Starbucks because she has heard good things from her friends who work at other Starbucks locations.</p>\n<p>UCen officials say current Nicoletti’s workers will have priority in applying to work at the new Starbucks location, although they will need to go through Starbucks training.</p>\n<p>Peerless, the coffee roast served at Nicoletti’s, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will still be available at other coffee locations like The Arbor, and UCen Dining Services Director Sue Hawkins said coffee carts at the Student Resource Building and Humanities and Social Sciences Building will still be branded as “Nic’s.”</span></p>\n<p>The UCen will have to pay to renovate the new Starbucks location, but Samantha Moon, fourth-year statistics major who also votes on the board, said Starbucks is poised to make substantially more money than Nicoletti’s, although she and other officials declined to specify Nicoletti’s yearly revenue.</p>\n<p>“I don’t agree with commercialization,” Moon said. “But what it comes down to is we need to fix the financial situation of the UCen and this is the best way to do it.”</p>\n<p>Taylor said Starbucks generates, on average, about $1.1 million in revenue per store on California campuses, which he said is “hundreds of thousands of dollars” higher than the other companies’ proposals.</p>\n<p>Taylor and Moon are hopeful this money will help turn around the UCen’s declining financial situation, which they say is partially the result of services like Amazon which have vastly reduced the UCSB Bookstore’s textbook revenue.</p>\n<p>“The UCen should get a lot more foot traffic,” Taylor said. “People should come here more often and Starbucks is a great move in that direction.”</p>\n<p>Taylor said he has worked as a student employee since his first year at UCSB and is personally invested in the success of the UCen.</p>\n<p>“I want to see this building do well because I’m attached to it,” Taylor said. “This is a huge part of the UCSB campus and I think it’s not utilized as best as it could be by students. I hope Starbucks changes that.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, May 5, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nicholas-bogel-burroughs/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>test description</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:sdjklfh@kjasdn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70693\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/officials-new-starbucks-to-aid-struggling-ucen/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70693\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/officials-new-starbucks-to-aid-struggling-ucen/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/officials-new-starbucks-to-aid-struggling-ucen/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/officials-new-starbucks-to-aid-struggling-ucen/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/officials-new-starbucks-to-aid-struggling-ucen/","id":2508,"author":{"id":113,"name":"Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"},"related":[2507,2506,2505],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
