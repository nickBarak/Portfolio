The changes to the psychology degree are a “reflection” of how the discipline has developed in recent years, she said.</p>\n<p>“The change in degree is meant to benefit students, giving them a competitive edge in their further studies, careers and research,” Mackie said. “We wanted to create a new degree more biologically based and rooted in science.”</p>\n<p>The biology courses offered for the psychology department are different than the courses offered for the biology major, she said.</p>\n<p>Mackie said the old degree did not provide adequate training for modern psychology. The changes were not prompted by financial issues. The current psychology and brain sciences faculty are experts in the biological side of psychology, so the university won’t need to hire new professors.</p>\n<p>Some first-year students, however, are wary of the changes.</p>\n<p>Kellie Stahlhuth, a first-year undeclared major, said she planned to get a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology at UCSB and pursue a career in psychology after graduation, but is now unsure if the offered Bachelor of Science degree is the best way to achieve her goals.</p>\n<p>“The other UC campuses and most other universities in California still have a psychology B.A., in addition to the fact that it was a popular degree [at UCSB],” she said.</p>\n<p>However, Carly Wilcox, a fourth-year psychology major, said as she nears the end of her time at UCSB, she would have appreciated a Bachelor of Science degree to diversify her classes.</p>\n<p>“I would have liked the B.S. when I was an incoming freshman personally… but it might be nice if the department offered both,” Wilcox said. “I took Statistics and Math 34A, but other than that the classes for my major have been strictly psych classes.”</p>\n<p>When the old degree was still in effect, the department received approximately 300 applications per year from incoming freshmen seeking a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology.</p>\n<p>This past fall, there were approximately 200 freshman applicants to the new Bachelor of Science degree.</p>\n<p>Mackie recommends all psychology majors, even those who may not be as S.T.E.M.-oriented as others, to still pursue the Bachelor of Science degree because they will receive a more well-rounded psychology education.</p>\n<p>Mackie said students planning on pursuing a career in clinical psychology are given the education they need, while also benefiting students seeking work in medical and research fields.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 12, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Fossil Free UCSB coordinators Theo LeQuesne and Claire Wilson started their meeting with Yang at approximately 3 p.m. Tuesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fossil Free UCSB says the chancellor already “embraces the campaign,” according to a press release Monday, but organizers hope that Tuesday’s meeting will spur Yang to take a more active role.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope that, with his public acknowledgement of support for our campaign, that will have a rolling effect with other chancellors across the UC campuses so that they will also step up and commit to divesting away from fossil fuels,” Celeste Argueta, a Fossil Free UCSB spokesperson, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fossil fuel activists at UC Berkeley staged a similar sit-in just two weeks ago, during which over 20 students sat in Sproul Hall for almost 10 hours until UCPD asked them to leave.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Davis chapter of Fossil Free UC also hosted a sit-in last week on their campus. Student activists initially planned to demonstrate in Mrak Hall during business hours but opted instead to stay the night after being asked by administration to vacate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of the most successful sit-ins have divested from fossil fuels, so why can’t we?” Macy said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fossil Free UCSB organizers plan to remain in Cheadle Hall until Thursday.

due to dry rot, insect damage, steel beam corrosion and an inadequate amount of ventilation beneath the trailer’s floor.</p>\n<p>The project cost approximately $900,000, according to UC Santa Barbara spokesperson Andrea Estrada. Student Affairs contributed $100,000, and the university allocated the remaining $800,000 through the deferred maintenance program.</p>\n<p>University officials originally told students to evacuate El Centro within 45 days, saying the building would either be demolished or improved within that time period. The alarming notice provoked outcry from student groups that use the historical space.</p>\n<p>The university intended to complete the project over the summer, but plumbing complications and changes with university officials overseeing the project slowed the project’s process, said Lorena Alvarez, a fourth-year English major and member of the El Centro Committee.</p>\n<p>“I guess they didn’t realize how many structural issues the building had,” Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>El Centro serves as a gathering space for various cultural organizations, including El Congreso, M.U.J.E.R. de UCSB, Students for Justice in Palestine and conglomerate Mesa Directiva.</p>\n<p>The building is located in two combined industrial trailers and was initially designed to last 10 years, according to campus architects. The building has long outlasted its lifespan, and cultural groups that have occupied the space since the 1970s demand a permanent foundation for its walls.</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the building repairs were slow at the start of the summer due to plumbing complications and when a project manager went on vacation, but progress sped up when Alvarez returned to UCSB in August.</p>\n<p>“Over the summer, you would have seen nothing being done to El Centro, and when I came back in August, you started seeing weekly changes,” she said.</p>\n<p>Former campus architect Marc Fisher, who was one of the lead contributors to the project, left UCSB over the summer to take a job at UC Berkeley.</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the El Centro Committee worked with Fisher until he left and has since communicated with Renee Bahl, associate vice chancellor for Design, Facilities and Safety Services, about the repairs.</p>\n<p>The El Centro Committee was designed to monitor the building repairs and keep an open line of communication between students and administrators. The group meets weekly to discuss the building’s progress.</p>\n<p>“We aren’t architects,” Alvarez said. “We want to make sure we understand what’s happening as students.”</p>\n<p>After a seismic stabilization project that began in February, the university added 12 concrete pillars around the north and east sides of the building.</p>\n<p>These structures made the building more durable and resilient to earthquakes, campus architect Ed Schmittgen told the <em>Nexus</em> in April, and the university opted to repair the building instead of demolish it.</p>\n<p>Some student organizations have been able to use various parts of the building throughout the reconstruction.</p>\n<p>In October, El Congreso was permitted to use the second floor of the building once again, after being unable to use it for the first few weeks of Fall Quarter, Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>Two rooms were also available for students to use as study spaces, and two full time Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) counselors and cultural mentors began using the space to hold office hours.</p>\n<p>The El Centro Committee also received $9,000 from the Associated Students Senate in October to purchase a security system for the building.</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the system will have card readers and make it easier for students to access the building more frequently, even when other student groups are not holding office hours or using the building.</p>\n<p>“We had an issue with students being not being able to get into El Centro because it was locked,” Alvarez said. “Getting the card reader … would be a safer way for them to navigate through the building and get access to the building.”</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the university has been transparent about its work on the building’s progress.</p>\n<p>“I’m really

felt they had a voice in these important issues and establish a mechanism for us to share information to the students about what is happening in this area,” UC Systemwide Title IX Coordinator Kathleen Salvaty wrote in an email.</p>\n<p>The board will consist of one undergraduate and one graduate student from each UC campus, making a total of 19 board members. <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/KP3WLYN\">Applications</a> are due on Thursday, Nov. 30 at 5 p.m., and the selected board members will receive news of their acceptance in January.</p>\n<p>Board members will serve for one year with the exception of board members chosen in January, who will serve a year and a half term.</p>\n<p>According to Associated Students (A.S.) President Hieu Le, he and other stakeholders worked with Salvaty and Title IX Program Coordinator Evelyn Cheng to create the board.</p>\n<p>He added that SAB members will be able to hold decision-makers accountable, as they will be involved in the “procedures, implementation and enforcement of both Title IX and the UC Policy on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence.”</p>\n<p>Le said he was involved in discussing the board’s duties and the qualifications for those who will serve. Board members must be heavily involved within their student communities and have expertise on issues relating to sexual harassment and sexual violence.</p>\n<p>The University of California Title IX Office, responsible for <a href=\"http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/4000385/SVSH\">UC Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment</a>, will seek critical feedback from the board.</p>\n<p>Board members are expected to provide information to their campuses regarding sexual violence and sexual harassment response and prevention efforts being made by the system-wide office.</p>\n<p>A panel of UC Santa Barbara administration members said the board members should be compensated at a town hall meeting that took place on Tuesday, Nov. 14, which focused on updates regarding the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nowUCsbDemands2.0May32017.pdf\">sexual assault demands</a> made by nowUCsb during their <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\">sit-in this May</a>.</p>\n<p>The panel agreed to deliver the message to the administration in charge of the SAB.</p>\n<p>“This is a volunteer board,” Salvaty emailed when asked whether she believed that the students on the board should be paid.</p>\n<p>“I am really looking forward to working with and learning from the student board members.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.7 of the Nov. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.
