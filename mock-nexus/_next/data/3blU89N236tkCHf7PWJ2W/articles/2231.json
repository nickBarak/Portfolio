Users can also report problems with the bicycle through the app.</p>\n<p>The first official steps toward bringing a bicycle sharing program to campus first began three years ago, said Mo Lovegreen, UCSB’s campus sustainability director.</p>\n<p>“A board was formed that included UCSB, the County of Santa Barbara, the City of Santa Barbara, the Santa Barbara Waterfront, SBCC, SBCAG, MTD, the Santa Barbara Bicycle Coalition [and] the City of Goleta,” Lovegreen said in an email.</p>\n<p>The group agreed UCSB should take the lead on the program, include Isla Vista and then expand into the cities of Goleta and Santa Barbara down the road, according to Wagner.</p>\n<p>UCSB then received proposals from eight bicycle-sharing companies looking to set up in the area, Lovegreen said.</p>\n<p>“A.S. Bikes and a number of students on campus participated in developing the scoring rubric for the proposals as well as the bikes, they also test-rode the bikes, and were part of the decision making body for the vendor,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>HOPR’s “no cost” offer was what ultimately sealed the deal. The company said it would shoulder the full cost of the program, which would have otherwise costed the university around $1.5 million dollars for the initial start-up.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84080\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84080\" data-attachment-id=\"84080\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-27/hopping-into-the-new-school-year-hopr-bike-share-has-arrived/hopr-app/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?fit=2048%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"hopr app\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-84080\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=888%2C888\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=1472%2C1472&amp;ssl=1 1472w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84080\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Users can locate bicycles and their “pods” on the HOPR app. <em>Courtesy of HOPR app</em></p></div>\n<p>HOPR signed a three-year-long contract in early May 2019, according to Callie Price, UCSB’s purchasing and contracts manager. The contract can be extended before it expires.</p>\n<p>Each bike normally costs somewhere between $1,500 and $5,000, Wagner said.</p>\n<p>“For dock bikes, there are dock costs, and then there’s transaction fees for the credit cards and maintenance and all sorts of things,” Wagner said.</p>\n<p>The first 1,000 students who sign for the annual membership with their UCSB email – and also qualify for financial aid through UCSB – will receive half the membership money back into their Billing Accounts Receivable Collection (BARC).</p>\n<p>The bicycle sharing program is also an added bonus to a campus where over 1,500 bicycles are abandoned every year.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got a waste problem in terms of abandoned bikes,” Wagner said. “We do sell some of them; the CSOs do a sale at the third week of every quarter in order to put some of those bikes back into service, but usually they only sell a 150 back to the students.”</p>\n<p>“Maybe, as people use more and more bike share bikes, there will be fewer bikes abandoned.”</p>\n<p>HOPR plans to add more than 900 additional bicycles to the UCSB and I.V. area by January 2019, according to Wagner. Eventually, “upgraded” bicycles, such those with electric pedals, will be integrated into the campus.</p>\n<p>“A lot of our students ride bikes at night without any lights or reflectors, or anything else. The HOPR bikes all have front rear lights that activate whenever you ride,” Wagner said.</p>\n<p>“Students are riding HOPR bikes that are well-lit, brand new and are frequently maintained and inspected.

Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The special election comes following the disqualification of Mayela Morales, a fifth-year global studies and Chicanx studies double major, in May.</p>\n<p>Morales won the position of External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) in April. However, she was later found to not be enrolled in any classes at UCSB during the Spring Quarter, according to Gaucho On-Line Database (G.O.L.D.) public records.</p>\n<p>A.S. Legal Code mandates that executive candidates be enrolled in at least six units per quarter to be eligible for office.</p>\n<p>Because Morales was disqualified approximately three weeks after the elections were held, UC Santa Barbara’s A.S. Elections Board mandated a special election to be held for the EVPSA position during Fall Quarter 2018.</p>\n<p>Although Loudon, a third-year history of public policy major, is the only officially declared candidate, potential write-in candidates may join the race.</p>\n<p>Write-in candidates must declare candidacy by emailing the A.S. Elections Board by Oct. 7, John Paul Renteria, the chair of A.S. Elections Board, said at a Senate meeting on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>For the special election, there is still a minimum voting threshold of 16 percent, meaning 16 percent of UC Santa Barbara students need to vote in order for the results to be valid, according to Renteria.</p>\n<p>If this voter threshold is not met, the A.S. Elections Board will extend one week to the voting period.</p>\n<p>If the threshold still is not met after the week extension, the EVPSA office will be vacant until the A.S. Spring 2019 elections.</p>\n<p>A.S Senate passed a resolution in July which split the position’s funds and duties among several individuals.</p>\n<p>Temporary access to EVPSA funds were granted to the External Vice President for Local Affairs, the Student Advocate General, the A.S. President, the A.S. President Proxy, and the Lobby Corps Co-Chairs.</p>\n<p>Their duties will be dissolved “the date that the new EVPSA is sworn-in,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>Loudon was the co-chair of Lobby Corps and served as a policy analyst for the current EVPSA office.</p>\n<p>During the EVPSA candidate forum in April, Loudon detailed her plans if elected into the position, which included securing “state investment” which does not just apply to fighting tuition hikes, but also to getting the State of California to invest in all issues affecting students.</p>\n<p>Loudon added that voter registration would also be a priority of hers. Loudon also said she wanted to increase education surrounding how students can utilize existing mental health resources.</p>\n<p>The candidate forums for the Special Election will take place on Oct. 5, and active campaigning will take place on Oct. 7.</p>\n<p>The voting period will begin on Oct. 15 and will end on Oct. 18, when the results will be released.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

renewable energy sources. <em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p>On Sept. 4, the UC Office of the President (UCOP) announced in a press release that this “expansion of its system-wide sustainability goals” was a part of the UC’s Carbon Neutrality Initiative.</p>\n<p>The Carbon Neutrality Initiative began in 2013, when UC President Janet Napolitano proposed the goal of making the UCs a zero net energy consumer by 2025.</p>\n<p>Along with the 2013 commitment to become carbon neutral, UC now also aims for “100 percent reliance on clean electricity suppliers across its campuses and medical centers by 2025,” according to the press release.</p>\n<p>UC has already saved $220 million by utilizing its energy efficiency programs.</p>\n<p>At UC Santa Barbara, students have been working on the 100 Percent Campaign for the past two years, according to Adriana Munoz, the vice chair of UCSB’s California Public Interest Research Group (CALPIRG) branch.</p>\n<p>“CALPIRG Students have been working very hard to create buzz about renewable energy by talking to thousands of students about this issue and signing them up as members to our organization,” Munoz said in an email.</p>\n<p>“We’ve also worked with other student organizations as well as with faculty to show overall campus support for this issue.”</p>\n<p>She added that the campaign has been a priority due to the effects of climate change on California, which include fires that have occurred close to UCSB’s campus, such as the Thomas Fire, the second largest fire in the state’s history.</p>\n<p>“We are so proud that our UC system is working with students in order to take more steps towards a clean energy future and CALPIRG Students looks forward to working with them on this issue further,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>UC is also committed to not using on-site fossil fuel combustion for new buildings and renovations after June 2019, as well as reducing its overall energy-use intensity, the press release said.</p>\n<p>The UC commitment precedes Governor Jerry Brown’s signing of Senate Bill 100 on Sept. 10.</p>\n<p>SB 100, authored by State Senator Kevin de León, requires the state of California to use 100-percent renewable and zero-carbon electricity sources by 2045.</p>\n<p>“With Governor Brown’s order, California establishes the most ambitious carbon neutrality commitment of any major economic jurisdiction in the world,” a press release from Gov.
