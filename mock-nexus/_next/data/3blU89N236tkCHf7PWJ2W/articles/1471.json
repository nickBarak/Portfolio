This Tuesday at the Arlington Theatre in downtown Santa Barbara, hundreds of fans were given the chance to admire the United States’ current standard of excellence and listen to the inspiring story of a woman who has helped change what the sport of soccer means across the country.</p>\n<p>“Life has changed tremendously, and for a good reason,” Lloyd said about the past year. “Women’s soccer has changed and our team has just transcended the game. We’ve reached heights that have been amazing. I’m still Carli from New Jersey and I still train hard on that, but my surroundings have changed.”</p>\n<p>Though her name may not be the most recognizable in the U.S. behind the likes of Landon Donovan and Abby Wambach, widely considered the greatest male and female American soccer players ever, when it has mattered most, Lloyd has been the one to step up for her country, and it’s not even debatable.</p>\n<p>Since 2008, the United States has reached the final match of the Olympics or the World Cup — the two most important finals the country can reach — a total of four times, coming out as the victor in three out of four of those matches.</p>\n<p>In its three final wins, the U.S. scored a total of eight goals. Carli Lloyd scored six of them.</p>\n<p>Now, for anyone familiar with the sport, it is a well-known fact that soccer isn’t all about goals; just ask any excellent midfielder who has been overshadowed by a forward that puts up better looking numbers than they do.</p>\n<p>In this case though, especially in a country that tends to reward tangible statistics as more valuable than the true impact any player brings to a given team, it is nice to see a U.S. athlete that is both rewarded with, and indisputably considered to be deserving of, the award.</p>\n<p>“What you see is what you get with me,” Lloyd said. “I don’t do it to be cool. I do it because that’s who I am as a person.”</p>\n<p>After a highlight reel of some of Lloyd’s greatest moments opened up the night, the eighth-most capped player in U.S. women’s soccer history with 212 career appearances came onto the stage to an ecstatic reception and was showered with applause throughout the night. After catching the audience up on her latest exploits, including a hat-trick against Ireland just five days ago, she was ready to give advice to the hundreds of young girls and boys in the crowd on what it takes to reach the highest level of soccer.</p>\n<p>“It’s not enough to just practice it a couple times a week. You basically have to do more than the person next to you, and that’s sort of my motto,” Lloyd said. “I train on every holiday — Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving — because I know that nobody else is training, and that gives me the extra edge. You look at every other person in this world that’s successful; Steve Jobs knocked on every person’s door, and the 50th person said, ‘Okay, I like your idea,’ and now everybody here has an Apple product. It’s just about being persistent and working hard towards that dream and goal of yours.”</p>\n<p>Now at the age of 33 and standing atop the world of women’s soccer, Lloyd has cemented her place in the history of the sport. However, as many in the audience found out Tuesday night, she did not have the easiest path to stardom.</p>\n<p>“Throughout my youth days, I was always the best on my team. I practiced a lot, I was super passionate about soccer,” Lloyd recounted. “Then, I get selected for the U-21 National Team, and I was like, ‘Wow, I’m not that good.’”</p>\n<p>At that point, Lloyd went from being the perennial top player on her team to someone who had to compete to get on the field at all.</p>\n<p>“My third year, my coach, Chris Petrucelli, was the first one to be fully honest with me, and he basically told me, ‘You’ve got loads of talent, but you’re not displaying it, you’re not working hard enough, you’re not fit,’” Lloyd said. “That was the first moment in my life that I had actually heard criticism and I was like, ‘What is this about? I’m 22, I’m perfect.’”</p>\n<p>After approaching her parents about her concerns over whether or not she should continue to pursue a career in soccer, Lloyd was lucky to be paired with trainer James Galanis, who had landed a job coaching her brother’s soccer team close to where Carli lived.<br>\n“James basically told everybody that he was going to get me on the national team and turn me into one of the best players in the world, and everybody laughed at him,” Lloyd said. “We’ve been working towards this dream and goal for the last 13 years, and here we are today.”</p>\n<p>Lloyd was then asked to recall her experiences playing for the USWNT, from her nervous first cap to the Americans’ dominant World Cup winning run in 2015 in which she was awarded the Golden Ball for the tournament’s top player.</p>\n<p>The moment that most fans could have expected, and one which Lloyd has surely come to be exhausted with talking about over the past six months, finally came when the 2015 World Cup Final against Japan was brought up.</p>\n<p>After the U.S. fell to Japan in a penalty shootout in the 2011 World Cup Final, the following four years were a journey of redemption for Lloyd and her teammates as they looked to finish atop the rest of the world for the first time since 1999. Thanks to Lloyd’s brilliant first half performance this past June, which saw her not only record a hat-trick through the first 16 minutes, but also arguably the most memorable goal in U.S. soccer history on a chip-shot from the midfield line, the Americans went on to a convincing 5-2 victory.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1CT3xQOfng?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“I remember looking at the clock 22 minutes in and thinking, ‘Just blow the whistle,’” Lloyd said. “When that whistle blew I was just so mentally and physically drained, I just dropped to my knees. You almost just want that moment to pause, because it’s over in the blink of an eye.”</p>\n<p>After years of watching the United States’ No. 10 jersey dominate the world at the highest level of women’s soccer, it was a surreal experience to be seated so close to her that when I swallowed water down the wrong pipe and began coughing uncontrollably, I was faced with the fear that I might distract her in the middle of her speech.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, that either didn’t happen, or she was professional enough to ignore it and continue speaking with a level of class and humility unmatched by any of her peers that I have had the chance to witness. Not surprisingly, one of the most pertinent topics of the hour and 15 minutes she spent on stage was the impact that she and her team have had on the American youth.</p>\n<p>“If I can be a role model and help inspire all these younger generations, that to me is priceless,” Lloyd said. “I want to instill values and things that you should do on and off the field so that all of you young folks watching can pick up on those things.”</p>\n<p>I still remember the first game I ever saw of the USWNT, in an exhibition all the way back in 2007. The men were coming off a disappointing group stage knockout in the 2006 World Cup in Germany, and soccer remained an unimportant sport in the world of sports in America.</p>\n<p>Yet, despite the United States’ lack of awareness for the most popular sport on the globe, I thought to myself, ‘This team is amazing. They could beat the men if they played them.’ Since that time, Lloyd and her teammates, including Wambach, Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan and many others, have helped transform the meaning of soccer in America and prove that it deserves a spot alongside the country’s other major sports.</p>\n<p>Don’t believe me? How about the fact that the U.S.-Japan World Cup Final in 2015 was the most-watched soccer match in U.S. history, bringing in 25.4 million viewers across the nation and 61 million worldwide?</p>\n<p>Or how about the fact that FIFA 16, the latest installment of the world’s best-selling sports game, featured the USWNT’s own Alex Morgan on the cover and gave players the chance to use women’s soccer athletes for the first time in history?</p>\n<p>Or how about the fact that the National Women’s Soccer League, founded in 2012, is heading into its fourth season, surpassing the three-year expiration date that faced both the Women’s United Soccer Association and Women’s Professional Soccer in 2003 and 2012, respectively?</p>\n<p>“We’re now entering our fourth year, which is a good sign,” Lloyd said. “The awareness is good. We just have to continue to sell seats and get people to the games.”</p>\n<p>Thanks to the efforts of Lloyd and the rest of the USWNT, soccer has discovered a new meaning in the United States. Now, the world’s top player and her peers are only concerned with how to carry on with that progress and continue inspiring young athletes everywhere to make their own mark on the sport.</p>\n<p>“We’re really transforming the sport, it just continues to get better,” Lloyd said. “The ‘99 World Cup was a big turning point. The last couple years have been a huge turning point, and a couple years from now when I hang up my boots, I hope it’ll be better than it is now.”</p>\n<p>The young soccer players in the audience who shared Lloyd’s love of the sport didn’t have to look far for the right role model to help them get where they want to be someday.</p>\n<p>She may be sitting atop the pinnacle of world soccer today, but regardless of who she is now, Carli Lloyd was once just a girl from Jersey with dreams of making it big.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67728\" style=\"width: 408px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67728\" data-attachment-id=\"67728\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/carli-lloyd/carli-lloyd-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carli-lloyd.png?fit=2940%2C2607&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2940,2607\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"carli lloyd\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carli-lloyd.png?fit=250%2C222&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carli-lloyd.png?fit=888%2C787&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67728\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carli-lloyd.png?resize=398%2C353\" alt=\"carli lloyd\" width=\"398\" height=\"353\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carli-lloyd.png?w=2940&amp;ssl=1 2940w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carli-lloyd.png?resize=250%2C222&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carli-lloyd.png?resize=768%2C681&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carli-lloyd.png?resize=1024%2C908&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carli-lloyd.png?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carli-lloyd.png?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67728\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tarush Mohanti / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page  of January 28, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Tigers are coming off a convincing 5-2 victory over Elon, the most goals they’ve scored in the tournament in 17 years. They enter with one of the nation’s best records at 16-2-2 overall, 6-1-1 ACC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will be tested on Sunday. I’m excited for this group to show up down in Clemson,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “In my opinion, [Clemson has] been consistently one of the top four teams in the country all year.

The loss was just Clemson’s second of the season and ended a run of nine straight wins and 13 straight undefeated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB has saved its best soccer for the most important part of the year, particularly on the defensive end. The Gauchos have gone undefeated in six out of their last seven games. Their only loss during that stretch came to Cal State Fullerton in the Big West Championship, in a game many, including Vom Steeg, have called their best performance of the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hopefully we’ll show a lot of the same things we showed in the five game streak we had to close out the season and a bit of what we saw against Fullerton. I thought that was one of our best games of the year offensively and defensively,” senior defender Duncan Backus said. “It’s just a matter of putting the ball in the back of the net. Hopefully we find our scoring touch again. We can be a very exciting and dangerous team in the tournament.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the last four games, Santa Barbara seems to have solved the defensive issues which plagued it at times during the season. The Gauchos have found success since moving around a pair of All-Big West First Teamers in Backus from right back to the defensive midfield and sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht up into a more attacking role. Junior Andy Perez has made the move from right attacking mid to right back, doing everything that has been asked of him defensively while still aiding the offense on the break.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were having trouble defensively. I just knew that if we went into postseason bleeding goals like we were, we weren’t going to go very far,” Vom Steeg said. “We’ve controlled almost 70 percent of these games now. It’s been Duncan and Kevin together who have won us the balls in the midfield and this is what’s allowing us to put up 16-20 shots.”</span></p>\n<p>In their second round matchup with South Carolina, the Gauchos controlled the majority of the game before heading into overtime tied 0-0. However, less than three minutes into the extra period, junior left winger Ismaila Jome, who has been hampered with a left ankle injury for much of the season, curled in a brilliant right-footed strike from 20 yards out to notch the most important goal of his career and send his team into the next round.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C6qnyWjgHu4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara will be hoping to have starting goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg back for Sunday’s game after missing the last three halves of play and overtime with a bruised shoulder. The freshman earned an All-Big West Honorable Mention this season and was 13-4-1 in his 18 starts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore goalkeeper Brandon Berke, who started the majority of last season, will fill in once again if the younger Vom Steeg is unable to play. Should the game go into penalties however, the Gauchos will likely elect to go with Vom Steeg because of his extra length.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offensively, UCSB will be hoping to get junior Nick DePuy out of a scoring drought that has lasted four games. The 6’4” forward is currently tied for second in the nation in goals scored with 15 and leads all players with eight game-winning goals. The Gauchos have never lost when DePuy has scored, going an undefeated 16-0-4 when he’s found the back of the net.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That game will, number one, be a great game. But number two, player for player we’ll match them up all over the place,” Tim Vom Steeg said. “You’re not going to get 10 shots in the first half and we’re going to have to do better with less shots, but I keep feeling like the dam is going to break for us. We have 35 shots with 1 goal in the last couple games, so I just feel like we’re due.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be UCSB’s seventh Sweet 16 appearance in program history. The Gauchos earned a first-round bye when they were given the No. 15 seed in the tournament, clinching their 12th NCAA Tournament berth in the past 14 years in the process. It was the seventh time that UCSB has received a seed in the tournament.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the Clemson side, this will be the second consecutive Sweet 16th appearance for the program, making it 24 total in the school’s history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior forward T.J. Casner leads the offense with 10 goals, two of which he scored in last week’s postseason matchup against Elon. That mark is good for third-best in the ACC to go along with his conference-best six game-winners.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a team, the Tigers rank first in the nation in assists at 2.3 a game and fourth in total goals with 48. A balanced attack has seen six Clemson players record double-digits in points this season, compared to four for UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be the first ever meeting between UCSB and Clemson, regular or postseason. The Gauchos will be looking to continue their run for their first NCAA Championship since 2006. The Tigers have two national championships, won in 1984 and 1987. This is their 15th tournament appearance since their title-winning run in ‘87.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everytime you’re in the NCAA Tournament, you’re going to have to hit that one game,” Vom Steeg said. “The 2006 team, we traveled and played the No. 1 rated team at SMU. This Clemson is our game. The fact that we’re playing in that game is where this team needs to be.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos take on the Tigers at Historic Riggs Field this Sunday at 3 p.m. on ESPN3. The winner will face the winner between No. 7 seed Maryland and No. 10 seed Maryland next Friday in the NCAA Tournament Quarterfinals.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66829\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-27/ncaa-tournament-sweet-16-gauchos-travel-to-no-2-clemson/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66829\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-27/ncaa-tournament-sweet-16-gauchos-travel-to-no-2-clemson/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-27/ncaa-tournament-sweet-16-gauchos-travel-to-no-2-clemson/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-27/ncaa-tournament-sweet-16-gauchos-travel-to-no-2-clemson/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-27/ncaa-tournament-sweet-16-gauchos-travel-to-no-2-clemson/","id":1469,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1468,1467,1466],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Strike First, But No. 2 Clemson Pulls Off Late Sweet Sixteen Winner","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_USC_11.22.15_Eric_Swenson_001-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_USC_11.22.15_Eric_Swenson_001-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The No. 15 seed UCSB men's soccer team's NCAA Tournament run fell just short in the Sweet Sixteen at No. 2 Clemson.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_66833\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_USC_11.22.15_Eric_Swenson_001-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"763315608\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66839\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66833\" data-attachment-id=\"66833\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-30/gauchos-strike-first-but-no-2-clemson-pulls-off-late-sweet-sixteen-winner/nick-depuy-attempts-to-header-the-ball-eric-swensondaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_USC_11.22.15_Eric_Swenson_001-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"Nick DePuy attempts to header the ball.

After conceding two second half goals though, the Gauchos were knocked out of the NCAA Tournament by a final of 3-2.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ends another successful season for the program with a 14-7-2 overall, 7-2-1 conference record.</p>\n<p>The Tigers move on to the NCAA Quarterfinals for the first time in 10 years, improving to a mark of 17-2-2 on the season.

A deep cross sent in by freshman forward Cody Gibson was headed back towards the middle of the box by junior midfielder Josue Espana in the 39<sup>th</sup> minute. First to the ball was junior midfielder Seo-In Kim, who headed it home for his second goal of the season.</p>\n<p>Much to the dismay of UCSB Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg, it didn’t take long for Clemson to answer back. Just minutes later, Tiger junior defender Aaron Jones came out of the midfield to beat several Gaucho defenders before blasting in a shot from 25 yards out to beat freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg, giving him the first goal of his career. The crucial equalizer came with just 57 seconds left in the half, sending the teams into the break tied 1-1.</p>\n<p>The younger Vom Steeg, who was making his NCAA Tournament debut after missing last week’s matchup with South Carolina, was put under much pressure in the second half as the Gauchos were outshot 7-4.</p>\n<p>Playing with more possession and control in the second stanza, the Tigers took their first lead of the game in the 69<sup>th</sup> minute off sophomore forward Diego Campos’s fourth goal of the year. Dribbling along the edge of the 18-yard box, Campos fired a shot in towards the top left corner of the net, giving Clemson its second long-range score of the game.</p>\n<p>As has been the case multiple times this season, it didn’t take long for UCSB to respond to its second half concession. Just 49 seconds after going down, sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht intercepted a back pass intended for the Clemson keeper to score his sixth goal of the year and tie it at 2-2. Feucht’s six goals this season were good for second-best on the team in just his first year at UCSB.</p>\n<p>With the game anyone’s to win, it was Clemson redshirt senior Kyle Murphy who ended up scoring the decisive goal to break the deadlock in the 79<sup>th</sup> minute. A string of four straight first-time passes, the last of which came from sophomore midfielder Saul Chinchilla on a perfect cross in from the right wing, resulted in a tap in goal by Murphy from eight yards out to give him eight on the year.</p>\n<p>UCSB matched Clemson with 12 shots on the night, but the Tigers put an efficient seven shots on target, resulting in four saves by Vom Steeg. Meanwhile, Santa Barbara was only able to get a third of its shots on frame, forcing junior goalkeeper Andrew Tarbell to make just two saves in the game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ year ends after making their seventh Sweet Sixteen appearance in program history and 13<sup>th</sup> postseason appearance in the last 14 seasons. They lose a group of seniors that includes All-Big West First Teamer Duncan Backus, starting center back Brandon Brockway, and midfielders Adam Carn-Saferstein and Christian Rodriguez.</p>\n<p>Retaining key members of its core group, including juniors Nick DePuy, Ismaila Jome and Josue Espana, as well as young studs in Feucht, freshman Geoffrey Acheampong and sophomore Ahinga Selemani, UCSB will be a force to reckon with heading into the 2016 season as it looks to get over the hump and make another run for what would be its second NCAA Championship in school history.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66839\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-30/gauchos-strike-first-but-no-2-clemson-pulls-off-late-sweet-sixteen-winner/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66839\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-30/gauchos-strike-first-but-no-2-clemson-pulls-off-late-sweet-sixteen-winner/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-30/gauchos-strike-first-but-no-2-clemson-pulls-off-late-sweet-sixteen-winner/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-30/gauchos-strike-first-but-no-2-clemson-pulls-off-late-sweet-sixteen-winner/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-30/gauchos-strike-first-but-no-2-clemson-pulls-off-late-sweet-sixteen-winner/","id":1470,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1469,1468,1467],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Ready to Ascend to New Heights, Kicks Off Season at Fresno State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2016-08-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WomensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-25-15_8-1-web-e1446002803422.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WomensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-25-15_8-1-web-e1446002803422.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos are ready to build off the success of last years' 13 win season when they open the season today against the Bulldogs.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s soccer team will look to build upon the success it garnered last season, including its co-Big West regular season title, this Friday when it opens the season against Fresno State on the road.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are coming off a solid season in which they finished 13-6-1 overall and 6-2 in the conference with a solid roster filled with a healthy combination of great new up-and-comers and solid veterans.

This isn’t a surprise, as the 49ers return eight starters from last season’s co-Big West title team.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Paul Stumpf, the reigning Big West coach of the year, enters his 18th season as the Head Coach for the women’s soccer team. During his tenure at UCSB, Stumpf has amassed an overall record of 158-142-37 while leading the program to two NCAA Tournament appearances.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are also returning key pieces on the field, including last year’s Big West Freshman of the Year, sophomore forward Mallory Hromatko, and junior forward Amanda Ball. Both Hromatko and Ball were named to the Preseason All-Big West team after solid performances last year.</p>\n<p>Hromatko, a California native, started all 20 games and led the team in goals (nine), assists (six) and points (24), earning her a First Team All-Big West selection, while Ball earned a Second Team nod after netting five goals, tied for second most on her team, and having two assists. Another notable returner is sophomore Sydney Magnin, who started in 19 games for the team last season, scoring four goals and totaling eight points to earn a spot on the All-Freshman Team.</p>\n<p>At goalkeeper, Santa Barbara will look to rely on senior Jacq Caginia, who started in seven games last year and tallied 17 saves, four shutouts, and a 5-2 record while only surrendering five goals.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos hope to reinvigorate that fire from last year, Fresno State will look for a fresh start in 2016 after going 5-12-1 last season, including a 1-6 record in nonconference play.</p>\n<p>It’s tough to start the season against a team that won a shared regular season title last season, but the Bulldogs look forward to the challenge as they return nine starters to their roster and 12 letter winners, including All-Mountain West second teamers Myra Delgadillo and Maria Gomez. The pair of juniors accounted for half the team’s 16 total goals scored all season.</p>\n<p>Fresno State currently holds the lead in the all-time record between the two squads at 5-3-1, but the last time these two teams met in 2013, the Gauchos won in shutout fashion, 2-0.</p>\n<p>Opening day should be a fun one for fans of both sides. The Gauchos, in particular, have big expectations this season and seeing how they respond to those expectations will be entertaining, as will watching Hromatko, one of the best young players the Santa Barbara women’s team has seen in a while.</p>\n<p>UCSB opens the season against Fresno State at Fresno State Soccer and Lacrosse Field on Friday, August 19 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
