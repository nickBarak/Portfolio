\r\n</script> \n<p>Each celebratory scenario serves as a microcosm of the array of past and current African-American MLB players who have contributed to baseball becoming more inclusive and diverse.</p>\n<p>Although widely known for their legacies left on the baseball field, each of the aforementioned former black MLB players were integral influences in black communities nationwide, helping pave the way for African Americans and people of color both on and off the field by confirming that they belonged within “America’s game.”</p>\n<p>This season’s opening day rosters and disabled lists included a league-wide 8 percent of African American players, accounting for a total of 69 black players (via Bob Nightengale, <em>USA Today Sports</em>).</p>\n<p>Helping carry the torch within today’s cohort of black MLB players is Baltimore Orioles All-star center fielder Adam Jones, who has been known to use his social platform to express his thoughts on racial and social injustices.</p>\n<p>For instance, he stated that “baseball is a white man’s sport,” when referring to the MLB’s lack of support during ex-San Francisco 49ers’ quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s protest of the national anthem this past NFL season.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Jones shared his distraught emotions concerning the taunting of racial slurs, which he experienced when he was called the “n-word” and had a bag of peanuts thrown at him in game one of the Orioles-Red Sox series at Fenway Park.</p>\n<p>Since then, various apologies were issued to Jones by Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, the Boston Red Sox organization and others in attempt to reduce the uproar caused by the select Boston fans who attacked Jones Monday night.</p>\n<p>The incident has ignited much speculation regarding the debate as to whether or not all cities are racist or if it is just certain citizens who hold discriminatory and unjust perceptions of minorities.</p>\n<p>Yet rather than seek a solution to this question, the biggest concern is how citizens, fans, the media and players will rationalize the hatred spewed toward Jones.</p>\n<p>The individuals responsible for their ill-advised behavior will rightly face consequences, but the issue at stake goes beyond just placing the blame upon a few “ignorant” or “uneducated” people.</p>\n<p>Jones’s experience was a reminder of the systemic racism that remains ingrained within society, impacting the sports realm as well.</p>\n<p>People critique this institutional structure and question, for example, “Well, if institutionalized racism exists, then why have these players been able to achieve such success and make it to the MLB?”</p>\n<p>That’s just the masking of the root issue at hand. Whether in society, sports, housing, education, jobs or any other industry, institutional racism must be acknowledged. A mutual understanding must be reached regarding the fact that there’s no single, concrete solution to a system that includes centuries of oppression.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, progress in sport has been made since the breaking of the color barrier, but that feat alone was and still is not the final verdict to racism in sports.</p>\n<p>The possibility to combat its systemic presence is plausible and is a work in progress. Both Boston fans and the Red Sox organization deserve credit for applauding Jones in his first at-bat appearance in Tuesday night’s game, while news surfaced on Wednesday that a fan was banned from Fenway Park for using a racial slur against another fan during Tuesday’s game.</p>\n<p>Understanding that this week’s incident won’t be the last of a minority athlete being racially discriminated against is frustrating and somewhat numbing as it is expected. However, it is important for each of us to keep the goal of achieving social justice at the forefront of our societal priorities.</p>\n<p>It begins with each of us individually, yet it evolves when combined with the influence of sports.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the May 4, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

hosted and dropped two out of three games this last weekend to an impressive San Diego State Aztecs team,UCSB junior second baseman Colton Burns believes he understands what has motivated the Aztecs to turn it around this year.</p>\n<p>A former high school and junior college teammate of Burns, junior SDSU outfielder Chad Bible was set to start his first full Division I collegiate season, but on January 10, 2017, just before the season got under way, he was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma.</p>\n<p>“We had this weekend circled on our calendars to play against each other for the first time,” Burns said. “You would never wish the timing of something like that to happen to anybody, but it fires me up to see that the guys over there have rallied around him so well this season.”</p><!--Ad

the junior college level. But even during that impressive season, he says, he could tell something was wrong.</p>\n<p>“I woke up one day last May and had this lump in my neck,” Bible said. “The doctor said it was normal for kids my age to get inflammation there sometimes, so because of that and the way I was playing, I just never thought anything of it.”</p>\n<p>However, more lumps would appear throughout the summer as he geared up to transfer from College of the Canyons to SDSU for the fall semester. Bible even admits that his girlfriend grew annoyed with him during the summer because all he wanted to do was sleep after games.</p>\n<p>Bible’s dad, Mike, also stated that he always had concerns, adding, “It just never felt right to me from the beginning, and it wasn’t until the third or fourth check-up where they said, ‘I think it’s a waste of your time to get another scan’ that I started to believe it was nothing to worry about.”</p>\n<p>Luckily, Bible told a trainer at SDSU, who referred him to the team doctor. Other tests were done, leading to the biopsy in December of 2016.</p>\n<p>Then came the news that he had cancer.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77364\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/san-diego-state-athlete-headshots/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-77364\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77364\" data-attachment-id=\"77364\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/san-diego-state-athlete-headshots/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"San Diego State Athlete Headshots\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-77364\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug-683x1024.jpg?resize=280%2C420\" alt=\"\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?w=1365&amp;ssl=1 1365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77364\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of SDSU Athletics</p></div>\n<p>“I didn’t really hear anything after the doctor said ‘cancer,’” Bible said. “But after they went into detail that I would have to drop out of school, quit playing baseball and move home for treatment, all I asked was that we started treatment the day after playing Fullerton.”</p>\n<p>After getting the reluctant “okay” from the doctor, Bible said, “That was so huge for me to be able to do that and to not see all this work I’ve put in over the years go to waste.”</p>\n<p>Getting a chance to play Fullerton was another contest circled on Bible’s calendar from a long time ago because it was the university that he attended out of high school. He redshirted his freshman year there, then transferred to College of the Canyons, before finally landing himself at SDSU.</p>\n<p>When looking back on it, Bible uses humor to downplay the situation.</p>\n<p>“I got along great with those guys at Fullerton, and I’ve never been a cancer in the clubhouse,” he joked. “But for whatever reason, the coach and I there just never saw eye to eye.”</p>\n<p>Through the first five games of the season, Bible batted clean-up for the Aztecs, eager to prove to himself and his former Fullerton coach that he could play at the Division 1 level.</p>\n<p>On February 22, 2017, Bible went 2-for-4 in a Wednesday night matchup versus the Fullerton Titans, which would improve and conclude his batting average at .318 for the season, as he would begin treatment the next morning.</p>\n<p>With each ensuing inning, things grew more emotional at Fullerton, though few in attendance knew it. Each time Bible stepped up to the plate, his family could be seen taking pictures of each at-bat behind the SDSU dugout, wiping away tears in the process.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs went on to earn a 5-4 victory that night following a save by SDSU closer CJ Saylor, who gave the game ball to Bible.</p>\n<p>Knowing he would be making his way to start his first round of chemotherapy at the City of Hope in Los Angeles just five hours later, Bible received a hug from each of the Fullerton players in line for handshakes. Some he knew and many he did not, but all were deeply moved by his story.</p>\n<p>Bible’s dad recalls the moment as the most emotional one of his life.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t about the logo on your hat or the colors on your uniform that night,” he said. “It was just a bunch of dudes showing love and respect for something bigger than baseball.”</p>\n<p>Bible stated that the prognosis for him is great, adding that the survival rate is 90 to 95 percent. He has already gone through three rounds of treatment with five more scheduled every other week through the month of June.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77365\" style=\"width: 446px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/bible500/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-77365\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77365\" data-attachment-id=\"77365\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/bible500/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bible500\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-77365\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500-1024x683.jpg?resize=436%2C290\" alt=\"\" width=\"436\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77365\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of SDSU Athletics</p></div>\n<p>He says that he has developed hope from athletes who have walked in his shoes before, such as current Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo and pitcher Jon Lester. Both players were diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma during their careers and made full recoveries after their treatment. In fact, Lester was so moved by Bible’s story that he reached out via text during his treatment.</p>\n<p>“I just want to be an inspiration like those guys,” Bible said. “I mean, people can feel bad, and that’s all fine and dandy. But what I really want is for people to see me smiling, fighting cancer or playing baseball and ask themselves, like, ‘Wow, what’s my excuse?’”</p>\n<p>Before the Aztecs began accumulating a 29-12 record this season, a major turnaround from last year’s disappointing 21-win season, SDSU pitcher Dominic Purpura came up with a way to pay tribute to Bible throughout the season in a form inspired by their offseason Navy S.E.A.L. training in Coronado.</p>\n<p>Purpura had dog tags made for both the players and coaches, who each received two tags. One tag is personalized with the person’s name, while the other tag reads as follows:</p>\n<p>“San Diego State Baseball 2017”</p>\n<p>“Family Forever”</p>\n<p>“TG19 DTR,” in honor of the former head coach Tony Gwynn, who passed away, and his slogan “Do things right.”</p>\n<p>And below is a nod to Bible, with his initials and number.</p>\n<p>“Fearless CMB23”</p>\n<p>“To be honest, I just started crying,” Bible said. “It meant so much to know that this fight that I am going through is not all for waste, and I couldn’t thank Dom enough for that.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on

Yang </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/chancellor-yang-promises-fulfillment-of-multiple-bsu-demands/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">promised</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to provide funding from his office for the creation of the office, the hiring of eight staff members — of which Hylton is the first — and $55,000 annually for programming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the creation of the office, Yang said that the development of a Center for Black Student Development, which is meant to be a standalone building, would be “an important priority within campus planning.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands were </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">presented</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the BSU demands team in February and fulfilled by Yang in March but were built upon over 50 years of activism from previous generations of BSU students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hylton was selected after a national search by a committee comprised of members of the BSU demands team, as well as other campus leaders, according to Assistant Vice Chancellor for Student Academic Support Systems Lupe Navarro-Garcia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hylton said she hadn’t heard about the demands before she saw the job announcement, but that she was aware of “some type of forward movement that was happening, as to why this office was being created.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like I’m someone who literally stands on the shoulders of people who look like me, and to be able to be a vessel, if you will, for the amazing work that this institution has done,” Hylton said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students have played such a significant part in bringing this office together.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, a job posting by the Division of Student Affairs described the role of director as an individual who is both capable of overseeing and advising entities — such as the Black Resource Committee and Black Student Union (BSU) — while leading in strategic planning and participating in organizations from the local to national level. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The search committee wanted someone that really understood the diversity within the Black community and really had a commitment to intersectional identities and making sure that everyone that set foot in the place where we have that space, or was interfacing with anyone with the office felt welcomed, seen and understood,” said Meridith Merchant, assistant director for Mental Health Initiatives and Inclusion for Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) and member of the search committee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navarro-Garcia noted that Hylton has worked in various multicultural affairs offices at different campuses and at her most recent university, Lehigh University, grew the office from one person to a full staff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the work that I have done, particularly within higher education, has been around diversity and inclusion,” Hylton added. “Even when I was cultivating those skills in undergrad and graduate, I just always gravitated towards a space like this.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hylton noted that she has worked in advising offices, Educational Opportunity Program offices and admissions offices in addition to her work in multicultural spaces and said she’s looking forward to working with various offices at UCSB to help students in any way they need.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to hold true to the demands that the students brought forth and however that actually manifests its ways, then we’ll actually do that,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, Hylton said she’s focusing her time on learning what exactly the needs of the student are, and how she can help facilitate them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her first few days, she said she spent time getting to know a lot of different people on campus and building relationships, which she described as key to a position like hers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been able to meet, in my opinion, with some really great, great allies, or potential allies, of the space, and everyone seems so excited, which has given me a lot of energy,” Hylton said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, she’s ready to get to work creating a strategic plan for the office and begin hiring other staff members.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navarro-Garcia said they have already hired an assistant director who will begin Feb. 3, and are in the process of looking for an advocacy counselor and an administrative business officer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As OBSD moves forward in filling positions, Merchant said “we have to be very intentional and thoughtful” in making future hires, as to meet the BSU demands and properly accommodate new employees as they arrive on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Do we have space in our suite here for the first tier [of hiring]?” Navarro-Garcia said. “And then we need to start thinking where are we moving to advance to the hiring of tier two and tier three.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a similar sense, Merchant emphasized the need to continue developing OBSD’s infrastructure in an effort to make future employees feel they can perform their job to the fullest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Santa Barbara is not the most diverse place to be. UC Santa Barbara is diverse, but Santa Barbara as a whole [is not],” Merchant said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you’re inviting people to positions where they’re going to be supporting multicultural students, it’s important that there is the infrastructure, so that you can draw people that will feel supported and be able to continue to do the great work that they’re doing,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Hylton, she’s looking forward to doing just that. In the future, she hopes to help create a space where Black students can seek “empowerment, education and inspiration,” while providing them with the resources they need to succeed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s really important that UC Santa Barbara realizes that Blackness isn’t monolithic. There’s so many different variations as to who we are as individuals. And to have this office to a vessel or a conduit to helping people understand what those many different nuances of Blackness is going to be really important.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 23 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>At first glance, Armani Smith, does not look like a freshman. In fact, he is already built like the big-league prospect that he is. Standing at 6’3” and weighing 195 pounds, the young utility baseball player from De La Salle High School was drafted in the 35th round by the Cleveland Indians before arriving at UCSB.</p>\n<p>In his first year, Smith burst onto the scene for the Gauchos, hitting well for the majority of the season while playing solid defense in the field. At one point, the freshman was batting third with an average north of .350. Although Smith cooled down a bit, the young Gaucho star finished the season hitting .285 with three homeruns, 24 runs batted in and 32 runs.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But those are just numbers. Smith’s play goes far deeper than what the numbers say. To simply put it, the kid does not get cheated at the plate. With every swing, even when fooled, Smith would let it fly. At times, Smith would swing <em>so</em> hard that even on misses the crowd would “Ooh” and “Ahh” in amazement. The three home runs hit by Smith were not your typical DI home runs, either. Smith would hit one out to deep right center, to deep center <em>on a line</em> and to left field that would clear not only the scoreboard but also the protective net that shields buildings near the stadium. That ball easily soared more than 400 feet, which is scary coming from a freshman. The kid has serious pop.</p>\n<p>What was even more impressive than his tools, though, was how selfless he was for his team. Smith would rover from right field, to left field to second base while moving around in the line-up all season long. Now, this may not sound like a big deal, but playing several positions while being moved around the line-up is one of the most uncomfortable things for a player to do, but Smith made it look easy. Without a doubt, for all his efforts, Armani Smith deserves to be the <em>Nexus</em> Sports Male Freshman of the Year.</p>\n<p><strong>Lindsey Ruddins (W Volleyball) by Omar Hernandez</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78325\" style=\"width: 278px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/lindsey-ruddins-soars-through-the-air-while-serving-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78325\" data-attachment-id=\"78325\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/lindsey-ruddins-soars-through-the-air-while-serving-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/WVball_vsLBSU-161021-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lindsey Ruddins soars through the air while serving.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins had one of the most dominant individual seasons of any athlete at UCSB this year. The redshirt freshman from Laguna Niguel was a scourge on the offensive end, earning the Big West Freshman of the Year award, which hadn’t been awarded to a Gaucho volleyball player since 2012.</p>\n<p>She received a host of other accolades as well, making both the All-Big West and All-Freshman teams along with notching five Freshman of the Week awards.</p>\n<p>On a national level, Ruddins became the first Gaucho since 2012 to be named to the American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) All-American team as an honorable mention, and she also earned honorable mention honors on the AVCA All-Pacific South Region team.</p>\n<p>The year Ruddins had would be considered extraordinary for any player, much less a freshman. To be third in the conference in both kills per set (4.09) and total kills (389) and then sixth in the conference in service aces per set (.31) was no coincidence.</p>\n<p>It shows only the dedication that Ruddins put into practice (redshirting her whole first year to hone her skills) but also her ability to translate what she has learned into an enormous impact on the court.</p>\n<p>UCSB improved by five wins this season, and a lot of that improvement has to do with Ruddins’s exceptional year. Both she and the team have a lot of room to grow; the Gauchos have never made it to the final four of the NCAA tournament, and she still has three years to work on her game. If this year is any indication, however, we could be looking at one of the best talents to ever play for UCSB and a potential NCAA champion as well.</p>\n<p><em>A version of these stories appeared on p. 8 of the June 8, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78419\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78419\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/","id":1885,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.
