McDonald stabbed and killed the man in self-defense, but was sent to a male prison for 19 months, leading to the “Free CeCe” movement. After she was released from prison, McDonald began advocating for LGBTQ rights on a national scale. A documentary film about her prison experience and activist work is scheduled to be released in 2016 and will star Laverne Cox from Orange is the New Black.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year black studies major Sue Aldaram interviewed McDonald, addressing the moment McDonald was forced to defend herself as well as the overall issues of transphobia and racism. McDonald said her attackers were “Neo-Nazi drunk assholes” who yelled slurs at her and accused her of trying to mislead men about her gender.</p>\n<p>“We have the right to be ‘mad black women’ if we choose to be because look at the trauma, look at the oppression, look at the violence that we face on a day to day basis,” McDonald said.</p>\n<p>McDonald said the prosecution argued her attackers’ previous violent history, swastika tattoo and toxicology report did not pertain to the case.</p>\n<p>“[The attacker was] known for beating his partner, who was one of the people there that night who attacked me,” McDonald said.</p>\n<p>McDonald said she did a lot of “meditating and self-reflection” in and out of prison and listens to Beyoncé because it gives her “solitude.” McDonald said she also finds peace in being able to share her story and promote justice for transgender people.</p>\n<p>“Having a voice keeps me grounded,” McDonald said.</p>\n<p>McDonald said reading the books sent to her by supporters while she was in prison, like <em>The New Jim Crow,</em> changed her experience dramatically and made her “question so much.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65719\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1137920179\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66067\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65719\" data-attachment-id=\"65719\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-03/cece-mcdonald-answers-student-questions-for-trans-revolution-series/mcdonald_riley-esguerra-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1332&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1332\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Riley Esguerra\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1445503321\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"100\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"McDonald_Riley Esguerra-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65719\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Riley Esguerra/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/McDonald_Riley-Esguerra-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65719\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riley Esguerra/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“The things that we were taught, we internalize and think it’s true,” McDonald said. “When will we be able to give our youth <em>The New Jim Crow</em>?”</p>\n<p>First-year music major Jordan Mitchell said he asked McDonald during a question and answer portion of the talk what intersectional oppression she faced within the black community for being a transgender woman.</p>\n<p>“CeCe McDonald critiques with brutal honesty the intersectionality of trans people of color, the prison industrial complex, religious indoctrination in America,” Mitchell said. “She brings her experiences as a light to influence the minds of young individuals at UCSB. She is a voice that enlightens minds of the revolutionary youth.”</p>\n<p>When asked about her feelings on prison reconstruction, McDonald said “there is no reconstruction.” According to McDonald, America takes ideology and turns it into a law then “deems it criminal.”</p>\n<p>“I’d just destroy the shit,” McDonald said. “I’m definitely an abolitionist.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Ph.D. student in feminist studies Chelsea Jones said McDonald’s lecture thoroughly addressed the topic of the prison industrial complex.</p>\n<p>“She covered all the bases beautifully, connecting the prison industrial complex to capitalism, racism, to transphobia, to basically all of us,” Jones said. “She’s a prison abolitionist and not a reformist, and that distinction is super important because you can’t fix something that is inherently fucked up.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article said the discussion took place on Thursday, October 29 instead of Thursday October 22.

Gutierrez called the abuse of detained LGBTQ undocumented immigrants to Obama’s attention, demanding an end to their deportation. On Thursday, Gutierrez will speak on her continued work campaigning for LGBTQ rights and her role as a founding member of Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ and Latin@ communities.</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Ricardo Uribe said students should attend Gutierrez’s talk because the LGBTQ community is often poorly represented by the media.</p>\n<p>“I figured that it is kind of important to hear the stories and learn the other side about people who are not being spoken about or not being represented in the media in order to learn more about their struggles,” Uribe said.</p>\n<p>First-year computer engineering major Melanie Flandes said Gutierrez is an empowering leader who, by sharing her story and experiences, can motivate others to voice their concerns.</p>\n<p>“There are not a lot of people I feel would stand up to the president like that, and for her to have the courage and the ability to do that really does make a difference because now people are going to feel like their voices are being heard,” Flandes said.</p>\n<p>Flandes said Gutierrez coming to UCSB will empower underrepresented communities on campus.</p>\n<p>“Just seeing and learning about her story and how these issues [have] impacted her life gives hope that a difference can be made,” Flandes said.</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Eriko Spurlock said she will attend Gutierrez’s talk in part because she of how much she learned from hearing LGBTQ activist CeCe McDonald speak in October as part of the Trans Revolution Series.</p>\n<p>“I found that these events were helpful in increasing my understanding for the experiences other marginalized women go through, especially since we all have different struggles that we each face based on different factors,” Spurlock said in an email.</p>\n<p>Spurlock said she thinks students should attend Gutierrez’s lecture to learn more about the issues the LGBTQ community face.</p>\n<p>“I feel this event is important for students to come out to in order to open their eyes and gain more understanding for the society, the constructs we live in, and how the current power dynamics are made to marginalize so many people in collectively various ways,” Spurlock said in an email.</p>\n<p>Spurlock said although the topics of immigration and LGBTQ rights are often discussed separately, it is important to see the connection between the two.</p>\n<p>“Immigration and LGBTQAP+ issues on their own are very important to learn more about and understand, but a lot of people think that these two topics are mutually exclusive when the reality is that everything is connected a lot more than we think they are,” Spurlock said in an email.</p>\n<p>First-year sociology major Gabriela Flores said she is looking forward to hearing Gutierrez speak, especially after seeing Shane Ortega, the first openly transgender soldier in the United States military, speak in October, also a part of the Trans Revolution series.</p>\n<p>“I recently attended the one where Shane Ortega came out to speak about his experience as the first openly trans man in the U.S. military, and since I learned a lot from that event, I decided to attend the next one,” Flores said.</p>\n<p>Flores said students should learn more about marginalized communities and support their fight for equality.</p>\n<p>“People need to start paying attention to things like this because these discrimination crimes are only increasing,” Flores said. “We are hurting people in our community by not fighting by their side or hearing them out.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

(SACC) to form one housing student government titled the “UCSB Housing Association.”</p>\n<p>RHA aims to better connect students living on and off campus through collaborative events. If approved by students, the UCSB Housing Association will begin functioning in about five years. It is possible the Graduate Student Apartments Community Council (GSACC) will join as well.</p>\n<p>RHA Vice President of Finance Jacob Johnson said residents could benefit from “stronger” organization and programming services.</p>\n<p>“Week of Welcome could become a lot stronger and more inclusive for those who live in undergrad apartments,” Johnson said in an email. “This change allows greater communication and collaboration with the multiple areas of campus, such as the undergraduate apartments, and I.V.”</p>\n<p>RHA president and third-year psychology major Matilda Mead said the future UCSB Housing Association could provide more leadership opportunities by refining the housing experience for transfer students who tend to be “neglected” on campus.</p>\n<p>“We would be giving them the opportunities for developing leadership experience that come with our title as an association, such as conference opportunities, summer Student Leadership Development training (currently RA and RHA training), additional positions within the RHA Coordinating Board and RHA Councils, and myriad networking connections ranging from within our campus to across our nation,” Mead said in an email.</p>\n<p>Former San Rafael Hall Resident Assistant and fourth-year Asian American studies major Myra Cheah said she favors the change in hopes it will make the transition for transfer students easier.</p>\n<p>“I think programming more heavier, wishing apartments would be great for transfers,” Cheah said.</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Renee Zapata said living on campus has been a positive experience and she wants to see housing-related student government grow.</p>\n<p>“That’s great to see that RHA is able to improve the living experience for students,” Zapata said. “The fact that it is able to get better than it is, is awesome. I don’t see why students would vote against this change.”</p>\n<p>Johnson said RHA wants “everyone’s input” about the potential change.</p>\n<p>“Our organization runs hand in hand with the student voice,” Johnson said.<br>\n“We are proposing this to the students and are depending on their voice on how and if we should proceed.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65967\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/student-residence-groups-to-merge-with-approval/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65967\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/student-residence-groups-to-merge-with-approval/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/student-residence-groups-to-merge-with-approval/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/student-residence-groups-to-merge-with-approval/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-30/student-residence-groups-to-merge-with-approval/","id":2629,"author":{"id":145,"name":"Anna Yoo"},"related":[2628,2627,2626],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
