","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>So I’m now deeply invested in this ABC Family friendly show called Friday Night Lights. Maybe you’ve heard of it, maybe not, but it’s superb. It’s like that old MTV show, Two-A-Days, but without the annoying side swept Justin Bieber-like Alabama hair. That hairdo does not look good on anyone. Period.</p>\n<p>Instead of spilling on the love hexagons that exist in the fabled Dillon, Texas, I will digress and get to my point — my take on the drama that quarterbacks in the NFL.</p>\n<p>NFL teams, like the Dillon Panthers, have a hierarchy of quarterbacks. Unlike any other position  on the team, the quarterback has the most to gain — but also the most to lose. Throughout the history of modern football there has always been quarterback drama. Tom Brady upending Drew Bledsoe, Kurt Warner taking the position from Trent Green, and Doug “Flutie Flakes” Flutie snatching the job from the grossly overpaid Rob Johnson. It is where even the lowest-drafted nobody can upend the first-round picked somebody and become a legend for little boys across America to look up to.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The second and third-string QBs can look chummy and cheery, with their baseball caps clipboards, but you better believe that QB #1 is holding on for dear life to avoid being the next Drew Bledsoe. Because believe me, the way this season is going, there is a strong possibility that the above may happen.</p>\n<p>This 2010 NFL season has been riddled with quarterback controversies. Everyday there is some sort of “breaking news” of QB #2’s outright overtaking of QB #1, QB #1’s injuries (or suspensions) that thrust QB #2 into the spotlight, or, in rare cases, QB #3 or #4 leapfrogging the entire group to grab the reins of the team. Take a look at the starting QBs for Week Three. The names on that list are more foreign to me than Little Ethiopia in West Hollywood. A word to the wise: stay far away from the kitfo. Just do it.</p>\n<p>Honestly though, when did Chad Pennington of the Dolphins turn into Chad Henne?  When did the golden boy, Matthew Stafford, go down with a bad enough of an injury that Shaun Hill had to replace him? Buffalo recently became more irrelevant by dumping Trent Edwards and turning to Ryan Fitzpatrick.</p>\n<p>With all that being said, I am all for upsets. I love the story of the underdog coming from behind to steal the thunder of someone who became too comfortable. Charlie Batch had a very solid outing on Sunday, with three touchdowns and over 200 yards thrown. Fitzpatrick came extremely close to Bundchen’s overall passer rating, with two touchdowns thrown in Buffalo’s closer-than-expected loss to the Pats. Heck, my buddy Shaun Hill had a higher passer rating than Brett Favre.</p>\n<p>Maybe we have come upon a new era in the NFL. Maybe the reins won’t be so blindly handed to the hyped “star QB #1” anymore, but instead be put up for grabs. I am sure that the Peyton Mannings of the world will be the odds on favorites to keep their positions for years to come, and that is justified.</p>\n<p>Maybe for these other teams, such as the Jaguars or the Bills, where the starting QB isn’t so set in stone, there will be that tiny glimpse for an unknown to become a well known. Perhaps it’s just me, but this Joe Schmo decade that we may be embarking on soon isn’t looking too bad.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus sports columnist Julia Speace likes Tom Brady’s Hair. A lot.

It also focuses these resources toward students from low-income communities, with the hope of giving them a higher chance of attending college and becoming productive members of the workforce.</p>\n<p>“We have some serious issues on the planet that must be solved soon, and students with a good education can be positioned to be part of that solution,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p>Ortiz, who graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 1985, originally got involved with the organization as an undergraduate.</p>\n<p>He worked as a tutor for the program during his college years and went on to take a temporary job doing outreach following his graduation.</p>\n<p>After continuing his education at Cal State Northridge and the University of La Verne, he eventually returned to UCSB in 2000 to become EAOP Director.</p>\n<p>“We need more students to participate in higher ed. Our economy needs a highly educated workforce and we are helping that process,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p>When the EAOP was first created, its intent was to diversify the student body of UC campuses by providing resources to racial minorities.</p>\n<p>Over the years, its focus has shifted to targeting low-income, first-generation students who do not have readily available access to college services. The program now spans three counties and soon will be serving 11 high schools.</p>\n<p>“The idea was to increase college enrollment rates from these schools that were usually associated with low-income communities that don’t always have the same resources to prepare for college,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p>With over 2,000 students enrolled in its cohort, the program’s services reach a wide range of students, including those at the middle and elementary school levels.</p>\n<p>EAOP’s welcoming atmosphere is evident through its dedicated staff. Mirka Lopez, a first-generation student herself, works as college-site coordinator for the program.</p>\n<p>“[The EAOP] gives them that motivation and encouragement because sometimes they don’t think they belong at a UC, or they’ve never set foot on a college campus,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>“Through this program they get the opportunity to explore their options and learn what kind of resources there are.”</p>\n<p>The program also has several student interns on staff, allowing UCSB students to serve as role models for under-represented teenagers.</p>\n<p>For Daniel Segura, a second-year sociology major and EAOP intern, the program is especially meaningful.</p>\n<p>“It means a lot to me because I was a part of EAOP myself in high school, so my first experiences with college were through the program,” Segura said.</p>\n<p>“Now that we’re interns, we get to see those effects on other kids, seeing them believe that college is actually possible because someone like them actually made it.”</p>\n<p>However, EAOP has endured its share of struggles over the years, including several budget and staff cuts.</p>\n<p>Staff went from 23 to nine in the mid-2000s, and EAOP suffered additional monetary cuts due to the fluctuating economy, according to Ortiz.</p>\n<p>EAOP began a using new budget model in 2007 that shares costs with its school sites to help run the program. They now use a “Dual Service Model,” aiming resources toward all students, regardless of their indicated college interest level.</p>\n<p>“So in essence, we cover the entire school. We don’t just raise the cohort’s college-going rate, we aim at raising the graduating class’s college-going rates,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p>UCSB EAOP also recently trained UCLA and UCR EAOPs to replicate its model, hoping to impact not only the surrounding community but also the state as a whole.</p>\n<p>The program’s influence was made clear on Friday during a college-readiness event, which gave dozens of low-income and first-generation high school students a first look at UCSB’s campus.</p>\n<p>During this event, UCSB undergraduate volunteers gave tours and provided advice to the aforementioned students.</p>\n<p>“[EAOP] is changing the world one school at a time,” Ortiz said.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Lopez’s first name is Mirka, not Lirka. </em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: UCSB EAOP is training other UC’s to “replicate” its model, not “respect” its model. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

id=\"caption-attachment-84671\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">UCSB Students gathered on Monday and Tuesday to mourn the lives lost in the Pittsburgh shooting. <em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>On Saturday morning, a gunman shouting anti-semitic slurs killed 11 people in the Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh, Penn.</p>\n<p>“It’s sad… and it’s hard to be reminded that there’s something about yourself that people are going to take issue with and that people are going to attack,” Olivia Lazarus, an attendee at Tuesday’s vigil hosted by Santa Barbara Hillel, said.</p>\n<p>Many other attendees shared this sentiment as they gathered at the base of Storke Tower to hear student leaders and university officials address this recent tragedy.</p>\n<p>“[UCSB is] outraged by the violence in our nation and pour out our support and care for our Jewish community here and across the nation, who have been targeted by this act of hate and terror,” UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang said.</p>\n<p>“With tragedy comes the time to stand strong against the fear and bigotry and stand up for kindness, compassion and open mindedness.”</p>\n<p>Chancellor Yang represented one of the many organizations responsible for co-hosting the event alongside Santa Barbara Hillel. The event was officially titled, “Standing With Pittsburgh Against Hate.”</p>\n<p>Miri Klein, co-director of Chabad at UCSB, also spoke at the memorial and was one of the hosts of the “Mitzvah for Pittsburgh” event in the Arbor on Monday.</p>\n<p>“Love and kindness and goodness are like steel. Hate can try and destroy that, but like steel, goodness and kindness will never be able to be destroyed. And all of us coming here together is proof that love and kindness will always prevail,” she said at the vigil.</p>\n<p>Jeike Meijer, External Vice President of Local Affairs for Associated Students, closed the ceremony with a reading of the names of the 11 victims and a song in her native language.</p>\n<p>“I think that you can see how the UCSB community was impacted by how many people showed up today. How many people came, of different groups to show support and stand in solidarity. I think that shows the impact that it [the synagogue shooting] made,” Meijer said.</p>\n<p>For some students, this recent tragedy may influence how they choose to vote in the midterms next Tuesday, Lazarus said.</p>\n<p>”When public officials who are trying to fight discrimination, fight gun laws and try to create stricter regulations, it’s going to make things like this happen less often,” Lazarus said.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it’s going to eradicate it, but it’s gonna make it happen less.”</p>\n<p>At Chabad’s table in the Arbor on Monday, the organization encouraged students to write down good deeds and add them to a board that they plan on sending to the Jewish community in Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Gershon Klein explained that mitzvot, or good deeds, are a way for Jewish people to bring light to the world during times of darkness.</p>\n<p>“A mitzvah can mean different things. One of the main things it means is to be connected… we bring light from the essence of our soul outwards into the revealed world, like right here in Isla Vista,” Gershon said.</p>\n<p>One of the mitzvot Gershon performed was wrapping tefillin around the arms of male students. This particular mitzvah is specifically for men, Gershon said.</p>\n<p>“This is a mitzvah which represents being in the oneness of hashem, God, down into the world. We put it opposite the heart, on top of the head, because often, our heart and our head give us different messages. The whole idea of tefillin is to bring oneness, inside of ourselves and in the world,” Gershon said.</p>\n<p>“So in the place where the biggest friction happens, between our emotions and our mind, we want to bind it and bring oneness to it.”</p>\n<p>Daniel Caduri, an exchange student from Germany, mourned the loss of the United States as a sanctuary for Jewish people. In Europe, Caduri said, synagogues and other Jewish facilities typically have security guards.</p>\n<p>“In the U.S. it was actually quite opposite. When you go there, everything’s open, you can just enter the room because there was no fear of danger so far. So I don’t know how it will change now,” he said.</p>\n<p>“I hope that America will [still] remain a safe place.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84669\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-students-come-together-to-mourn-the-lives-lost-at-the-synagogue-in-pittsburgh/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84669\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-students-come-together-to-mourn-the-lives-lost-at-the-synagogue-in-pittsburgh/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-students-come-together-to-mourn-the-lives-lost-at-the-synagogue-in-pittsburgh/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-students-come-together-to-mourn-the-lives-lost-at-the-synagogue-in-pittsburgh/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-students-come-together-to-mourn-the-lives-lost-at-the-synagogue-in-pittsburgh/","id":2210,"author":{"id":33,"name":"Isabell Liu"},"related":[2209,2208,2207],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Title IX Policy Changes Explained By Student Advisory Board Representative","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-10-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SENATE_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SENATE_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UC-wide sexual violence and sexual harassment policy is currently in a formal review period.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em>Update [Nov. 19]: UCOP later contested the validity of Selvidge’s statements.

Senate on Wednesday, highlighting the specific changes and non-changes to the policy.</p>\n<p>The UC-wide sexual violence and sexual harassment policy is currently in a formal review period.</p>\n<p>The policy previously stated that all graduate students were mandatory reporters of any sexual harassment or violence. Now, graduate students are only mandatory reporters when “we’re in our capacity as an employee,” Selvidge said.</p>\n<p>“We are not particularly well trained in this,” she said. “We have sort of a one-hour… online training that covers explanations of all of sexual violence, all of sexual harassment, stalking, dating and domestic violence … It’s really not enough to have us understand how to respond sensitively.”</p>\n<p>Selvidge emphasized that all other student employees who are paid by the university remain “responsible employees,” meaning they are required to report to the Title IX office in the event that they become aware of sexual violence or harassment committed against another student while they are acting as employees.</p>\n<p>Selvidge also discussed changes to the definition of consent. The committee now defines consent as “unable to understand the…nature of sexual activity due to…alcohol and drugs.”</p>\n<p>The policy’s change says the student would need to be incapacitated for consent to be questioned, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the formal investigation time period has been increased from sixty calendar days to ninety business days.</p>\n<p>She explained the change stemmed from the university, stating they have struggled with finding enough time to complete investigations within the sixty 60 calendar day time restraint limit in the past.</p>\n<p>The student’s decision of whether or not they want a formal investigation is now not a determining factor of whether they actually get a formal investigation, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>“The university will investigate things without people’s consent,” Selvidge said.</p>\n<p>Another aspect of the Title IX policy that Selvidge outlined in her presentation was in regards to the sexual assault of minors.</p>\n<p>UCSB does not consider statutory rape to be sexual assault, according to Selvidge. She pointed out that the university is trying to keep in mind 17-year-olds and their dating life.</p>\n<p>However, several graduate students at the GSA meeting expressed their concern for their own children living on campus. It worried them that the university does not see the possible rape of their children as sexual assault, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>Selvidge also discussed the new revision to the definition of sexual assault penetration and contact, which now includes language that is more inclusive toward the LGBTQ+ community, as well as male victims.</p>\n<p>“I am actually very happy with this particular change. This is something that I worked on convincing them for several years,” Selvidge said.</p>\n<p>Power imbalances, such as the dynamic between a teacher assistant and a student, are now taken into consideration as aggravating circumstances in the new policy, according to Selvidge.</p>\n<p>Relationship violence has also been expanded to include non-physical conduct such as the abuse of a pet or the destruction of property.</p>\n<p>The Title IX Student Advisory Board consists of one undergraduate and one graduate student from each UC campus, making a total of 19 board members.</p>\n<p>Currently, the undergraduate position for UCSB is vacant. Students who are interested should contact Ariana Alvarez, the Title IX Officer for UCSB.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84299\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84299\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/","id":2211,"author":{"id":64,"name":"Aaron Berkness"},"related":[2210,2209,2208],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
