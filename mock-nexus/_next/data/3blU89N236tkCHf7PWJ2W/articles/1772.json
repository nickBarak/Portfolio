She initially started the account, which boasts 55 followers, to showcase the training progress of her guide dog, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In high school, I was raising and training Lane to be a guide dog  and wanted to give people some insight as to what that process looked like,” Nelson explained. She said the account was “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for others and myself to document my journey with him.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, Olivia Chung, a second-year psychological and brain sciences major, saw her dog Oreo’s Instagram profile, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/oreothewirefox/\">@oreothewirefox</a>, as a unique way to bond with her wire hair fox terrier.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We spend a lot of time together anyways, but we get to spend this time [taking] pictures, and it’s fun to think of creative pictures and different scenery,” Chung said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chung has maintained the profile for nearly four years and has amassed 65 followers so far. She said she uses the profile to “keep my pictures of him in one place and also share with my friends and family who haven’t gotten to see him in-person and who live far away.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kat Williams, a fourth-year history of art and architecture major, began documenting her dogs, Boone and Ohana, as soon as she got them nine months ago. Williams said she was inspired to create <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/booneandohana/\">@booneandohana</a> because of her dogs’ cuteness and photogeneity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The job of running an Instagram dedicated to a pet may seem easy, but Williams said there’s always “the pressure for everything to look nice, have a defined ‘aesthetic’ and post frequently.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While she has felt pressure to always have her phone out to take the ideal photo of Ohana, Williams said she has learned to “not agonize over every picture being perfect.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olivia Bernheimer, a fourth-year sociology major, has seen considerable growth on her cat Cleopatra’s Instagram, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cleothe_kitty/\">@cleothe_kitty</a>, over the last six months. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She has over 100 followers, which is way more than I ever expected,” Bernheimer said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After watching a documentary about the mysterious phenomenon of internet cat famedom, Bernheimer became acquainted with some of the most influential instagram cats, including </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@fatcathercules and @iamlilbub.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All this is very silly, but that is what makes it so fun,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While coming up with creative captions proves difficult at times, “seeing that people love my cat as much as me” makes all of the work worth it, Bernheimer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I like to celebrate her. She brings so much to my life that I want to share it with the world.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But some pet owners are finding difficulty in sorting through all the pictures they take of their pets to find the perfect one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matthew Griffin, a fourth-year political science major and the owner of a golden retriever named Jeter, said that he sorts “through the thousands of pictures I have of Jeter in order to pick the best ones.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He initially made a profile for Jeter after seeing how friendly he was with his family, friends and people in the neighborhood. Griffin said Jeter’s Instagram profile, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jeter_thegoldenretriever/\">@jeter_thegoldenretriever</a>, was actually inspired by another pair of golden retrievers, Camper and Honey, whose owners operate the successful profile @camperandhoney.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Samantha Stackelhouse, the owner of a long-haired teacup chihuahua named Max, was inspired to create Max’s Instagram after strangers came up and asked if Max had a profile online. After experiencing this time and time again, Stacklehouse took it upon herself to create an Instagram account for Max. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The account, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/max.the.fluffy.dog/\">@max.the.fluffy.dog</a>, has been active for four years, Stackelhouse said. The best part is “people seeing him in public and after meeting him, immediately following his Instagram,” she added. “It’s really cute to see how people react over him.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the account’s growth, Max’s Instagram profile hasn’t achieved the level of stardom that others have, but she still enjoys putting out photos for those close to her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Though [Max is] not Instagram famous, a lot of his followers consist of our family and extended friends,” Stacklehouse said. “I think people like to see a break in their feed of a really cute dog instead of social media drama or bad news.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94304\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-04/the-furry-faces-behind-ucsbs-pet-community/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94304\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-04/the-furry-faces-behind-ucsbs-pet-community/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-04/the-furry-faces-behind-ucsbs-pet-community/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-04/the-furry-faces-behind-ucsbs-pet-community/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-04/the-furry-faces-behind-ucsbs-pet-community/","id":1772,"author":{"id":19,"name":"Alexandra Leal Silva"},"related":[1771,1770,1769],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":19,"name":"Alexandra Leal Silva","biography":"Not available","articles":[1772,1942,1964,3512,7898],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Competes at Big West Championships","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Cross Country","publish_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB performed well at the Big West Championships this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This Saturday marked the day of the 2013 Big West Championships held in San Luis Obispo, where both the men’s and women’s cross country teams would compete for UCSB. Cal Poly provided the venue for this contest at the Fairbanks Memorial Cross Country Course, a very rugged and hilly route.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women, led by junior Dani Moreno, were able to take third place in the contest out of the nine teams with a score of 62. The men managed to sneak into the second spot on the poll and claim silver with a score of 49. Both of the Cal Poly teams took the number one spot as Big West Champions.</p>\n<p>Moreno (21:56.2) and junior Christine Cooperstein (21:59.7) landed themselves in the third and fourth spots at the finish of this race, coming in only three seconds apart and making a huge contribution to the Gauchos’ score for the 6K run.

Some of the girls we needed to see step up did and that’s what I asked for.”</p>\n<p>The men’s 8K race took an upwards turn in the face of the Big West rankings that listed UCSB as the third-best team and predicted such a performance of the Gauchos. Dolan claimed that if the team did come in third, it would be a surprising disappointment.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara would not disappoint as it went out and grabbed second place overall in the Big West on Saturday. The team was led in a similar fashion as the women, when sophomores Bryan Guijarro (25:39.0) and Anthony Ortolan (25:42.8) finished sixth and seventh, while junior Bryce Rausa (26:02.6) followed shortly behind and took ninth. Of the nine UCSB competitors, six placed in the top 20 to clinch first runner-up.</p>\n<p>“These guys are good and they improved so much over the summer,” Dolan explained. “Cal Poly had the horses today and we knew they would be a tough team to beat, so being in second really is what we knew we would be battling for, and we accomplished that [Saturday].”</p>\n<p>With the regular season behind them and both teams placing on the podium, the Gauchos will look to send their stars to the NCAA West Regionals in Sacramento on Nov. 14.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52761\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/ucsb-competes-at-big-west-championships/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52761\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/ucsb-competes-at-big-west-championships/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/ucsb-competes-at-big-west-championships/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/ucsb-competes-at-big-west-championships/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/ucsb-competes-at-big-west-championships/","id":1770,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[1769,1768,1767],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Cross Country Places Fifth at West Regionals","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Cross Country","publish_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"At the NCAA West Regional in Eugene, Oregon on Saturday, UCSB cross country ran well against the best teams from the west.
