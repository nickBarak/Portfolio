The building was deemed unstable in 2017 due to various structural problems, promting students and alumni to call for its repair and the preservation of its history. <em>Kaitlyn Ngyuen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>El Centro, which sits on sunken ground between the library and Broida Hall, has historically been a gathering place for Latinx students and activists. The building provides working space for campus organizations including M.U.J.E.R. de UCSB, El Congreso, Students for Justice in Palestine and the conglomerate Mesa Directiva.</p>\n<p>The reconstruction cost approximately $900,000, funded by Student Affairs and partially funded by the deferred maintenance program.</p>\n<p>In January 2017, occupants of the building received a 45-day vacate notice after a report from the Van Sande Structural Consultant group confirmed various structural issues including insect infestation, poor ventilation and structural damage that made the building highly unstable in the event of an earthquake.</p>\n<p>After the eviction notice, students and alumni voiced their frustration toward the administration for seemingly ignoring the requests of the occupants to repair the building, according to Shahryar Mooraj, a fourth-year mathematical science and physics double major and member of the El Centro Committee.</p>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/senate-passes-resolution-to-preserve-el-centro-building/\">passed a resolution</a> a few weeks later that supported the restoration of the building and by April 2017 the administration had decided against the demolition of the historic building.</p>\n<p>A committee of students and administrators was then created to discuss the conditions of the new building and to discuss what was needed.</p>\n<p>“As students, we came together to stop that and to fight for the history and the culture that has been built in that space over time and to ensure that El Centro has a permanent physical space on campus,” Mooraj said.</p>\n<p>The space was created as a response to the lack of representation and support from the UCSB administration for the Latinx community, which additionally led to the creation of the Chicana/o Studies department and support programs like EOP, according to Mooraj.</p>\n<p>A 10-day hunger strike by Chicanx student activists in 1994 pushed the UCSB administration to make El Centro a permanent space after the trailer had been given a life-span of 10 years and had not been considered a permanent building.</p>\n<p>“The space of El Centro was allocated in the late ’70s, early ’80s to give students of color a place to congregate, a place to meet where they could feel welcomed on campus during a time when that really wasn’t the case,” Mooraj said.</p>\n<p>“Since then, it’s been a center for community organizing and activism in terms of fighting for different things that students need,” he added.</p>\n<p>According to Mooraj, students at El Centro continually fought for the permanency and improvement of the building, including insect and mold inspections and requests for a hydration station, which was eventually installed late 2016.</p>\n<p>According to UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada, the entire portion of the building that was previously a trailer was remodeled, except for the wood stud walls and plywood siding and the wood roof rafters and plywood roofing.</p>\n<p>The trailer now has a concrete foundation, a drainage system to prevent flooding during the rainy season and new wiring that improves the lights and Wi-Fi connection in the building.</p>\n<p>Mooraj said that some offices were remodeled to create a conference room and a kitchen. Ten feet of space was also added to the main activity room.</p>\n<p>New furniture, monitors and salvaged art pieces from the original building now adorn the reconstructed student hub.</p>\n<p>According to Mooraj, the new building is expected to be a permanent location for El Centro, and there will be regular upkeep and maintenance.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara’s Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and Early Academic Outreach Program are currently operating from the building. A psychologist from Counseling and Psychological Services will also be accessible on the first floor of the building.</p>\n<p>“We have a signed agreement with the Chancellor and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and other administration that El Centro will be a permanent physical space and that it will remain where it is today,” Mooraj said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on

Azulejos, Mexico City. <em>Courtesy of Osiris Gómez</em></p></div>\n<p>In an interview with the Nexus, Gómez said he hopes the event will challenge traditional conference dynamics of “subject and observer.”</p>\n<p>Gómez said he hopes to break these boundaries by removing the limitations of a traditional conference by creating a bridge between western academia to alternative cultural knowledge.</p>\n<p>He said this can reshape the assumptions of oral indigenous traditions and the way literary scholars currently perceive collective knowledge and oral histories.</p>\n<p>According to Gómez, transcending traditional conference settings will connect western academia to the non-academic work that indigenous people do in everyday sacred practices.</p>\n<p>A year after sending out a “Call for Papers,” which invited indigenous and native scholars to submit literary work and art to be shared at the conference, Gómez hoped to catch the attention of community leaders, artists and activists from different universities both here and abroad.</p>\n<p>He now hopes the conference will explore how minority cultures are “revising their knowledges and epistemological sources through poetic art.”</p>\n<p>In 2016, Gómez conducted research in Mexico for a dissertation about native languages and the sociopolitical movements for their revival.</p>\n<p>After meditating on his research results, Gómez said he realized this was the start of conceptualizing this first indigenous writers conference.</p>\n<p>“Quiero crear conciencia,” Gómez said, meaning “I want to create consciousness.” Gomez hopes to create a “conscious dialogue” that places value in each authors’ respective native cultures and languages.</p>\n<p>The conference will also challenge the terminology surrounding indigenous cultures, including the word “indigenous” itself, when analyzed and studied within western academia.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to include people that live what we’re trying to understand here… We’re here to learn from everyone and to learn from experience,” Gómez said.</p>\n<p>According to the conference’s mission statement, Verbal Kaleidoscope will explore the resistance that “lies in the throats of these literary voices that proclaim cultural self-determination.”</p>\n<p>These literary voices “will echo a worldwide literary and social movement” that is fighting for the survival of indigenous territories and peoples.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

email from what looked like the school, and it directed me to a link,” Padilla said. “Of course I was going to open it because I’m always on the lookout for emails from professors or anything campus-related.”</p>\n<p>A few days after clicking the link, Padilla received at least 3,000 emails and 40 Facebook messages regarding the false job offer, most of them from people asking for more information and even sending full resumes.</p>\n<p>Like Padilla, many UCSB students can suffer from these scams when they mistake faulty emails for official university announcements.</p>\n<p>Phishing is a form of social engineering that takes place through email with the ultimate goal of acquiring someone’s personal information, according to Sam Horowitz, UCSB’s chief security information officer.</p>\n<p>Despite posting a warning on UCSB’s “Free &amp; For Sale” page on Facebook and having UCSB’s Student Information Systems and Technology help reset her U-Mail information, Padilla says she still occasionally gets spam and emails relating to the scam.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t satisfied with the help desk. They reset my U-Mail, and I tried to show them that I was still getting spam, but it seemed like they didn’t believe me. They were helpful in resetting but even then I’m still wondering how our security is so compromised,” she said.</p>\n<p>Horowitz explained that there is little the help desk can do when someone falls victim to a phishing attack.</p>\n<p>“If you respond to a phishy message, they’re going to send you more messages because they know you respond. The help desk can’t fully prevent when the student declared themselves to be a soft target,” he said.</p>\n<p>Horowitz said that there is no clear answer as to how scammers obtained U-Mail information since some technology is untraceable and there are limitations to detecting online activity.</p>\n<p>He said, however, that possibilities could include leaks through students’ distribution mailing lists or computer malware.</p>\n<p>“The best way to tell if an email is a phishing scam is that if it expresses any sort of urgency or threat,” Horowitz said. “If it’s too good to be true, or if it’s really urgent and threatens, be circumspect about it. Have a skeptical mind to recognize when you’re being fooled. Students need to look out all the time.”</p>\n<p>Shea Lovan, associate director of UCSB’s Enterprise Technology Services, said that while he does not have phishing-specific statistics, “Office 365 blocks an average of 2.7 million pieces of spam and just under 5,000 pieces of malware destined for U-Mail accounts every month.”</p>\n<p>Phone call scams claiming ransom have also been targeting students and citizens throughout Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>Large reports of phone calls involving IRS impersonators and virtual kidnapping instances are on the rise, according to a press release from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO).</p>\n<p>Virtual kidnapping scams involve contacting a family member and claiming to have kidnapped someone close to them before demanding ransom payment.</p>\n<p>“The best way to combat these calls is to educate the public,” SBSO spokesperson Kelly Hoover said.</p>\n<p>“Anytime we send information out about these phone scams, it appears that it scares off the scammers for a time before they flare back up again,” she added.</p>\n<p>To avoid falling victim for phone scams, Hoover advises to simply hang up the phone.</p>\n<p>“If anybody calls you claiming to be from any agency and asks you for financial information or mentions that you owe something, just hang up and call the agency to make sure that this person is legitimate,” she said.</p>\n<p>If students have been victims of phishing, they should visit <em>security.ucsb.edu</em> to report the issue.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 3 of the April 12, 2018

Bike shop. The total cost of the project and sources of funding are still undetermined. Irene Chen / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“I think this project is transformational in its scope,” said Mark Nocciolo, director of capital development at UC Santa Barbara. Nocciolo has overseen early renovation plans and worked with the architect and Associated Students (A.S.) to help visualize the project.</p>\n<p>“The intent is to try to redefine the University Center to be less like a mall and more like a student union. Anybody who has been to any Division 1 campus would recognize that there’s usually a university center that’s more student-oriented than ours is,” he explained.</p>\n<p>The model was developed by Nocciolo and Jean Gaff, managing principal of Pfeiffer Architects.</p>\n<p>The plans radically change and “revitalize” the University Center (UCen) into a “NewCen,” according to A.S. President Hieu Le.</p>\n<p>“Today’s Student Affairs’ (S.A.) service needs substantially exceed the capacity of S.A. facilities, compromising functionality, collaborations and staff and student well-being,” Le said.</p>\n<p>The renovated UCen would include a new “innovation lab” where students could collaborate on projects, a “demonstration kitchen” in which chefs would offer cooking lessons and connectivity kiosks, in which students tabling for their organizations would have a space to set up shop.</p>\n<p>These features are in addition to elements previously described on the project’s ballot measure, such as expanded space for the A.S. Food Bank, Campus Learning and Assistive Services (CLAS) and Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.).</p>\n<p>The 3D model additionally projects an expanded Wellness Center, which currently exists inside Student Health. As <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/stagnant-2-million-fund-could-offset-ucen-project-costs-fees-will-still-rise-after-inflation/\">previously reported</a>, the building would also include a migrated A.S. Bike Shop.</p>\n<p>The project would also include a new “pedestrian zone” adjacent to the building, which would allow more space for people walking through on campus tours.</p>\n<p>Several areas of the current UCen, such as the bookstore, Starbucks and some of the food areas, will remain in business throughout construction, Le said.</p>\n<p>Since the project was first proposed, students have disputed how much it would <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/\">actually cost</a>, while information about the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/broken-outdated-pipes-to-blame-for-ucen-smell/\">state of the current UCen</a> and Le’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/petition/\">petitioning methods</a> have been controversial topics across the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>If students vote to pass the project, student fees will be increased $20.40 per quarter from Fall 2018 until Fall 2022. From Fall 2022 to Fall 2052, students will pay an additional $96.06 per quarter.</p>\n<p>Funding for the project will come from a combination of alumni donations, student fees and the university itself, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“At this current state we don’t know [exactly how much people will pay] because there are a lot of factors, such as donations,” he said.</p>\n<p>This is the third time an A.S. president has created a UCen renovation plan. During the 2013-14 school year, then-President Jonathan Abboud developed a similar plan that would have expanded space in the UCen to allocate more space to campus services. The plan failed on the spring ballot.</p>\n<p>Another failed UCen renovation, proposed in 2011, would have expanded third-floor study space. In 2012, then-President Harrison Weber created a plan for an entirely new building, a Student Engagement Center. Students voted down the fee initiative in the spring election.</p>\n<p>While the organization of different spaces has varied in the different UCen plans, the concept has remained fairly consistent, Nocciolo said.</p>\n<p>He noted that the latest renovation project differs from the previous ones because it addresses infrastructural problems that are reportedly plaguing the facility.</p>\n<p>Students will vote on this project in April 23-26. If it passes, planning likely will begin immediately, according to Le.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the April 12, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
