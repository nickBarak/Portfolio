During the event, Lebecki presented photojournalist Cory Richards’ documentation of the expedition and recounted the details of climbing in below-freezing temperatures, traversing unusually sharp rocks and taking shelter from extreme wind.</p>\n<p>Lebecki said the expedition had an aura of excitement before it began due to the location and height of Bertha’s Tower, which looks like a sharp spike of rock.</p>\n<p>“This particular expedition felt like it would be the biggest one of our lives,” Lebecki said.<br>\nLebecki said the jutting rock looked like a foreign planet.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really alien landscape; we could have been looking at Mars,” Lebecki said.</p>\n<p>According to Lebecki, his team was delayed three weeks shortly after the trip began due to heavy winds ranging from 40 to 80 mph. Lebecki said when the crew finally arrived at the base of the tower, the heavy winds continued to make travel difficult.</p>\n<p>“The weather [in Antarctica], it’s raw and it’s brutal and it just beats the shit out of you,” Lebecki said.</p>\n<p>Lebecki said although the team had originally planned to travel by kite skiing, the strong winds pulled kites out of the explorers’ hands. Lebecki said the slick, wind-polished ice made hand skiing impossible, forcing the team to walk using spiked boots. The sharp rocks on Bertha’s Tower raised concerns of cut ropes if someone fell, making trust a primary requirement for the expedition, according to Lebecki.<br>\n“We were all putting our lives in somebody’s hand,” Lebecki said.</p>\n<p>According to Lebecki, the crew made camp and began preparing for their final push toward the peak after scaling 1,200 feet and placing anchors in the tower’s face. Lebecki led the final push to the summit.<br>\n“All of my experience for the last 20 years was for this moment,” Lebecki said.</p>\n<p>Lebecki said the panoramic views from the camera were breathtaking, but the team could only stay for twenty minutes before it was necessary for them to begin rappelling back down.</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Matthew Edmiston said the whole expedition was difficult to imagine.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know how he did it, how he got the rope up there; it was like a flying city, with him and his crew and his gear, I don’t know how he got it all up there,” Edmiston said.</p>\n<p>Lebecki’s mother Charlotte said she admires her son’s profession.</p>\n<p>“Every story is new to me and I just love hearing it and seeing it, especially the videos are just breathtaking,” Charlotte Lebecki said. “I am in awe of what he does, and I feel very fortunate to see what he sees.”</p>\n<p>First-year environmental studies major Marissa Rajczi said it was inspiring to hear about Lebecki’s experiences, having recently experienced the difficulty of climbing.</p>\n<p>“It was especially exciting to hear Mike’s first-hand account of his Antarctic expedition given that yesterday I went outdoor free climbing for the first time,” Rajczi said. “I could appreciate the mental and physical stamina it must have taken him to complete such a climb, and found myself in awe as I related my own experiences to his.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Associate Professor of Sociology at Indiana University Dina Okamoto gave a lecture titled “Asian American Panethnicity and Shifting Ethnic Boundaries” Thursday at the MultiCultural Center (MCC) to discuss Asian-American identity throughout history.</p>\n<p>Okamoto spoke about Asian ethnic groups in the United States and how various social and cultural forces led to the creation of the panethnic Asian-American group, a term and identity used to describe Americans from all Asian backgrounds.</p>\n<p>According to Okamoto, Asian ethnic groups in America did not organize to form a shared panethnic identity until 1968.</p>\n<p>“Before 1968, the legal identity of Asian Americans was divided, with representatives from China, Japan, Korea,” Okamoto said. “They didn’t form alliances — instead they formed their own separate ethnic communities with their own systems of social assistance and support, and at times they intentionally distinguished themselves from one another.”</p>\n<p>Okamoto also said there are a variety of differences between Asian ethnic groups, preventing the formation of a unified group prior to 1968. According to Okamoto, social, religious and economic factors contributed to separations between Asian immigrant groups in America.</p>\n<p>“They spoke different languages; they brought different cultural traditions with them from their homeland; they also practiced different religions. This is something that still happens today,” Okamoto said. “I would also argue that during this period different ethnic groups didn’t work together in the fields … because they arrived in successive waves to the United States. When one group fell out of favor, another group came to meet the labor demand.”</p>\n<p>According to Okamoto, a new Asian-American identity formed in the 1960s when Asian-Americans sought involvement in the black power movement, the anti-war movement and protests at UC Berkeley and San Francisco State for ethnic studies programs.</p>\n<p>“Asian American students and community activists began to realize their unique position and perspective, and they created an identity that encompassed all Asian origin groups,” Okamoto said. “They rejected the label ‘oriental’ because it represented the European colonialist view and instead adopted the identity of Asian-American.”</p>\n<p>Okamoto said the creation of a panethnic group like Asian-American does not replace individual ethnic groups such as Chinese and Korean-Americans.</p>\n<p>“I argue that when panethnicity occurs — when ethnic backgrounds expand to other groups and an all encompassing identity — this doesn’t necessarily mean that boundaries have been displaced or attenuated,” Okamoto said. “Instead, the boundaries can have a layered quality where multiple identities can coexist and even be complimentary.”</p>\n<p>According to Okamoto, the creation of panethnic groups allows immigrant groups to build new, powerful communities.</p>\n<p>“By trying to alter widely agreed-upon racial categories through organizing, Asian-Americans have attempted to change the meaning of these racial categories,” Okamoto said. “By doing this, immigrant groups can create new forms of community and identity and can call for shifts in the current distribution of resources.”</p>\n<p>MCC program director Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said Okamoto was invited to the MCC’s “Race Matters” series to emphasize a theme of intersectionality and bring a new perspective to the MCC.</p>\n<p>“The logic of the ‘Race Matters’ series is to bring a diverse group of academic experts working in various fields that intersect with race in one form or another,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “We wanted a representative from the Asian-American community to bring diversity and variance to the MCC, and Dina Okamoto’s work is very cutting edge, and she’s an incredible sociologist.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Arpan Singh said she enjoyed hearing about Asian-American involvement in the 1960s protest movement.</p>\n<p>“I liked how she explained the different perspectives in the protest movement,” Singh said.</p>\n<p>Graduate student Annie Hikido said issues of Asian American identity are especially relevant in California.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really important, particularly in California, [which] does have an incredibly large Asian American population that is increasing both as a general race and as the ethnicities within it,” Hikido said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

the emergency contraceptive Plan B One-Step through events held at college campuses throughout the country. At UCSB’s event, students had the chance to learn information about various contraceptive options, participate in a photo booth and interact with MTV series “Girl Code” celebrities Carly Aquilino and Nessa Diab.

Like, I wanted to get involved, too, and they’re just so welcoming with open arms.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65714\" style=\"width: 459px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Her-Campus_Jenny-LUo-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"765595074\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65710\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65714\" data-attachment-id=\"65714\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/her-campus-hosts-perfectly-imperfect-to-promote-plan-b-body-positivity/her-campus_jenny-luo-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Her-Campus_Jenny-LUo-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 6D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1445477612\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"32\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Her Campus_Jenny LUo-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Her-Campus_Jenny-LUo-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Her-Campus_Jenny-LUo-3.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-65714\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Her-Campus_Jenny-LUo-3-1024x682.jpg?resize=449%2C299\" alt=\"Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus\" width=\"449\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Her-Campus_Jenny-LUo-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Her-Campus_Jenny-LUo-3.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Her-Campus_Jenny-LUo-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Her-Campus_Jenny-LUo-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65714\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>According to Tang, society criticizes imperfections that should instead be celebrated.</p>\n<p>“I think our society pressures people to think they’re imperfect, especially young women,” Tang said. “I think everyone has something special — something great about them, and that’s to be celebrated instead of putting that down.”</p>\n<p>Third-year communication major Erica Valbusa said students need to hear that that having imperfections is normal.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s cool because in college you strive to be the best, but there are some setbacks, so this kind of reassures you that not everyone is perfect and it’s ok, so embrace it and there are ways to help you get there,” Valbusa said.</p>\n<p>According to Dr. Ramos, the emergency contraceptive Plan B One-Step is not an abortion pill but an option for when other forms of contraception fail. Dr. Ramos said the active ingredient in the Plan B One-Step is levonorgestrel, a manufactured hormone in a class of medications called progestins.</p>\n<p>“87 percent of the women’s survey believe that emergency contraception will harm the existing pregnancy, and the reality is it will not — as a matter of fact, it helps prevent a pregnancy,” Dr. Ramos said. “So, it’s really important to realize that it works similar to the way birth control [works], but you’ve got one hormone at a much higher dose, so it is not an abortive agent.”</p>\n<p>Diab said it is important to make self-image decisions based off of facts and evidence, not societal pressures.</p>\n<p>“We live in a world right now where we’re being judged all the time — there’s so much pressure from day to day,” Diab said. “When you have this pressure to constantly be perfect, you might make decisions based off pressure and … that’s why it’s important to be true to yourself … to be prepared for situations like this and to accept the fact that we’re not perfect.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

seminar titled “Citizen Engagement (and Disengagement) in Response to Climate Change” to discuss the communication of climate change at Bren Hall Thursday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Levine presented research on how personalizing information about environmental issues affects people’s attitudes. Levine’s research is based on an experiment in which he gave sheets presenting the issue of climate change to different subject groups with varying degrees of urgency and observed which participants chose to sign a petition in support of political action on climate change. He found those who received more personalized, urgent information were less likely to want to engage in a solution.</p>\n<p>Levine said people become less willing to conserve resources when climate change is presented as an urgent, personalized issue.</p>\n<p>“It might have cognitive consequences which might decrease the belief that because the really important goal is difficult to achieve, perhaps what I need to do is conserve my resources to focus on those goals,” Levine said. “What we are finding is that seemingly helpful rhetoric can backfire in [a] really important and consequential way, and that it is important to highlight that,” Levine said.</p>\n<p>Bren Environmental Science and Management (EMS) graduate student Michelle Graff said Levine’s research contradicted her preexisting ideas.</p>\n<p>“It is a belief that you should make things more personal because somebody can find those connections,” Graff said. “So I did think it was really interesting that sometimes that actually does the exact opposite.”</p>\n<p>According to Graff, using fear tactics to motivate people to act on environmental issues is ineffective.</p>\n<p>“There has generally been a shift in climate change communication to it being a doomsday kind of thing,” Graff said. “It will be difficult, but there are ways to approach it in a manageable way — more of focusing on people’s ability of what they can get done.”</p>\n<p>Bren EMS graduate student Tova Handelman said Levine’s research reveals why people are often pessimistic about environmental issues.</p>\n<p>“Maybe one of the reasons that the messaging against climate change has been so effective [is] because it kind of gives people the option to not do anything about it” Handelman said.</p>\n<p>Sierra Club member Robert Bernstein said Levine’s research is “priceless.”</p>\n<p>“Somebody has actually done evidential research on what it is that motivates people to do environmental action,” Bernstein said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65722\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/adam-seth-levine-hosts-seminar-discussing-presentation-of-climate-change/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65722\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/adam-seth-levine-hosts-seminar-discussing-presentation-of-climate-change/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/adam-seth-levine-hosts-seminar-discussing-presentation-of-climate-change/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/adam-seth-levine-hosts-seminar-discussing-presentation-of-climate-change/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/adam-seth-levine-hosts-seminar-discussing-presentation-of-climate-change/","id":2645,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[2644,2643,2642],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
