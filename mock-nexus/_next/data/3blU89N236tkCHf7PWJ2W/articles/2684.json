According to SCNCC, climate change is especially a threat to the poor, women, people of color and those who live in the Global South. After an initial introduction on Friday night, the conference held various workshops, plenary sessions and activities to encourage sharing ideas that challenge the current system. Over 20 workshops were held throughout the weekend, each offering a slightly different perspective on the various issues of poverty, environment and human rights.<br>\nOrganizer and UCSB professor of sociology John Foran said a graduate student in his sociology class, Earth in Crisis, inspired him to join SCNCC. According to Foran, climate change is a result of capitalism and requires a better, more extensive solution.</p>\n<p>“I learned about [SCNCC] and I thought this was more or less what I think about the climate crisis — that it needs a deep systemic solution, a radical solution,” Foran said. “The climate crisis cannot be solved within the logic of capitalism or globalization as we know it — it’s too big and caused by the normal operation of those systems.”</p>\n<p>Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein addressed the audience through Skype, and said there needs to be a “comprehensive solution for a comprehensive problem” that solves issues of climate change as well as social inequality.</p>\n<p>“We need solutions that address jobs that address climate, that address racial justice,” Stein said. “Ecology is pitted against our economy and our jobs and this is a false divide, so it’s very important we put out solutions that meet it and that we take on the economic crisis at the same time as the environment.”<br>\nAccording to Stein, there should be increased financial aid for students who struggle to pay for higher education.</p>\n<p>“About two-thirds of all college students, both current and former, are in disabling debt because their jobs do not provide enough to pay back that debt,” Stein said. “We are not only calling for free public higher education but also to abolish student debt. It is critical to bail out of students to liberate our younger generation to be the leaders that they must be.”</p>\n<p>Seattle City Council member Kshama Sawant delivered a short speech through a YouTube video and said the current capitalistic economy and political systems prioritize profits and neglect people and the environment.</p>\n<p>“This is the reality of international capitalism,” Sawant said. “This is the product of the gigantic casino of speculation created by those highway robbers on Wall Street and the rapacious oil vultures. In this system, the market is God and everything is sacrificed on the altar of profit.”</p>\n<p>Foran said the title of the conference combines the need for social equality and to preserve the environment to form the term “ecosocialism.”</p>\n<p>“Socialism, translated into what it means in my heart, means trying to create a more equal society,” Foran said. “It means fighting against the gross inequality that exists in the world today. Ecosocialism brings in the climate crisis part … By 21st-century ecosocialism, we mean a new kind of ecosocialism that is explicitly and deeply democratic. It’s a way of saying we don’t think there’s enough democracy in the world today.”</p>\n<p>According to Foran, the conference cultivates interest in those who are just discovering the movement and connects them with long-time activists.</p>\n<p>“This conference brings together our undergrads, who are starting to have a little interest in the climate crisis, with people who are up and down the coast of all generations, who are seasoned ecosocialists,” Foran said. “Out of these chance encounters grow relationships and new knowledge and new passion.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Ortega served two tours in Iraq, one tour in Afghanistan and is currently a helicopter crew chief stationed in Oahu, Hawaii. Ortega stepped into the national spotlight over the last year, advocating for transgender rights in the military.</p>\n<p>Ortega said the takeaway from the event should be to engage in more honest and difficult discussions about rights for marginalized groups.</p>\n<p>“Have tough conversations with people,” Ortega said. “That’s the most powerful thing you can do. They don’t have to be conversations where you attack or are in opposition, but you have to have tough, honest conversations with people.”</p>\n<p>Ortega said people have the responsibility to be involved in decision-making as conscientious voters.</p>\n<p>“We have to start the change with us,” Ortega said. “If you want there to be change … you need to get out there and vote.”</p>\n<p>According to Ortega, the Pentagon currently has a 12-person council led by Under Secretary of the Army Brad R. Carson to discuss transgender rights in the military. Ortega said the council’s decisions often correlate with the public’s opinion.</p>\n<p>“The decision about trans inclusion in the military is currently with a think tank led by Mr. Carson, the Under Secretary of the Department of the Army and 12 guys at the Pentagon with whom I correspond,” Ortega said.</p>\n<p>RCSGD director David Whitman said Ortega addressed important issues on which many students lack knowledge, such as the varying identities on a “gender spectrum.”</p>\n<p>“As a trans man and a trans masculine-presenting person, Ortega gave a lot of awareness to different identities within the gender spectrum,” Whitman said. “He talked about his journey as a trans person and what aspects of his life led to his ability to be himself and I think that was empowering.”</p>\n<p>Whitman said Ortega’s talk is also applicable to university students, though the talk focused on his experience in the military.</p>\n<p>“I would love to see UCSB students come together and prioritize diversity initiatives,” Whitman said. “There are endless communities and intersections in those communities that are very much at risk but are also very much deserving of our respect, love, attention … the more we lean into things we don’t know about … I think the healthier our communities will be.”</p>\n<p>Diversity Education Coordinator for RCSGD and third-year sociology major Khadeja Tran said the campus should increase the number of resources for transgender students.</p>\n<p>“There are also trans people on campus, a lot of them, who maybe aren’t out yet, who maybe are in between, who need the resources or help from faculty, staff and students to feel more included and for the campus environment to be more inclusive,” Tran said.</p>\n<p>Second-year music composition major Tino Jones said Ortega carried the conversation about transgender rights in the military into public focus.</p>\n<p>“Transgender appearance in the military is something that has been widely debated — whether or not [they] should be there,” Jones said. “Shane Ortega’s success is showing that you can do things even though someone may tell you that you can’t.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the Thursday, October 8, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Capps Center for the Study of Ethics, Religion and Public Life, highlighted recent social justice issues such as the Black Lives Matter movement, student activism and two of Dees’ most notable lawsuits against the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). Dees earned a law degree from the University of Alabama in 1960, after which he founded the Southern Poverty Law Center in 1971, a nonprofit legal advocacy specializing in civil rights and combating hate and intolerance. In 2006, the National Law Journal included Dees in its list of the top 100 most influential lawyers in America.</p>\n<p>Dees said some people feel threatened by the increase of diversity in American in recent years.</p>\n<p>“It seems like America’s changed a lot in 15 years. This changing demographics and what it portends for the next 20, 30 years, it’s creating an enormous fear — a fear for those people who felt that they were privileged,” Dees said.</p>\n<p>According to Dees, “xenophobia” becomes more prevalent as cultures mix. Providing an example of this, Dees said he once represented Vietnamese fishermen after white fishermen mistreated them in Houston, Texas in 1981.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t long before they were out-fishing the American fishermen,” Dees said. “There’s no other way to put it but the American fishermen got jealous.”</p>\n<p>Dees said the white fishermen enlisted the help of the KKK, but he won the case on behalf of the Vietnamese one day before the shrimping season began, at which time the United States Marshals began protecting the Vietnamese fishermen.</p>\n<p>Dees said a television network that “starts with the letter F” spreads distorted information in order to create a reactionary response that spreads hate and intolerance.</p>\n<p>“We have mainstream hate in America and it’s because of these changing demographics,” Dees said. “America is great because of its diversity, not in spite of it.”</p>\n<p>Dees said he is disappointed by how popular Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has become and disapproves of his plan to deport millions of immigrants.</p>\n<p>“It’s saddening that the American public would buy into this,” Dees said. “Facts don’t seem to matter when you have a demigod leading the pack.”</p>\n<p>According to Dees, “98 percent of police officers” in the United States are good people, but Americans, especially racial minorities, are being victimized by the remaining two percent.</p>\n<p>“Innocent African-Americans and others are being shot by trigger-happy police officers,” Dees said.</p>\n<p>Walter H. Capps Center Public Service Intern and fourth-year global studies major Lindsay Apperson said Dees’ activism is inspiring, especially given his continued work at the age of 78.</p>\n<p>“He has done so much incredible social work and empowered a lot of marginalized populations,” Apperson said. “He’s … still fighting court cases against injustices. It’s pretty incredible.”</p>\n<p>Apperson said she was surprised when she saw the majority of the audience was not students, but rather older attendees.</p>\n<p>“It was a lot of more elderly members of the greater Santa Barbara community than students, which I thought was a little disappointing,” Apperson said.</p>\n<p>Dees said students have a chance to participate in the ongoing movement for tolerance and civil rights.</p>\n<p>“To the students here tonight: you have a front-row seat on that march for justice,” Dees said. “You can either sit on that seat or become involved.”</p><div

Planned Parenthood Generation Action lobbied in favor of Assembly Bill 329 (AB 329), authored by Assemblymember Shirley Weber, which passed into law on Oct. 1 and aims to strengthen sex education and HIV/AIDS prevention. On Sept. 29, members tabled for Pink Out Day of Action, a nation-wide movement to spread information about the services Planned Parenthood provides such as cancer screenings, sexually transmitted disease testing and birth control.</p>\n<p>Director of public affairs at Planned Parenthood of Santa Barbara, Ventura and San Luis Obispo Gina Fischer said the UCSB chapter brought six students to Sacramento to lobby in support of AB 329 in June 2015.</p>\n<p>“We had our students taking a lead talking to our legislators about the importance of this bill,” Fischer said. “We teach them how to organize their communities and how to talk to elected officials and how to develop their own leadership skills in the reproductive justice movement.”</p>\n<p>Co-president of Planned Parenthood Generation Action at UCSB and second-year feminist studies major Jill Pember said she attended the Planned Parenthood Generation Action Conference in Washington D.C. and spoke to politicians.</p>\n<p>“I got the chance to lobby to representatives of our California senators and to California congresswomen and that was really inspiring,” Pember said. “It was amazing to share my story with politicians and really feel like I was making a difference.”</p>\n<p>Second-year pre-biology major Anastacia Menemenlis said she is “grateful” for the services Planned Parenthood Generation Action at UCSB provides.</p>\n<p>“I appreciate their effort and any effort to increase student awareness about birth control and sexual health issues,” Menemenlis said.</p>\n<p>Students for Life UCSB president and fourth-year economics major Katie Devlin said Students for Life tables on campus and encourages students to consider alternatives to abortion, providing them with resources to make their decision.</p>\n<p>“We table on campus to raise awareness about abortion and let students know that there are alternatives to abortion,” Devlin said. “We have a list of resources to give to pregnant students to help them, and we work to provide a safe and supportive community.”</p>\n<p>Second-year anthropology and psychology double-major Lauren Van Oeveren said it is positive for both organizations to educate the community.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s cool that people are sharing their knowledge or beliefs so that people can form an opinion,” Van Oeveren said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 8 of the Thursday, October 8, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65125\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/students-represent-both-sides-on-pink-out-day/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65125\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/students-represent-both-sides-on-pink-out-day/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/students-represent-both-sides-on-pink-out-day/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/students-represent-both-sides-on-pink-out-day/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/students-represent-both-sides-on-pink-out-day/","id":2683,"author":{"id":155,"name":"Zareena Zaidi"},"related":[2682,2681,2680],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
