In high school, it’s either the final run or a chance to continue playing in college. In college, it’s either the final run or a chance to do something less than one percent of all Americans do: play sports professionally.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For senior co-captain of the UC Santa Barbara men’s tennis team, Nicolas Moreno de Alboran, his final season marks both. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreno de Alboran came into this new season ranked No. 6 out of 125 athletes in the country according to the ITA Tennis National Ranking. His ranking is by far the highest any player has achieved in program history. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For perspective, last season, Moreno de Alboran came into the year ranked No. 42. At the time, that was the highest ranking achieved by any Gaucho in history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like most athletes, Moreno de Alboran has been playing tennis since he was a young boy. However, unlike most athletes, the New York native did not even start playing competitively until much later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really just started playing tennis just hitting a few balls around while I was in the Dominican Republic,” Moreno de Alboran said. “I never even took it seriously at the beginning, it was more of a hobby and a way to exercise.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Moreno de Alboran moved to England, he gained new insight into how much he loved tennis. He realized it would take a lot of work, but he wanted to compete at a high level. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, by the time he started competing, most players who hope to pursue tennis at least in college have played at least in 100 tournaments, whereas Moreno de Alboran did not. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was hard to get good, but as I got better I knew I wanted it so I had to compete in tournaments. But by the end, I only competed in about 20 tournaments as a junior which is nothing compared to most,” Moreno de Alboran said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, those tournaments were enough to garner some serious attention from some Division-I programs including UCSB and Head Coach Marty Davis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You know it’s funny when we began recruiting him we actually did not know how little tennis he had played compared to most,” Davis said. “But we knew we wanted him and glad we got him.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I got here Marty and Blake [Mueller, Associate Head Coach] gave me the opportunity to play and get better. I don’t think that would have happened anywhere else,” Moreno de Alboran said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the playing Moreno de Alboran did his freshman year certainly paid off. In his rookie campaign, the New York native posted an 18-8 overall mark and went 15-7 in dual match play. This was enough to earn him Big West Freshman of the Year honors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was and still am so grateful Marty and Blake gave me the opportunity to come to play here and show what I am capable of. Being in a team like this, in a school like this, has helped me to develop my game so much,” Moreno de Alboran said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Little did Moreno de Alboran know he would improve significantly from his freshman year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, Moreno de Alboran went 29-11 overall. He also became the first Gaucho to be invited to the ITA National Fall Singles tournament, was named the 2018 Big West Player of the Year, led his team to a fourth-straight Big West crown, earned the highest national ranking in singles in program history at that point and became the first UCSB athlete to win an NCAA Singles Championships match since 1995.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This season, Moreno de Alboran already looks like he is ready to accomplish more. In just the fall tournament portion of the schedule, the three-time first team all-conference standout went 13-5 earning key wins against players currently ranked No. 5, No. 8, No. 33, No. 54 and more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreno de Alboran’s current No. 6 ranking is not only the highest in program history but also the highest of any Big West athlete in the last 22 years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who would have thought that a kid who played tennis for fun growing up and didn’t even play competitively until late in life would be this good?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You always hope players turn out as good as Nic but you never know, how could you? We knew he had a world class forehand and he has built his game around that, but he has grown so much in all facets of his game that his game as a freshman compared to now is a night and day difference,” Davis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even Moreno de Alboran could not have expected to be in this position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No, I never thought I would be this good because I never saw tennis as 10 years ahead, five years ahead. I always stayed focused day by day. I never thought I would be playing against the best players in the nation and beating them,” Moreno de Alboran said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85809\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mde.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1858585371\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"85807\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85809\" data-attachment-id=\"85809\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/moreno-de-alboran-set-for-storybook-senior-season/mde/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mde.jpg?fit=1799%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1799,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Mde\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mde.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mde.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-85809\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mde-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mde.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mde.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mde.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mde.jpg?w=1799&amp;ssl=1 1799w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-85809\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Moreno de Alboran (right) celebrating with fellow senior co-captain and doubles partner Anders Holm (left). <em>Photo courtesy of UCSB Athletics</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, the work is not done. Two years ago, and even last year, making it to the semifinals or quarterfinals against the top players in the country was a win. For a small mid-major like UCSB and Moreno de Alboran usually just making it to a big game is seen as a win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this year, Santa Barbara and their senior co-captain are ready to go beyond just making the big game, they want to win it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last season, Moreno de Alboran came within a set of defeating the No. 1 player in the country, Martin Redlicki of UCLA at the NCAA Singles Championships after winning his first-round match the day before. That was good enough for last year, not this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Nic is </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">no longer in the stage of just being happy to be here. He knows he deserves to be here and he knows he could hang with these guys, they aren’t that far in skill level anymore. Now he just has to go out there and beat them,”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Davis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t see why I couldn’t beat anyone in this country right now. Those rankings are just numbers I don’t see them as better or worse, I see every match as an opportunity to grow and represent the Gauchos,” Moreno de Alboran said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the team as a whole, the Gauchos are poised for major success. In doubles, Moreno de Alboran and fellow senior teammate Anders Holm are one of the best pairs in the country. In singles, this team is talented from top to bottom including having junior Joseph Guillin play at the No. 2 court. Guillin is currently ranked No. 22 in the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last season, UCSB nearly upset one of the best tennis programs in the country, USC, at its own home in the first round of the NCAA Team Championships. The score ended 4-1 in favor of the Trojans, but if you were at the game, you would know the Gauchos were leading on all singles courts at one point and looked like they would win on most.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was good enough for last season, not this one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Last year showed us our program was headed in the right direction. We have a goal this year, to win another Big West and to get our first NCAA win since 1998, and with Nic and some of our other guys I think we could do it,” Davis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost like it was meant to be, Moreno de Alboran and UCSB as a whole are peaking together at what feels like the right time. Just this past Saturday the Gauchos won their season opener 5-2 against San Diego State and Moreno de Alboran looked impressive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It will be interesting to see what awaits the program and the athlete that helped it turn into quite possibly the best mid-major in the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I get goosebumps when I get reminded of that,” Moreno de Alboran said. “I am super grateful for my coaches, my teammates, this school and I am super excited for this season. It is my last one and I am ready to soak everything in.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 and p.4 of the Jan. 24th, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

During that span, Santa Barbara picked up road victories over No.49 Washington and No.50 Loyola Marymount.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Gauchos were dominant in Big West play, easily winning their fourth straight conference title and accomplishing the goal that Davis set for them at the beginning of the season. The team also set a Big West record by winning their conference games of a combined score of 43-0.</p>\n<p>“The perfect score line in conference play is unbelievable, and a record that will never be topped,” Davis said.</p>\n<p>This team also once again established something that avid college tennis fans have long known: they have one of the best fan bases on the entire west coast. Propelled behind a raucous crowd at every home match, the Gauchos finished the season 11-0 at home — their second time going undefeated at home in the last three years.</p>\n<p>“The undefeated streak at home is a testament to our wonderful fans, many of whom made it up to SLO for our match with Cal Poly and to USC last Saturday,” Davis said. “The energy and atmosphere they provide is critical to the success we’ve enjoyed.”</p>\n<p>Individually, UCSB also experienced breakout seasons from many of their unproven players. Perhaps the most impressive example is sophomore Joseph Guillin. After transferring from Florida, Guillin started the season at the No.4 spot on the court, slowly climbing his way up as far as the No.1 spot. Overall, he finished the season with a 19-2 record, including seven wins out of his last eight matches.</p>\n<p>Krustev also left his mark in his first year: Despite not joining the team until January, Krustev finished 14-6 in singles play, and he and Guillin combined for an 11-4 record in doubles play on court three.</p>\n<p>On the top courts, the Gauchos once again received steady contributions from junior Nicolas Moreno de Alboran and senior captain Simon Freund.</p>\n<p>On court one, Moreno De Alboran went 15-5 on the season, winning his last eight matches on the season. His dominance during conference play also earned him the Big West Player of the Year Award, as well as a spot at the singles NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>Freund finished his career in fashion, winning his last ten matches in a row and finishing with an overall singles record of 17-5.</p>\n<p>In addition, Freund was nominated for the Arthur Ashe Leadership and Sportsmanship Award, while Moreno de Alboran was nominated for the ITA Player to Watch Award.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to the future, the Gauchos will return all of their starters except for Freund, priming them to be even more dominant next season.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, however, the team will enjoy all they have accomplished this season.</p>\n<p>“I’m extremely proud of the way this team represented our university, our alumni and our former team members … both on and off the court,” Davis said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 17th</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Nonetheless, the Gauchos appear to be on the rise, as they are now competitively sitting much more comfortably amongst their Big West competitors in the five spot.</p>\n<p>In what began as a pitchers’ duel in the first inning, the team’s offense successfully broke away from Hawaii early on and showed a much more aggressive side than we have seen lately. Fueled by Hawaii’s defensive shortcomings including a throwing error and a walk in the second inning, the lineup produced two runs with just two hits.</p>\n<p>Hawaii’s Callee Heen, however, responded fiercely to her team’s complacency. The junior catcher hit a monstrous home run, her 13th of the 2018 season, driving in two runs to tie the game in the fourth. Compiled on top of a competitive .296 batting average, the power-hitter boasts a 0.543 slugging percentage.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the Gauchos immediately countered their opponent’s advancements.</p>\n<p>Freshman Sammy Fabian began what became a four-hit rally, singling through the left side. The left fielder has consistently dominated offensively throughout the season and is batting .362, the team’s highest overall batting average.</p>\n<p>Alyssa Diaz, Genesis Ramirez, and Rayna Cohen followed suit, in total racking up three runs for Santa Barbara, making the score 5-2.</p>\n<p>Diaz, the sophomore first-baseman, has been a standout offensive tool for the Gauchos so far in conference play. Her .464 batting average towers high above the rest as she has had 13 hits in only 28 at-bats.</p>\n<p>After going on a four-game dry streak, center fielder Rayna Cohen went 2 for 3 in the game and 3 for 5 in the series. Cohen now has five RBIs in Big West play and can hopefully use this momentum to continue to boost her both her batting average and confidence at the plate.</p>\n<p>Challenged once again by Hawaii’s relentless offense, the Gauchos found themselves with a tie-game come the bottom of the seventh and multiple extra innings loomed ahead if the stagnancy continued. Freshman Maci Fines, who flaunts a .393 batting average in the conference, came in clutch with a walk-off single to right center.</p>\n<p>Though its offense’s execution at the plate played a vital role in the successful outcome of the series, UCSB’s solid defense cannot go unnoticed.</p>\n<p>Let this series be a preview for those to come as the Gauchos’ lack of consistency on the mound has been, for now, halted.</p>\n<p>Felisha Noriega appeared in both games. The sophomore pitched a shutout, allowing just two hits, to begin the day as she watched her team mercilessly pile on eight runs against their opponent. Noriega has pitched the most innings of the five-person lineup and has maintained a 4.59 ERA.</p>\n<p>Senior Lena Mayer came in as Noriega’s reliever in the second game, shutting down the Hawaii offense in two last crucial innings.</p>\n<p>That being said, the Gauchos’ offense will also not be taken for granted in their high scoring blowout. Amidst a total of 11 hits, there were two doubles and a home-run. Over the span of the doubleheader, Santa Barbara impressively totaled 21 hits.</p>\n<p>From here, it seems the Gauchos may have finally found their groove.

The Gauchos’ 3-0 conference record contributes to their even more promising 12-6 overall standing. Cal Poly’s almost identical record threatens UC Santa Barbara’s spot in the number one seed of the Big West. Both statistically and chronologically, however, Hawai’i seems to be the secondary competitor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Rainbow Warriors sit two conference games behind SB, their season marked only by a singular loss in their Big West debut. Overall, the team sports a less than .500 winning percentage, tallying seven wins out of a total 17 games. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding both doubles and singles records, the Gaucho roster statistically dominates that of the Rainbow Warriors. The Gauchos have seen ongoing success from their three most dominant pairings, which together have accumulated over half of the total wins this season.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of these, junior-sophomore duo Joseph Guillin and Victor Krustev arguably contribute most consistently to this domination. The year-old pairing is the only one to see time in all three Big West matches, and if it weren’t for an intermittent loss in the non-conference match against No. 46 Cal Berkeley, the two would be handily sporting an 11-match win streak. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nicolas Moreno de Alboran and Anders Holm pose a similar threat to the Rainbow Warriors. Both incredibly strong players on their own, the senior pairing exemplifies a vital combination of precision and experience. Earlier in the season, the co-captains defeated the No. 17 pairing in the country, Jacob Brumm and Yuta Kikuchi of Cal. Wins in the upcoming two games could push their win streak to six. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As singles players, the two seniors remain among the top three most consistent players the Gauchos have to offer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A defending First Team All-Conference player — for singles and doubles — 2018 Big West Player of the Year and No. 6-ranked ITA Division I athlete, Moreno de Alboran brings measurable skill to the Gauchos’ roster. He currently leads his team in match victories, totaling 24 on the season, and even holds above a 0.500 winning percentage versus national players. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Holm will go into the weekend with six straight singles victories — five of which were two-game sweeps.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is hardly a comparable duo or single on the opposing roster to those seen on Santa Barbara’s. In the last three matchups versus the Rainbow Warriors, the home team’s seemingly impenetrable lineup has swept its competitor 7-0. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since last facing each other, however, Hawai’i has added a crucial player to its squad: freshman Andre Ilagan. In dual matches, the rookie tops his teammates by securing 11 wins and only five losses — the only player with an above .500 winning percentage. Earlier in the season, Ilagan was named Big West Conference Athlete of the Week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a much more seasoned Santa Barbara team, it should be interesting to see the route that Gaucho Head Coach Marty Davis takes when selecting a competitor for Ilagan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB must also look out for sophomore Blaz Seric, who as of two weeks ago was named BWC Player of the Week following outstanding performances against UC Davis, UC Irvine and UC Riverside. Seric finds himself on a hot streak that could be tough to break; for seven games now, the 6’7” standout has crushed his competition in both doubles and singles play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, the finale of the Gauchos’ Big West Conference play will depend both on their performance against Cal Poly and Hawai’i. Though traditionally Hawai’i has not been as intimidating a competitor as Cal Poly, the ‘Bows, as always, bring to the court players eager to win and boost their own conference status. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB men’s tennis team will face Hawai’i at home on Sunday, April 21, at 1 p.m., with the hopes of solidifying a No. 1 conference placement. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87616\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-19/ucsb-looks-to-remain-unbeaten-in-conference-play-takes-on-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87616\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-19/ucsb-looks-to-remain-unbeaten-in-conference-play-takes-on-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-19/ucsb-looks-to-remain-unbeaten-in-conference-play-takes-on-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-19/ucsb-looks-to-remain-unbeaten-in-conference-play-takes-on-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-19/ucsb-looks-to-remain-unbeaten-in-conference-play-takes-on-hawaii/","id":1256,"author":{"id":283,"name":"Annika Pearson"},"related":[1255,1254,1253],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
