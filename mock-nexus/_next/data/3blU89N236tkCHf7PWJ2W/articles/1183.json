Complementing these school records were 25 home runs and 256 RBIs in the team’s 56 game schedule. The longest winning streak the Gauchos managed to attain throughout the season was over the span of four games during their non-conference schedule which began at the Stacy Winsberg Invitational. In addition, on four separate occasions the Gauchos achieved a three-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the season, the Gauchos had both impressive collective performances as a team and from individual players. The young, raw talent this team possessed managed to contribute to multiple victories this season and formed a foundation that will continue to benefit the team for years to come.</p>\n<p>Various players on the team emerged with admirable performances throughout the year. Senior infielder Arianna Palomares had a great end to her softball career ranking second in totals of 30 runs scored, 37 RBIs, 55 hits and 10 doubles which tied sophomore Jessica Johnston as a team-high.</p>\n<p>While batting third in the Gaucho lineup, she delivered clutch hits all year long and showed durability by playing in all 56 games and leading the team in at-bats with 180.  By the end of the season, Palomares had a .363 on base percentage, a .411 slugging percentage and a .306 batting average.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for UCSB, junior outfielder Kristen Clark will return for one more season, as she has been a valuable asset and leadoff hitter on this team since her freshman year. Clark made big improvements this season, earning multiple team highs and personal records of her own. Clark excelled with an outstanding .402 batting average for third best in the Big West, finished with an incredible .457 on base percentage and a .447 slugging percentage. Hitting atop the Gaucho lineup, Clark also led the team with 41 runs, 72 hits and 17 stolen bases.</p>\n<p>Freshman infielder Sierra Altmeyer played at a veteran level in her first season as a Gaucho, tallying a team high 42 RBIs to rank third in conference play, and performed best when under pressure. Altmeyer had a team high 12 doubles and seven home runs while scoring 20 runs, and led the team with 20 extra base hits. Often batting cleanup, she finished the season with a whopping .500 slugging percentage, a .297 batting average and drew 22 walks to lead the team alongside Johnston.</p>\n<p>Aside from tying for the team lead in walk, sophomore outfielder Jessica Johnston had an overall stellar year, and should be a force in the heart of the Gaucho lineup for years to come. She finished with a solid .322 batting average and a commanding .418 on-base percentage, both good for second on the team.</p>\n<p>The second year player also led the team with three triples, was second with six stolen bases and had 14 extra base hits. As stepping into the batter’s box is a risk each time, Altmeyer constantly displayed her grit and determination when facing pitchers despite being hit by a pitch seven times this season.</p>\n<p>Another key component to the Gauchos’ lineup was junior infielder Emily Brucelas, playing in all 56 games and ranking second on the team with five homeruns. She registered 50 hits, 13 extra base hits and 26 RBIs this year while scoring 27 runs.</p>\n<p>Also contributing was freshman infielder Melanie Menor with 47 hits on the year, none bigger than the clutch two-out home run she delivered against Fullerton to give the Gauchos the lead and the win on the last day of the season.</p>\n<p>Senior starting pitcher Ashley Ludlow had an outstanding year to close out her collegiate career, oftentimes putting the team on her back when they needed it most. Ludlow managed a stellar ERA of 2.87. She collected 10 wins on the season, pitching 41 games and tallied an impressive 157 strikeouts in 178.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Freshman pitcher Veronika Gulvin also found her place on the team earning eight wins this season while pitching 113.1 innings in 35 games with a 3.52 ERA.  She showed up on the mound in crucial times, striking out 62 hitters. Gulvin was reliable in the pitching rotation, and also provided a dependable go-to arm when senior starter Ashley Ludlow needed relief.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have many things to be proud of this season. For the first time in four years, UCSB swept rival Cal Poly and went 3-0 against UC Davis. As a team, the Gauchos scored 246 runs, had a .370 on base percentage and a .397 slugging percentage.</p>\n<p>With most of its roster returning, there is no doubt that this team has a bright future ahead.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Clark’s storied career at UCSB has been stunning to watch; after collecting Big West Freshman of the Year and First Team All-Big West honors in her first year, Clark achieved Second Team All-Big West her sophomore year, and she followed that up with another First Team appearance her junior year.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Clark’s career slash line of .399/.446/.432 boggles the mind, and after hitting over .400 for the second time in three years, she became the first Gaucho to ever accomplish that feat in two separate seasons.</p>\n<p>Sophomore infielder Sierra Altmeyer also provides the Gauchos with some established returning talent. Altmeyer rocked seven home runs and 42 RBI, both top five marks in the conference, and she was selected to both the Big West All-Freshman Team and the Second Team All-Big West.</p>\n<p>With star pitcher Ashley Ludlow’s college career over, the Gauchos will look to sophomore Veronica Gulvin to fill her shoes. Gulvin tossed 113 innings in 2016, good for second-most on the team to Ludlow, and, despite her 8-12 record, a 3.52 ERA shows the youngster has some promise.</p>\n<p>This weekend’s duels with Boston College and Wright State will pit UCSB against two brand-new opponents in their history.</p>\n<p>BC is coming off a 30-23 season, and the team retained all its offensive starters except for two. Junior pitcher Jessica Dreswick is coming off a great season (14-8, 2.47 ERA), and she combines with fellow junior Allyson Frei (186 strikeouts in 2016) to form a dominant one-two punch for the Eagle pitching rotation. The Gauchos will likely have to face one, if not both pitchers this weekend, so the offense will have to be geared up and focused on winning the small battles they can.</p>\n<p>On offense, the Eagles rely on senior catcher and third baseman Tatiana Cortez. She crushed 13 home runs on a .380 batting average in 2016, easily earning her All-ACC First-Team honors. If the Gauchos can make sure she doesn’t get into a groove this weekend, they’ll have a much easier job of containing Boston College in their two matchups.</p>\n<p>Houston was also somewhat mediocre in 2016, assembling a 27-29 overall record. With only three returning seniors, the Cougars hope a dose of fresh blood will give the team new life in 2017.</p>\n<p>Three Cougars received All-American Athletic Conference selections in 2016: sophomore pitcher Savannah Heebner on the first team and sophomore outfielders Elise LeBeouf and Maya Thomas on the second. All three were also recognized on the All-Rookie team for the conference, giving Houston a remarkable young core in 2017 and beyond.</p>\n<p>For Wright State, the combination of junior outfielder Honnah Susor, senior catcher Vivi Marquez and redshirt senior shortstop Becka Peterson will make up the brunt of the offensive attack for the Raiders. Wright State was second in the Horizon League for its second season in a row last year, and the team is eager to get over the hump in 2017.</p>\n<p>Wichita State is led by a strong senior presence, the team boasts seven in total, and comes off a 2016 season in which it won both regular season and tournament championships. Senior catcher and first baseman Macklin Hitz and junior utility player Mackenzie Wright are on the preseason All-Missouri Valley Conference team, showing the potential for this Shockers squad.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s first opponent will be Boston College at 12 p.m. on Friday, followed by Houston at 5 p.m. Saturday will pit the Gauchos against Wright State at 9:30 a.m. and Wichita State at noon. Finally, the Gauchos will rematch BC on Sunday at 8 a.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, February 9, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75578\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-softball-with-heavy-opening-slate-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75578\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-softball-with-heavy-opening-slate-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-softball-with-heavy-opening-slate-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-softball-with-heavy-opening-slate-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-softball-with-heavy-opening-slate-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/","id":1180,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[1179,1178,1177],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Back On Road Following Subpar Season Opening Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Following its underwhelming start to the season, the UCSB softball team will be back in action this weekend in hopes of reaching the .500 or above mark as it will face Nebraska-Omaha, Pacific, and Fre...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Looking to improve after a disappointing season opening weekend, the UCSB softball team will face Nebraska-Omaha, Pacific and Stanford in Palo Alto at the Stanford Nike Invitational.</p>\n<p>Action begins on Friday afternoon at 2:30 p.m. when the Gauchos play Nebraska-Omaha.

She leads the team in each of those categories except for runs batted in, where redshirt freshman infielder Vicky Kinney edges her with five.</p>\n<p>Kinney has 10 total bases of her own, accompanied by two home runs and a .714 slugging percentage. Along with senior infielder Nicole Warren (.385/.529/.692), Kinney and Klosterman are catalysts for most of Omaha’s scoring.</p>\n<p>Holding down the mound, the duo of sophomore Laura Roecker and senior Abbie Clanton are the two main pitchers for the Mavs, though each hold earned run averages over five.<br>\nRoecker has thrown in every one of Omaha’s games this season, and opponents have batted .368 against her to this point.</p>\n<p>Clanton is better in that respect, allowing a .260 batting average, but she has yet to notch a win so far this season — something Roecker accomplished on the team’s opening day.</p>\n<p>The Mavericks’ shaky pitching allows the Gauchos a valuable opportunity, one they’ll have to maximize in both games against Omaha Friday as well as at their matchup the following afternoon.</p>\n<p>Capping off UCSB’s doubleheader on Friday will be its matchup against Pacific, whom the Gauchos will play again Saturday. After losing its two opening games, Pacific owns a three-game win streak in which it has allowed only one run.</p>\n<p>The lineup is centered on a pair of senior utility players: Haylee Moran-Rowen and Cassidy Gustafson. Moran-Rowen leads the team with a .467 average, although her inability to draw a walk this season suggests her offensive production will trend downwards from here forward.</p>\n<p>Gustafson leads the team with two home runs and three runs scored; she has also contributed four RBI. She has struck out three times — tied for the squad’s most — and similarly to Moran-Rowen, she has troublingly not been walked in the season’s first five games.</p>\n<p>Most notably, Pacific has a deeper pitching rotation than Omaha and UCSB with sophomore Kenya Lindstrom and freshman Hailey Reed, who have pitched three innings each to provide solid options behind the team’s main arms, junior Marissa Young and Cassidy Gustafson. Young and Gustafson have each thrown double-digit innings in 2017 and will be the main scouting targets for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Lindstrom has been responsible for both of the team’s losses, and her 16.80 ERA is even more eye-popping when compared to the other three pitchers, all of whom have earned run averages below one.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will try to force Pacific to utilize her this weekend, hoping to make hay as other teams have been able to twice this season.</p>\n<p>Stanford, who opened up its season with six games in Arizona, was racing to a 4-0 record before losing its last two games against San Diego and Fresno State, the latter a 24-8 beat down.</p>\n<p>The Cardinal is led on offense by the scorching play of freshman catcher Teaghan Cowles, who possesses a .520 hitting clip, .556 OBP and .600 slugging percentage.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, senior infielder Kylie Sorenson owns current .400 batting, .448 OBP and .560 slugging averages. The trend of hitting continues with redshirt sophomore utility player Whitney Burks, whose stats are .360 batting, .448 OBP and .680 slugging percentages.</p>\n<p>All have at least 12 total bases and seven runs batted in (Burks leads the bunch with 11 RBI), and Cowles is the only one without a home run, though she does have a slightly rarer triple.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Carolyn Lee is Stanford’s best pitcher, holding a 1.00 ERA and 3-1 record, with two complete games, 10 strikeouts and an opponent batting average of only .228.</p>\n<p>She and freshman Nikki Bauer have combined for over 39 of the team’s 47 innings pitched, and Santa Barbara will likely see at least one of the two on Sunday.</p>\n<p>If the bats come out in full effect at Stanford and the pitchers are able to avoid the early deficits that plagued this team last week, the Gauchos should be able to rebound from their early woes.</p>\n<p>If returning to California brings no reward, however, UCSB will have dug itself into quite a hole to start the year.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces Nebraska-Omaha Friday, Feb. 17, at 2:30 p.m. It will play Pacific later that day at 4:45 p.m. Another contest against Pacific will take place Saturday, Feb. 18, at 10 a.m., while it will face Nebraska-Omaha again at 2:30 p.m. Santa Barbara will end its weekend after its noon bout against Stanford.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, February 16, 2017 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75777\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/gauchos-back-on-road-following-subpar-season-opening-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75777\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/gauchos-back-on-road-following-subpar-season-opening-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/gauchos-back-on-road-following-subpar-season-opening-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/gauchos-back-on-road-following-subpar-season-opening-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/gauchos-back-on-road-following-subpar-season-opening-weekend/","id":1182,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[1181,1180,1179],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Struggle Mightily at Houston Hilton Plaza Invite","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-17-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-17-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB had a tough opening weekend after dropping four of their five opening matches to start the season with a 1-4 record.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After the New England Patriots were able to ride a wave of good fortune for Feb. 5’s Super Bowl, there was hope some of their luck might remain in the city for the UCSB softball team in the Houston Hilton Plaza Invitational a week later.

Gulvin then hit sophomore middle infielder Laurie Derrico and after a fly out from Paige Luellen senior first baseman Macklin Hitz rocketed one over the left field fence, bumping the lead to 5-0.</p>\n<p>Freshman pitcher Felisha Noriega replaced Gulvin at that point, finishing out the next two-and-two-thirds innings. She allowed one run in the sixth; Spring was again involved in the action. She singled to center field, knocking home sophomore utility Mauriana Jamele, who had reached to start the inning on an error by UCSB senior infielder Emily Brucelas at third base.</p>\n<p>Wichita State senior pitcher Katie Malone went the distance, pitching all seven innings and allowing eight hits, one run, and one walk while striking out five. Senior outfielder Jacqueline Hinojosa was able to get the Gauchos on the board in the fifth, singling with the bases loaded to score sophomore shortstop Melanie Menor from third, but that was the only run UCSB could muster.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s four errors were a deciding factor as the Shockers had only one more hit than the Gauchos, but they did not commit an error on the field all afternoon.</p>\n<p>The following game was over quickly as Houston took it to the Gauchos, scoring six runs in the bottom of the first inning. Loving their home field advantage, the Cougars hit through their entire lineup in the opening frame.</p>\n<p>Sophomore outfielder Elise LeBeouf singled to right field, scoring freshman utility Arielle James and advancing sophomore outfielder Maya Thomas to third, bringing up senior designated player Shelby Miller.</p>\n<p>Miller delivered, slamming a homer over the center field fence, pushing the lead to 4-0. Noriega entered her second-straight game, this time replacing junior starter Lena Mayer with only one out in the first.</p>\n<p>Freshman infielder Sarah Queen and redshirt sophomore infielder Sarah Barker were responsible for the next two runs batted in, ending the inning with six in total.</p>\n<p>LeBeouf collected two more RBI with a home run in the second inning and the Cougars again went off in the third with another five runs.</p>\n<p>Hinojosa and senior outfielder Kristen Clark accumulated the only two RBI for the Gauchos, with the former hitting in Menor for the second-straight game and the latter scoring junior outfielder Jessica Johnston on a sacrifice fly.</p>\n<p>UCSB would go through two more pitchers in the game: freshman Lilliana Rodriguez and Gulvin for the second time Friday. Houston sophomore Presley Bell would pitch the second complete game against the Gauchos that day, though the Cougars would only need five innings; a 14-2 score was enough to end the game because of the mercy rule, a deficit of 10 runs after five innings.</p>\n<p>Noriega pitched in her third-straight game Saturday, starting the 9 a.m. match against Wichita State. Seeing Noriega for the second time in two days, the Shockers jumped all over her, scoring five runs in the second inning after earning one in the first.</p>\n<p>Redshirt freshman pinch hitter Whitney Pemberton was able to homer in the fifth inning for the Gauchos, scoring freshman infielder Alyssa Diaz from first. Diaz went on to earn a RBI in the sixth on a bases-loaded walk from senior pitcher Katie Malone, though the run would be credited to the freshman starter Bailey Klitzke.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos escaped with a 12-10 victory on Saturday, rallying to score four runs in the top of the seventh inning. Freshman infielder Kayla Krantz and junior outfielder Jessica Johnston hit home runs for Santa Barbara, going 2-3 with two runs, three RBI and a walk and 2-2 with two runs and one RBI, respectively.</p>\n<p>Lilliana Rodriguez got her first win of the season in the last one-and-two-thirds innings, giving up only one hit, albeit a two-run home run. Raider junior pitcher Ashley Sharp was credited with the loss, giving up five runs — four of them earned — in three-and-a-third inning of relief work.</p>\n<p>Boston College finished off the Gauchos’ weekend by again building up an early lead in the first three innings.</p>\n<p>Junior second baseman Chloe Sharabba homered over the left field fence, which was followed one out later by senior catcher Tatiana Cortez homering to left center. Junior designated player Jordan Chimento then blasted a home run down the left-field line, hitting in three runs to push the lead to 6-1.</p>\n<p>UCSB was only able to create two runs: sophomore infielder Sierra Altmeyer when Pemberton was caught stealing in the second and Clark on a wild pitch in the sixth.</p>\n<p>Junior Jessica Dreswick pitched yet another complete game against the Gauchos, and UCSB again relied on Noriega and Gulvin to gut through another seven innings. Santa Barbara’s lack of pitching depth was very apparent on the weekend and will certainly need to improve if the Gauchos are able to turn their season around after an early funk.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play Nebraska-Omaha, Pacific, and Stanford at the Stanford Nike Invitational next weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75749\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/gauchos-struggle-mightily-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75749\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/gauchos-struggle-mightily-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/gauchos-struggle-mightily-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/gauchos-struggle-mightily-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/gauchos-struggle-mightily-at-houston-hilton-plaza-invite/","id":1181,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[1180,1179,1178],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
