While Reyes was unable to attain her degree in Chican@ Studies due to financial reasons, the graduating Class of 2015 presented it to her posthumously. Friday’s event was planned to honor those who identify as trans and have been victims of violence of hate crimes, as well as those who have fought for justice and equality for the transgender community.</p>\n<p>Director of UCSB’s Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity David Whitman said violence towards the trans community is a symptom of the group’s marginalization in daily life.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully the trans day of remembrance at UCSB can humble students to realize that oftentimes, by just being who you are, you are at risk for losing your life,” Whitman said.</p>\n<p>Whitman said the event will honor the memory of individuals who have fought against oppression.</p>\n<p>“For us to do this, it is to show that yes, number one, they matter, and number two, this is an injustice,” Whitman said.</p>\n<p>According to Whitman, events like the one taking place Friday are infrequent either because they are not widely publicized in the media or individuals are unaware of the violence trans people face.</p>\n<p>“This is something to care about, that this is an issue in our country, in our world, and hopefully [attendees] would at least be considering more, how they can be thoughtful, helpful, supportive and more loving,” Whitman said.</p>\n<p>Whitman said it is important to honor Zoraida because of her role in helping found La Familia de Colores, the only LGBTQ Chican@ organization on campus.</p>\n<p>“She created this space for people that identify in this intersection and they are feeling rightfully that it is their duty to always honor not just the founder of their group that continues to be a supportive place for Queer Chican@, trans-identified people, but also to highlight the broader issue of violence happening to trans people of color,” Whitman said.</p>\n<p>First-year psychology major Adriana Pedroza said she was inspired to advocate for marginalized groups when she attended the Trans Revolution talk featuring trans-activist Jennicet Gutierrez in November.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people don’t know about the transgender community and [that] having a day to support them allows the UCSB community to stand in solidarity and honor those who have been oppressed just for being themselves,” Pedroza said.</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Sabrina Delgado said there needs to be more leaders in the UCSB community to spread awareness about the violence trans people face.</p>\n<p>“I think the people who don’t talk about this group are not educated or are unaware of the struggles transgender people face, so attending this event on Friday to learn more about the transgender community is a way of showing that you care,” Delgado said.</p>\n<p>First-year sociology major Juan Villalobos said honoring those affected by transgender violence validates their struggle.</p>\n<p>“People still have the mentality that it’s a choice if you identify within a LGBTQ group, and it’s kind of sad that others aren’t aware of the discrimination they deal with,” Villalobos said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of the Thursday, November 19, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

Punjabi Studies Pashaura Singh presented the history of Sikhism through its social and religious evolution at the MultiCultural Center Wednesday as the first speaker of its Religious Literacy series.</p>\n<p>MCC Programmer Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said the MCC will be hosting the series to educate students on the basics of new faiths and perspectives.</p>\n<p>“The religious literary experience at UCSB’s MCC started as a result of some lock-in fees that we acquired, and now it’s this big thing,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “It’s very important in our programming every quarter to include the ‘AB’s of a faith or work on religious events to expand horizons rooted in issues that might come out of them that our students might feel connected to.”</p>\n<p>Mohsenian-Rahman said the series began with a lecture on Sikhism to break down negative stereotypes of the religion.</p>\n<p>“It was important for a lot of reasons … to kind of shatter stereotypes and misconceptions of the Sikh community in conjunction with the Muslim community in the United States, where there’s such a heightened Islamophobia targeted at Muslims and people who look like they’re Muslims,” Mohsenian- Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Singh began his talk by explaining the core values taught by the religion’s founder, Guru Nanak, who was described by Singh as “looking at the audience, always ready to have a conversation.”</p>\n<p>Singh said one of the most notable things Guru Nanak established is the concept of a free canteen within a Sikh religious building called a Langar.</p>\n<p>“It is a very powerful institution he created — when you share the food, your ideas … the dining place expands the ideas,” Singh said.</p>\n<p>Singh said Sikhism is evolving and effectively entering the mainstream.</p>\n<p>“Social media is revolutionary; all communities are changing. It’s not just the Sikhi,” Singh said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biopsychology major Jagdeep Kaur said he was taught the principles of Sikhism by his family.</p>\n<p>“Growing up, my parents taught me a lot of stuff about Sikhism. When I was younger I would go to Sunday school, and they would teach us a lot about Sikhism and the culture,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>Singh said many people, especially youth, find a connection to Sikhism because it teaches that “all human beings are equal.” Second-year communication and history of public policy double-major Jashleen Singh said she enjoys this aspect of Sikhism most.</p>\n<p>“He was talking about Langar and how everyone can go into the temple during lunch. Everyone eats together — it doesn’t matter whether you’re homeless,” Jashleen Singh said. “You don’t have to be Indian; you can be any other race and still come in. It’s a very accepting environment and a very accepting religion to have grown up with.”</p>\n<p>Attendee Emma Bobro said she came to the event to try to find a faith system she could believe in and discovered how fascinating Sikhism can be.</p>\n<p>“It’s beautiful, well, because it’s so basic. It seems more universal,” Bobro said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66456\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-13/professor-singh-speaks-on-sikhism-at-religious-literacy-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66456\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-13/professor-singh-speaks-on-sikhism-at-religious-literacy-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-13/professor-singh-speaks-on-sikhism-at-religious-literacy-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-13/professor-singh-speaks-on-sikhism-at-religious-literacy-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-13/professor-singh-speaks-on-sikhism-at-religious-literacy-series/","id":2612,"author":{"id":128,"name":"Siboney Arias"},"related":[2611,2610,2609],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Student Andres Esteban Sanchez Passes Away Sunday Morning","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image1.jpg?resize=720%2C647&ssl=1","description":"On the morning of Sunday, Oct. 11 at approximately 4:40 a.m., two IVFP deputies responded to reports of a male subject on the 6700 block of Abrego Road running in the street screaming for help.

Upon arrival, deputies were flagged down by a nearby witness who stated the male subject, later identified as UCSB student Andres “Andy” Esteban Sanchez, had a deep laceration on his right arm. When deputies first made contact with Esteban Sanchez, he was being held down by three people. One deputy removed the blanket wrapped around Esteban Sanchez’s wound and revealed a cut approximately three-quarter inches in diameter around his arm. The deputy reapplied the blanket and attempted to restrain Esteban Sanchez. Medics arrived, secured Esteban Sanchez and transported him to SB Cottage Hospital.</p>\n<p>Esteban Sanchez’s roommate said he had seen the victim earlier in the evening when he rushed into their apartment talking gibberish. One of the reporting officers visited the address, where the subject had punched through a window and cut his arm on the glass.</p>\n<p>The deputy contacted SB Cottage Hospital and provided Esteban Sanchez’s personal information.

Nyad unsuccessfully attempted the swim four times starting at age 28, with the 2013 swim being her fifth attempt in 35 years.</p>\n<p>Nyad said she thought of Cuba as “an untouchable star with a simply irresistible mystique” throughout her childhood, early swimming career and time as a professional sports journalist and commentator.</p>\n<p>Nyad said the most difficult part of her swim to Havana was nighttime, when she experienced “total sensory deprivation.”</p>\n<p>“That second night I had no idea who I was or what I was doing.” Nyad said. “I thought the blackness would never end.”</p>\n<p>Nyad said accomplishments should be viewed in terms of personal development.</p>\n<p>“When you achieve your dreams, it’s not so much about what you get but the person you become,” Nyad said. “I don’t succeed at everything I do, but I’m living this wild and precious life of mine full throttle.”</p>\n<p>UCSB alumna Kristina Hill, who just completed an open-water swim from the Channel Islands to Oxnard, attended Nyad’s talk Saturday. Hill said she admires Nyad and was excited to learn she would be in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“I’m just beginning to fall in love with this sport, and the fact that such an athletic and personal icon is here now in Santa Barbara is just awe-inspiring,” Hill said.</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Julie Keller said the talk was “extremely motivating,” but people do not necessarily need to set goals of the same scale as Nyad’s.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to note that these methods of extreme accomplishments and larger-than-life goal setting are certainly not for everyone,” Keller said.</p>\n<p>Lisa Noack, a parent of a UCSB student, said she read Nyad’s book and appreciates the idea of valuing one’s journey over the final destination.</p>\n<p>“We’re trained to get to the next level at every stage of our life and think that reaching that certain level will make us happy,” Noack said. “While brief moments of accomplishment are sweet, we forget about the deep value within the difficult, long process of accomplishing our goals. Diana truly relishes in the significance of her work while achieving what she wants.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66512\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/swimmer-speaks-on-novel-record-breaking-journey/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66512\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/swimmer-speaks-on-novel-record-breaking-journey/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/swimmer-speaks-on-novel-record-breaking-journey/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/swimmer-speaks-on-novel-record-breaking-journey/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/swimmer-speaks-on-novel-record-breaking-journey/","id":2613,"author":{"id":141,"name":"Ari Plachta"},"related":[2612,2611,2610],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
