The conference will allow members to interact with mental health experts, activists and leaders.</p>\n<p>UCSB Active Minds Co-President and fourth-year psychology major Melissa Boomer said this will be the first time in years that the UCSB chapter can attend the conference, because it is the first time the conference will be on the West Coast.</p>\n<p>“Active Minds National has been traditionally based on the East Coast,” Boomer said. “It was just really far away and really difficult to get funding for [the] long flight — things like that.”</p>\n<p>According to Boomer, the conferences are aimed at bringing Active Minds chapters together from around the country to share ideas the can help people struggling with mental health issues and combat the stigma surrounding mental health treatment.</p>\n<p>“We have the ability to seriously create really useful ideas and things that we can do to help our goals together,” Boomer said. “We get a lot of help with leadership and ideas for advocacy — ideas for getting funding since we’re a nonprofit — things like that.”</p>\n<p>Boomer said the “shining stars” of the chapters across the country will lead workshops, which the UCSB chapter will attend.</p>\n<p>“What we get from the conferences is being able to see exemplary work being done by campuses and being able to be taught by them — you know, this is what we’re doing right, so you can get all of the pieces … these [are] all really great ideas. How can we incorporate that into what we’re doing on our campus?” Boomer said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Active Minds Social Media Officer and third-year biopsychology major Crystal Groel said she looks forward to attending the workshops and meeting members of other chapters.</p>\n<p>“There are definitely things that are going to educate people on how to deal with mental illness and how to help those that are going through mental health problems,” Groel said. “It’ll be a good education for me and other people, and just being involved with a community of people who want to get the same thing you do.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Active Minds event coordinator and third-year biopsychology major Joren Adams said the Associated Students Finance and Business Committee provided funding for UCSB Active Minds to attend conference, but not every member can attend.</p>\n<p>“We basically were able to take, per finance board stipulation, nine officers and three general members, but I think that only one general member is going,” Adams said.</p>\n<p>Adams said he is looking forward to meeting students doing similar work at their institutions.<br>\n“I just think there is going to be, again, the ability to learn from other people, because we’ve isolated ourselves on campus,” Adams said. “We’re, like, kind of the only real groups that talk about mental health on our campus, so it’d be nice to meet with other groups that talk about mental health on their campus.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Active Minds member and second-year global studies major Kaylee Peterson said she joined Active Minds earlier this year after seeing the Send Silence Packing display on campus, which featured backpacks representing lives of college students lost to suicide.</p>\n<p>“I got involved with Active Minds because I think mental health is a really important issue on campus, and as well just in general in our society,” Peterson said. “I really want to learn the tools to talk about mental health and erase the stigma in our society, as well as make it a more open topic.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 12 of the Thursday, Nov. 12, issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

They planned the most recent meeting as a follow-up for those interested in joining a UCSB-based movement for stricter gun control. The group will meet again next week to discuss gun reform at the local level.</p>\n<p>Armbruster said while he believes people need time to “express their emotions” following events such as the Umpqua Community College shooting, the UCSB community needs to come together to discuss what action should be taken to advocate for stricter gun control.</p>\n<p>“I think you do need time to process, mourn and cry,” Armbruster said. “On the other hand, after you do that, there needs to be something else.”</p>\n<p>Armbruster said the pro-gun lobby has prevented gun control reform laws through “distorting” the word “freedom” and the American ideal surrounding it.</p>\n<p>“That buzzword, the discourse of just that one word, I think is so captivating, that they did a really fine job in trying to convince people that somehow, someway gun control equals lack of freedom, lack of liberty,” Armbruster said.</p>\n<p>Armbruster also said while some argue guns provide owners with protection and safety, he believes the prevalence of guns in the United States causes “insecurity.”</p>\n<p>“You never know who might be walking around here and might open up on you,” Armbruster said. “I’d rather be in a situation where I knew UCSB is gun free.”<br>\nFirst-year psychology major Jackie Rodriguez said it “frustrates” her that people in supposedly safe places, like schools, can be in danger of mass shootings.<br>\n“Like the kids from Sandy Hook, they didn’t get to have a boyfriend or girlfriend, they didn’t get to learn how to ride a bike, they didn’t get to do stuff like that,” Rodriquez said. “If I can do anything to fix that for my own children when I get older then that’s what I’m going to do.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology and history double major Katie Jacobson said she was pleased with the turnout at the meeting.</p>\n<p>“It’s nice that other people came, it wasn’t as large as the vigil but there was people who still showed up,” Jacobson said. “It was nice to hear from people that they were also sharing the same ideas that we need to do something.”</p>\n<p>Irvine said he is glad undergraduates came to the meeting to get involved because he enjoys working with them and serving as a “resource.”</p>\n<p>“They are about as bitter and jaded as I am already, but they just care,” Irvine said. “They are so passionate and I really love being around them and I love providing my knowledge.”</p>\n<p>First-year economics major Willey Campbell said he attended last week’s vigil to “pay his respects” to the victims of the shooting, but the event inspired him to engage in the gun-control movement.</p>\n<p>“Just seeing the impact that it had on everyone here made me want to come back and talk about how there should be more done about gun reforms,” Campbell said. “Having people that are very passionate about something like this that want to go out and make a change was something that was really motivating to me and something I wanted to be a part of especially as a first-year coming in.”</p>\n<p>The next meeting will be held this Thursday at 8 p.m. outside the SRB.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Associated Students Bike Committee (ASBC) and Corporal Matthew Stern from UCPD, the designated bicycle and skateboard safety officer, are largely in charge of all things bicycle related on the UCSB campus, from registration to bike path maintenance.</p>\n<p>First-year psychology major Stevi Ibonie said she bikes to and from class and has picked up on the bike traffic patterns in the three weeks she’s been on campus.<br>\n“I think that [bike paths] can be [crowded] at certain times of the day,” Ibonie said. “…people have a lot of 9 a.m.’s, so when you’re biking to your 9 a.m. class sometimes there’s a million people [on the paths] but then sometimes, when you’re biking back later in the day, like four or five, there’s not too many people and it’s kind of nice. So it kind of depends.”</p>\n<p>Third-year biopsychology major Neha Nayak said she was recently involved in a bike accident on campus.</p>\n<p>“I just got into an accident yesterday,” Nayak said. “I usually bike to campus [from Isla Vista] and then walk because I don’t like how crowded [the bike paths are]. But then I was walking, and he was going really fast, and I wasn’t looking that way, and he crashed into me, and we both got really hurt.”</p>\n<p>ASBC chair and second-year economics and accounting major Tiffany Wu said ASBC updated its Facebook page to include safety information about campus biking tips. According to Wu, inexperience with biking in crowded places and incorrect bike etiquette are the biggest causes of inefficiencies and accidents.</p>\n<p>“Biking was pretty hectic in the first few weeks when there were [first years] coming in and learning how to bike and how to navigate the bike paths,” Wu said. “Mostly, I feel like there’s not really a tradition of using hand signals at UCSB. That’s why we’re trying to navigate our committee towards a more educational path.”</p>\n<p>Stern said the biking “culture” has changed compared to when he biked on campus as a student.</p>\n<p>“Biking is what I did primarily when I came here,” Stern said. “I was also a CSO so I was on bikes pretty much 40 hours a week on campus. When I went to school here, iPods weren’t popular yet — nobody could afford them — so nobody had headphones, nobody had phones and people would actually have conversations on the bike lanes.”</p>\n<p>According to Stern, there is an alternative program for students who receive citations for breaking a bike-related law to attend a bike safety class for $35 instead of paying a fine upwards of $200.</p>\n<p>“When I was in school, we didn’t have the option of taking a class; we had to pay the whole fee of the citation … It wasn’t effective in terms of educating people,” Stern said. “We’re not out there to penalize students, we just want to make the environment safer for everybody.”</p>\n<p>Stern said the bicycle registration program deters theft and is bringing UCSB’s stolen bike recovery rate to 30-33 percent, which is six times the national average.</p>\n<p>“A bike that’s unregistered that is reported to a law enforcement agency statistically has about a one percent chance of recovery,” Stern said. “Bike registration is required on campus by law, and that’s primarily why it’s so effective. If I can get 100 percent compliance, I guarantee you we’d be recovering more bikes.”</p>\n<p>According to Stern, he is planning a new committee to reduce bike theft throughout Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“It started off informally, and it grew into a bunch of concerned community members,” Stern said. “We’ve got people from law enforcement from the sheriff’s department and the city of Santa Barbara, along with some bicycle retailers and some county personnel.”</p>\n<p>Stern also said he is planning a campaign in March tentatively called “Dude, Where’s My Bike?” and plans to use GPS bait bikes set around campus posed as normal bikes, which law enforcement will use to apprehend perpetrators if the bikes are stolen.</p>\n<p>“The idea is it’s a full month campaign during bicycle safety month,” Stern said. “[We’ll] operate our GPS bait bikes… do a sweep of the entire campus and bicycle racks, recover as many stolen bicycles as we can and identify as many thieves [as we can].”</p>\n<p>Stern says the most important thing in bike safety is to be aware of your surroundings when biking and to follow the rules of the road.</p>\n<p>“If [bikers] make a conscious effort to pay attention to their surroundings and maybe take things a little slower than they normally would, then I think that would really reduce bike accidents,” Stern said. “It’s a misconception that bicycles always have the right of way … In Isla Vista, [in] more than 90 percent of bike [and] car accidents, the bicyclist is actually found at fault.”</p>\n<p>If you have any questions bicycle or skateboard related, email Corp.

hosted the “21st Century Ecosocialism Conference” in Girvetz Hall this weekend to discuss potential solutions to the climate crises.</p>\n<p>SCNCC is a coalition of ecosocialists from the U.S. and Canada who believe a move away from capitalism is necessary to combat climate change. According to SCNCC, climate change is especially a threat to the poor, women, people of color and those who live in the Global South. After an initial introduction on Friday night, the conference held various workshops, plenary sessions and activities to encourage sharing ideas that challenge the current system. Over 20 workshops were held throughout the weekend, each offering a slightly different perspective on the various issues of poverty, environment and human rights.<br>\nOrganizer and UCSB professor of sociology John Foran said a graduate student in his sociology class, Earth in Crisis, inspired him to join SCNCC. According to Foran, climate change is a result of capitalism and requires a better, more extensive solution.</p>\n<p>“I learned about [SCNCC] and I thought this was more or less what I think about the climate crisis — that it needs a deep systemic solution, a radical solution,” Foran said. “The climate crisis cannot be solved within the logic of capitalism or globalization as we know it — it’s too big and caused by the normal operation of those systems.”</p>\n<p>Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein addressed the audience through Skype, and said there needs to be a “comprehensive solution for a comprehensive problem” that solves issues of climate change as well as social inequality.</p>\n<p>“We need solutions that address jobs that address climate, that address racial justice,” Stein said. “Ecology is pitted against our economy and our jobs and this is a false divide, so it’s very important we put out solutions that meet it and that we take on the economic crisis at the same time as the environment.”<br>\nAccording to Stein, there should be increased financial aid for students who struggle to pay for higher education.</p>\n<p>“About two-thirds of all college students, both current and former, are in disabling debt because their jobs do not provide enough to pay back that debt,” Stein said. “We are not only calling for free public higher education but also to abolish student debt. It is critical to bail out of students to liberate our younger generation to be the leaders that they must be.”</p>\n<p>Seattle City Council member Kshama Sawant delivered a short speech through a YouTube video and said the current capitalistic economy and political systems prioritize profits and neglect people and the environment.</p>\n<p>“This is the reality of international capitalism,” Sawant said. “This is the product of the gigantic casino of speculation created by those highway robbers on Wall Street and the rapacious oil vultures. In this system, the market is God and everything is sacrificed on the altar of profit.”</p>\n<p>Foran said the title of the conference combines the need for social equality and to preserve the environment to form the term “ecosocialism.”</p>\n<p>“Socialism, translated into what it means in my heart, means trying to create a more equal society,” Foran said. “It means fighting against the gross inequality that exists in the world today. Ecosocialism brings in the climate crisis part … By 21st-century ecosocialism, we mean a new kind of ecosocialism that is explicitly and deeply democratic. It’s a way of saying we don’t think there’s enough democracy in the world today.”</p>\n<p>According to Foran, the conference cultivates interest in those who are just discovering the movement and connects them with long-time activists.</p>\n<p>“This conference brings together our undergrads, who are starting to have a little interest in the climate crisis, with people who are up and down the coast of all generations, who are seasoned ecosocialists,” Foran said. “Out of these chance encounters grow relationships and new knowledge and new passion.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65232\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/ucsb-hosts-ecosocialism-conference-in-girvetz/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65232\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/ucsb-hosts-ecosocialism-conference-in-girvetz/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/ucsb-hosts-ecosocialism-conference-in-girvetz/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/ucsb-hosts-ecosocialism-conference-in-girvetz/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-12/ucsb-hosts-ecosocialism-conference-in-girvetz/","id":2684,"author":{"id":154,"name":"Christopher Chen"},"related":[2683,2682,2681],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
