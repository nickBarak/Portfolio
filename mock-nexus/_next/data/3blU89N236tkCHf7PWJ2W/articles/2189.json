The UCen Governance Board will hear presentations from various businesses and ultimately vote on which one to rent to.</p>\n<p>The board will put together a Request for Proposal (RFP), in which they will “choose a specific type of business that [they] want to go after” or leave options more open-ended, Lawrence said.</p>\n<p>The space is unusual in that it does not have a kitchen and instead has a classroom. Before Kaplan occupied it, the space was filled by various travel agencies.</p>\n<p>“It’s a very weird space,” Rose Ettleson, undergraduate representative on the board, said. “I can’t even think off the top of my head who to occupy that space.”</p>\n<p>Ettleson, a fourth-year environmental studies and film and media studies double major, expressed concerns about the possibility of UCPD filling the space.</p>\n<p>“As undergraduate students on this campus, police presence is something that is not always welcomed,” she said, noting that the UCPD inquiry was still in the “very beginning stages.”</p>\n<p>“Obviously I don’t want there to be just one option unless it really seems like a good option.”</p>\n<p>UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson said in an email that if they were to secure the space, it would primarily be used for “community policing and [a] Community Service Officer (CSO) station.”</p>\n<p>Currently, UCPD’s station is a 20-minute walk from the center of campus.</p>\n<p>“This space could enable the UC Police Department and its members to more effectively and routinely interact with the campus community in non-enforcement contacts.”</p>\n<p>Olson said the appeal of the space is its central location on campus and its proximity to other campus organizations and entities.</p>\n<p>While UCPD has not submitted a formal proposal, Olson listed the task as a priority for 2019, along with identifying a source of funding if UCPD is chosen.</p>\n<p>The space does not have a fixed rent, Lawrence said, although Kaplan paid approximately $8.50 per square foot.</p>\n<p>For now, the campus bookstore will use the space at the beginning of Winter Quarter for the book reservation program that they typically hold in the lobby.</p>\n<p>Lawrence hopes the board can find an entity to fill the space as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>“We just would like to find somebody who’s willing to pay the most rent possible,” he joked.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Food Co-op, the Transfer Student Center and Associated Students Food Bank.</p>\n<p>“We love working with our campus and community partners because they all bring their unique ideas, strengths and expertise to the table,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>In Fall Quarter 2018, over 530 students attended FNBS events, Ovalle said.</p>\n<p>“Every quarter we put on approximately two workshops per week,” Ovalle said. “[These workshops] help improve food security on campus through education but more specifically through helping promote healthy food, easy access, educational content to increase food security and teaching skills.”</p>\n<p>In addition to the new hands-on cooking classes, FNBS will continue to offer a variety of nutrition and wellness-related programs, including garden and grocery tours as well as cooking demonstrations.</p>\n<p>Garden tours teach students how to plant seeds to grow their own vegetables and herbs. Similarly, FNBS hosts tours of the I.V. Food Co-op, in which students learn about unit pricing, using coupons and shopping in bulk.</p>\n<p>Approximately 48 percent of the university’s undergraduate students experience some degree of food insecurity, according to a University of California Global Food Initiative report from Dec. 2017.</p>\n<p>“Cooking doesn’t need to be expensive, and it doesn’t need to be complex,” Ovalle said. “Cooking can save you tons of money, it can be a whole lot healthier and it can be a lot of fun.”</p>\n<p>Student can sign up for workshops <a href=\"http://wellness.sa.ucsb.edu/fnbs\">here</a>.

now, Sorin would have an advisory role in the process, while Interim Title IX Coordinator Suzanne Taylor would have the final say on who UCSB’s representative is.</p>\n<p>By boycotting, Sorin will refuse to take part in the selection process for a new representative.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the association as a whole will not recognize any new board members until the board “acknowledges some structural changes need to be made and begin the process of making them,” said Raphael Chinchilla, GSA vice president for academic affairs.</p>\n<p>Selvidge resigned from her position as UCSB’s graduate student representative on the Title IX student advisory board in November following <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-08/ucsb-graduate-rep-resigns-from-title-ix-student-advisory-board/\">disagreements</a> with the UC Office of the President (UCOP).</p>\n<p>These disagreements arose after the Nexus reported on <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/\">Selvidge’s interpretation</a> of the new Title IX policy changes.</p>\n<p>She resigned a few days later, drafting a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Selvidge-Title-IX-Student-Advisory-Boar...signation-Letter-11-2-18-Google-Docs.pdf\">lengthy resignation letter</a> and releasing it to the public by way of the nowUCSB Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Selvidge also spoke heavily during Tuesday’s meeting, speaking to both her experience on the Title IX board as well as why she chose to resign.</p>\n<p>“From our perspective, this is sort of a free speech issue,” Selvidge said. “If we cannot appoint our own independent representative… we can’t be certain that we’re actually going to get a representative who truly represents the graduate population, and that is concerning.”</p>\n<p>Sorin added to Selvidge’s points, claiming the board and UCOP have tried “to bully us into compliance with them, which I’m super not fucking down with.”</p>\n<p>“From our perspective and what happened with Jenny, [the Title IX Student Advisory Board] not only does not welcome dissent, but has actively tried to crush it,” Sorin said during the meeting.</p>\n<p>“If you do not agree with what the Office of the President’s perspective is on the Title IX policy, and you are vocal about that, you will be removed.”</p>\n<p>The board, which was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/student-advisory-board-formed-for-title-ix-issues/\">created in Nov. 2017</a>, aims to help clarify Title IX policies for students across the UC system.</p>\n<p>The board’s current head is Taylor, who took over following the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/first-uc-system-wide-title-ix-coordinator-resigns/\">resignation</a> of previous coordinator Kathleen Salvaty.</p>\n<p>UCSB is now the only UC without any representation on the board. UCSB has not had a say in board decisions for almost a month.</p>\n<p>“The university is continuing its search for UCSB representatives to serve on the Student Advisory Board,” Claire Doan, UCOP director of media relations, said in an email.</p>\n<p>Taylor forwarded the <em>Nexus</em>‘ request for comment to Doan.</p>\n<p><em>Correction [Dec. 12]: The vote passed with one abstention, not zero.

She also spoke of where the movement stands now, a year after #MeToo gained viral attention.</p>\n<p>In the larger political sphere, Burke’s presence on campus was timely; introduction speaker Celesta Billeci, Arts &amp; Lectures Executive Director, noted Burke’s appearance was just one day before the midterm elections where more women ran for office at record numbers.</p>\n<p>Burke weaved together anecdotes of her activism in a lecture that was surprisingly humorous, given the heavy nature of the topic of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>What was unsurprising was the humanity and personal touch, as seen in both her lecture and at a reception held immediately before. The reception, held in the Mosher Alumni House, welcomed a group of 40 to speak to Burke before her Campbell Hall Lecture.</p>\n<p>Students were selected to attend the reception through the Black Studies and Feminist Studies Departments, which co-hosted the event.</p>\n<p>Burke went from table to table during the Mosher House reception, asking about students’ majors.</p>\n<p>She also reflected to the group on what the #MeToo movement still has to accomplish.</p>\n<p>“It just pains me that survivors have been forgotten. We have built this movement on the stories of survivors…for what?”</p>\n<p>C.A.R.E. peer educator Jasmine Wahab described speaking with Burke as shocking.</p>\n<p>“She’s just so influential, so incredible,” Wahab said.</p>\n<p>Burke’s lecture focused not only on her own work in activism, but how the #MeToo movement has changed since its viral re-emergence in 2016. The Kavanaugh hearings in September were a reminder to Burke of how much work remains in the national conversation around sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“I thought that we were further along than we were… [the Kavanaugh hearings were] a missed opportunity to examine what accountability looks like,” Burke said.</p>\n<p>Burke said the hearings became too partisan, and that led to people forgetting the greater message regarding Kavanaugh’s behavior.</p>\n<p>“There’s a straight line in my mind between a 17-year-old Kavanaugh… who was not told ‘no’ very often, and the 57-year-old man who has an unchecked amount of power and can make choices about my body,” she said.</p>\n<p>In her lecture, Burke spoke candidly about the difference between the media’s perceptions of the #MeToo movement and the work which the organization is accomplishing, which she described as #MeToo “writ large and writ little.”</p>\n<p>Those who see the #MeToo movement as just a hashtag are only seeing the “writ large,” according to Burke.</p>\n<p>Over 12 million people posted #MeToo on Facebook just 24 hours after its use by actress Alyssa Milano on Oct.15, 2017, but Burke reminded the audience that “every single hashtag is a human being.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84863\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84863\" data-attachment-id=\"84863\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-11/metoo-founder-tarana-burke-speaks-at-ucsb/jenny-luo_tarana-burke_online-7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Jenny Luo_Tarana Burke_ONLINE-7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-84863 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84863\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Burke spoke to a full crowd Tuesday night.<em> Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Burke does not view the #MeToo movement as sustainable if it remains tied only to social media.</p>\n<p>“What they have done is not sustainable, not a movement, but a reaction to a moment. […] it’s a distraction from our real work,” she said.</p>\n<p>Sustainability comes from #MeToo “writ little,” which includes everything behind the hashtag.</p>\n<p>“Me Too is a global community of survivors committed to healing and action, including marginalized survivors of all identities, including queer and trans. The rest is a distraction from that,” Burke said.</p>\n<p>“Do recognize the urgency of this movement. Think of those waiting to be seen, to be heard, to be believed.”</p>\n<p>Burke plans soon to expand #MeToo mission beyond the hashtag. New work including survivor leadership training will be unveiled in January 2019, while a new website will be completed in April.</p>\n<p>“[The website will be] the most comprehensive website for survivors of sexual violence,” Burke said, to the eruption of applause from the audience.</p>\n<p>While #MeToo is about the stories of individuals, Burke emphasized in her lecture that the movement emphasizes community healing, changing the culture of sexual violence through law and policy changes.</p>\n<p>This change in culture can happen at the college level, Burke said.</p>\n<p>She personalized her message on Monday to UCSB in particular by reading UCSB’s mission statement aloud, describing the commitment to sustainability as brilliant.</p>\n<p>Burke also challenged the administration to examine how UCSB’s policies regarding sexual assault can fit this mission. The power in the mission statement, according to Burke, is having a “clear guide to create policies and shift culture.”</p>\n<p>“Students, this is built around you. Not the founders, not the board of trustees. You have the power now.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
