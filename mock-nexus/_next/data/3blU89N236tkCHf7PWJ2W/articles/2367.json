President Donald Trump announced on Sept. 3 that he intends to promptly repeal the program afterward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though many undocumented students have spoken vehemently against Trump’s repeal, Islas</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> actually glad the administration is repealing the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The repeal is a “wake-up call” to undocumented youth that DACA was never permanent, said Islas, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fourth-year history of public policy major at UCSB</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said students can now begin to address flaws in immigration legislation and focus on the rights of the entire undocumented community, not only students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Other than just fighting for undocumented students, we need to be fighting for all undocumented individuals in this country,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Thursday renewal deadline is only for DACA recipients whose applications expire on or before March 5, 2018. The administration may not announce an extended deadline for the undocumented youth whose applications expire after that date.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Islas’s application expires after the March deadline and she said she may not renew her application if an additional renewal date is scheduled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t favor DACA,” she said. “It’s this whole complacency that’s taken part within the community. We just forget about other people’s struggles and other people’s narratives.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former President Barack Obama signed DACA into law with an executive order in 2012. Since the program’s introduction, the UC has admitted thousands of recipients.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over 800,000 young people in the United States are DACA recipients and approximately 4,000 undocumented students attend a UC campus, according to the UC Office of the President.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Islas said she understood the benefits of DACA when she began school at UC Santa Barbara and was hired for an on-campus job. She said, however, that she still lives in “a constant state of fear” because DACA does not protect all members of her family, including her mother.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Coming from someone who has an undocumented mother, I worry more about her than I worried about myself,” Islas said. “DACA never protected my mom and that was my biggest concern.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution Tuesday in support of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DACA</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supervisors Janet Wolf, Joan Hartmann and Das Williams were the resolution’s staunchest supporters; supervisors Steve Lavagnino and Peter Adam, however, abstained from voting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third District Supervisor Hartmann said while the resolution was primarily a symbolic gesture, she believes symbols are “vitally important” for local communities to impact the federal government’s policies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To me, the resolution was a statement that the County values our Dreamers and we have a welcome sign at the door,” Hartmann said in an email. “They should know that we want to invest in their futures because they are critical to the County’s future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security on Sept. 8 in response to President Trump’s repeal of DACA. Napolitano alleged that the “unlawful” repeal violated the rights of the people that benefit from the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC also allocates $2.5 million per year for undocumented student fellowships under Napolitano’s D.R.E.A.M. loan initiative, and grants the UC’s Undocumented Legal Services Center $900,000 per year under the Undocumented Student Services Program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The United States Supreme Court recently turned down a case challenging the UC Regents’ decision to allow undocumented students access to financial aid and pay in-state tuition fees in California.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President Trump has given the DACA repeal to Congress, which can suggest a replacement for DACA in six months before the president officially abolishes the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Islas said while she does not trust Congress, the best form of a new system for the undocumented community would include an updated D.R.E.A.M. Act without the enforcement of border security and detention centers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some safety coming from legislation would be abolishing detention centers,” Islas said. “But I don’t believe the liberation of the undocumented community comes from a piece of legislation.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make sure there’s something that’s viable that protects the 11 million [undocumented immigrants],” she added. “It’s not impossible.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A version of this article

id=\"caption-attachment-78989\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">While the SB fire department typically gets 15 to 20 fire alarms per month, they were alerted to 12 fire alarms in a 10-day period at the beginning of Fall Quarter. / Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Twelve fire alarms went off between Sept. 24 and Oct. 3, according to Mike Eliason, SB Fire spokesperson. On average, the fire department typically responds to 10 to 15 fire alarms per month.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Eliason said the fire department responded to 51 calls on campus and in Isla Vista in the same time period, 39 of which were emergencies and 12 of which were alarms.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He said the increase in alarms could be attributed to the increase in people using campus facilities, although there is no “long-term discernible pattern” as to why alarms go off as often as they do. According to Eliason, most calls happen on Friday and Saturday night in I.V.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Eliason said fire alarms are often triggered in various ways. One fire crew member claimed a spider had even triggered one alarm.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“There have been times where literally a spider crawls up inside and sets off a sensor,” Eliason said in an email.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The fire department responded to two calls provoked by the smell of dust from a construction site on campus Tuesday. During the school year, alarms are often set off by burnt popcorn or rice in communal kitchens.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“There are more people using hot plates [and] making microwave popcorn than in the summer,” Eliason said in an email. “Take for instance yesterday’s call with the dust. In the summer, someone might not have been there (as it turned out) to pull the alarm.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The only damage in these situations is “slight embarrassment” for the person who pulled the alarm, Eliason said, but it is best to be cautious.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“We do not mind responding to these calls, that is why we are here, to serve the public. We send a lot of resources to calls, because we can always turn them back if they aren’t needed,” he said in an email.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He said pulling false fire alarms “very rarely occurs” at UCSB. Pulling a false fire alarm in California is a felony and can include a punishment of imprisonment, a fine of no less than $500, no more than $10,000 or both, according to state law.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Annual Fire Prevention Week is Oct. 8 to 14 and the county fire department’s focus this year is preparation, according to Eliason.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Every second counts in a fire, he said, and can “mean the difference between residents of our community escaping safely from a fire or having their lives end in tragedy.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">To prevent fires, the county fire department recommends drawing a map of one’s home and marking two exits for each room, as well as a path outside.</p>\n<p>In the event of a fire, the fire department also recommends closing doors while evacuating a building since it can possibly slow down the spread of smoke, heat and fire. Numbers on your home’s apartment should be clearly marked so firefighters may easily locate a fire when it occurs.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page three of the October 5, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79001\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/spike-in-fire-alarms-emergency-calls-after-first-week-of-school/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79001\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/spike-in-fire-alarms-emergency-calls-after-first-week-of-school/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/spike-in-fire-alarms-emergency-calls-after-first-week-of-school/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/spike-in-fire-alarms-emergency-calls-after-first-week-of-school/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/spike-in-fire-alarms-emergency-calls-after-first-week-of-school/","id":2364,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2363,2362,2361],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"$48 Fix: A.S.

According to the $48 Fix report, tuition could be free for university and college students in California with the implementation of a statewide income surtax of $48 per year for the median California taxpayer.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While the Senate’s approval of the resolution is primarily symbolic, it will prompt action from the executive branches of A.S. to hold campus-based campaigns, UC Student Association and U.S. Student Association meetings, as well as lobby visits with state representatives to gain support for the plan throughout the state.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I would like to see people direct their energy and anger to their local legislators,” Woodrow Davidson, EVPSA deputy chief of staff and one of the resolution’s student sponsors, said. “That’s where people need to begin ramping up the pressure. In the end, it has to pass through the state.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The resolution was the first item on the agenda at the senate’s first meeting of the year and was authored by senators Dhishal Jayasinghe and Andrea Reyes.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Tuition [that is] free is not a ridiculous idea,” Reyes told the <i>Nexus </i>on<i> </i>Tuesday. “It’s something that is possible in our state.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Reyes is a transfer student and said the cost of a public university was the primary reason she chose to attend a community college before coming to UC Santa Barbara. She said, however, that she believes even the cost of community college can be a financial burden for many students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Spencer Brandt, one of the resolution’s student sponsors, said in a changing world and economy, the state must invest in higher education and not only fund K-12 education.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It’s important to have [senate’s] support to continue the movement for free college in California and gather momentum at the grassroots level,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Davidson told the <i>Nexus</i> on Tuesday he planned to attend a community college after high school because of its affordability, but his father encouraged him to attend UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He reminded the senate at the meeting that a UC, California State University and community college education was originally free. He said he believes the current political climate of instability presents students with an opportunity to make important changes at the higher levels of government.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“This is the moment that we seize on,” Davidson said. “This is the moment that we can truly make a better future for not just ourselves but for the people who will be coming here years down the road.”</p>\n<p><em>Anjalie Tandon contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 5, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The new charging stations, installed in parking lots 58 and 59 for the San Joaquin Apartments and Santa Catalina Residence Halls, are exclusively for UCSB-owned vehicles.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The university currently has 28 charging stations for faculty, student and visitor use in parking lots 10, 18, 22 and 60. In addition to the electric chargers, there are 34 stations on campus.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Each two-space charging station costs approximately $10,000, according to James Wagner, program manager for transportation and parking services. The university pays an additional $250 per year for each space in network connection fees.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The university may also install charging stations in parking lot 31 at the end of the calendar year after assessing the total costs of the project.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Many university staff and faculty members charge their vehicle while at work if they do not have an electric car charger at home.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Rates for the charging stations vary depending on their location and power level. Level one is the most basic power level and level two is six times as powerful as the first level, Wagner said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Level one power is $1 for every four hours, with a 12-hour maximum. Level two power costs $1 per hour with a 10-hour maximum in most parking structures. Level two power in Lot 60 costs $0.20 per kilowatt hour.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Wagner said the university primarily relies on grants to fund the charging stations.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Organizations such as the California Department of Energy, the California Public Utilities Commission, the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District and the Green Initiatives Fund of UCSB provide the funding.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The vehicle charging stations are not a source of revenue for the university, Wagner said, adding that the fee users pay to charge their vehicles is distributed to the stations’ maintenance, payment processing fees and the network connection fees.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">UCSB housing and dining services installed the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment in Lots 58, 59 and 60.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Wagner said the charging station installation process does not take longer than a week, especially if the underground wiring is already in place.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to data collected by the university’s transportation and parking services department, the use of electric energy has steadily increased since they were first installed in 2012. This year, approximately 125 megawatts hours (MWh) were distributed by the electric vehicle charging stations.</p>\n<p>According to the California New Car Dealers Association’s quarterly report released in May 2017, 4.8 percent of new vehicles registered in California in the first three months of 2017 were zero-emission vehicles and plug-in hybrids.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">Correction: </span><span class=\"s1\">The university pays $250 per year in network connection fees, not electric connection fees, as the article previously stated. The article was also corrected to clarify that energy is measured in megawatt hours, not megawatts per hour. </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\"> </span></em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79005\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-gets-new-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-bringing-total-to-34/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79005\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-gets-new-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-bringing-total-to-34/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-gets-new-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-bringing-total-to-34/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-gets-new-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-bringing-total-to-34/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-gets-new-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-bringing-total-to-34/","id":2365,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2364,2363,2362],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
