The facility has submitted a plan to the CCC that aims to relocate the stables. <em>Min Xie / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Located near West Campus and the Devereux Slough, the property is home to an historic barn originally built in the 1920s as part of the Campbell Estate. It is now part of the UCSB Horse Boarders Association (HBA).</p>\n<p>According to the updated LRDP, the area that houses the facility will be restored to natural wetlands, although the HBA says the area has not functioned as a wetland in hundreds of years.</p>\n<p>Members are concerned the property is being used as “leverage” for the university to gain approval on future development projects from the California Coastal Commission (CCC).</p>\n<p>UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada, said, however, that the stable is located on environmentally sensitive area of campus.</p>\n<p>“Due to the sensitive nature of the area, the California Coastal Commission has required the campus to plan for the removal of the stable facilities,” she said. “They have given us 10 years to remove the facility.”</p>\n<p>Estrada said the university also submitted a Manure Management Plan to the CCC on March 25, 2015, to allow possible relocation of the horse stables. The report outlines the monthly removal of manure from community horse arenas, efforts to minimize runoff to the wetlands and that horse stalls be cleaned weekly and communal areas (such as turnouts) be cleaned four times a week.</p>\n<p>Jenny Dugan, UCSB associate research biologist and HBA faculty advisor, works very closely with the CCC and submitted the Manure Management Plan to the CCC on March 25, 2015.</p>\n<p>Holly Nuovo, senior environmental studies major and treasurer of HBA, considers the plan pivotal to UCSB’s sustainability plan. “I know they include our manure tonnage in their sustainability reports, so whenever they’re talking about waste management, part of that is about us,” she said.</p>\n<p>The all natural and organic manure is donated to the Indigenous Gardening Club and other gardening communities in the area, making the reuse of the manure beneficial to UCSB’s sustainability plan.</p>\n<p>The CCC is a state organization that regulates the university’s developments. They aim to protect environmentally sensitive habitats, requiring the university to restore one area in tandem with any new development in the coastal area, like the Sierra Madre housing. The CCC could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>The HBA has been active since the 1970s and has been fighting forced closures by the university since the 1990s. They have halted definitive closures by pressuring the chancellor’s office with an influx of letters intended to emphasize their value to the community.</p>\n<p>“They think that what we offer doesn’t have enough value, and so they can promise the Coastal Commission that they’ll remove our activity and restore the natural habitat in order to get approval for their other development projects,” said Nuovo.</p>\n<p>LRDP regulations prevent the HBA from changing the aerial view of the barn by creating any new permanent structures, repairs or effectively altering the “footprint” of the barn.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75779\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75779\" data-attachment-id=\"75779\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/horse-1-by-min-xie/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Horse 1 by Min Xie\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-75779\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-75779\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The stables, located near West Campus and Devereaux Slough, sit atop environmentally sensitive areas.<br>Because of this, the campus has been tasked with closing the facilities down within the next 10 years. <em>Min Xie / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The LRDP restrictions maintain that repairs cannot result in the demolition or reconstruction of 50 percent or more of any structure. The facility also abides by the CCC’s environmental sustainability regulations.</p>\n<p>Lauren Rudnick, a second-year mechanical engineering major and member of the HBA, is currently making repairs to her horse’s stable and is mainly concerned with the longevity and safety of the stall.</p>\n<p>“These restrictions make it difficult to fully repair anything,” Rudnick said, adding that from a legal standpoint, the restrictions could be at fault if the animals or caretakers are harmed.</p>\n<p>Sitting about 300 to 400 yards away from the edge of the horse facility is a wetland buffer zone that the Coastal Commission closely maintains.</p>\n<p>The HBA has planted blackberries, Bermuda grass and other native bushes around the stalls and the buffer zone. The plants absorb nitrogen and other plant-growing material to filter the runoff from the horse’s manure so no harm comes to the wetlands.</p>\n<p>“It is possible to co-exist with the slough. We are doing it now,” Nuovo said.</p>\n<p>Existing restrictions to build in the area because of native burial sites and environmental concerns make the area convenient to use as “leverage,” Nuovo said. Pressure from UC Regents to make campuses larger put the university in a position to follow through with the closure.</p>\n<p>It would take roughly 20 years or more for the area to be restored as a wetland. The slough does not naturally reach the facility, so major excavations would occur for water to reach the area.</p>\n<p>“They use this land as a tool to return to the environment, but I honestly feel that what we do here helps the students integrate into the environment and the community at whole so much better than just returning it straight to wetland,” Nouvo said, adding that the facility offers affordable horse boarding opportunities to students that could not otherwise afford it.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, February 16, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75806\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75806\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/","id":2720,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2719,2718,2717],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio","biography":"Not available","articles":[2295,2312,2322,2324,2328,2330,2357,2358,2388,2393,2394,2395,2397,2399,2408,2718,2720,2772,3572,3612,3654,3768,3803,3822,3826,3923,3924,3929,3959,4360,4444],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Solar Origami Takes First at Startup Competition","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=800%2C600&ssl=1","description":"When Robert Salazar, an origami artist of 16 years, first pitched the idea of marketing an origami solar cooker named Orisun, not too many students could get behind it.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>When Robert Salazar, an origami artist of 16 years, first pitched the idea of marketing an origami solar cooker named Orisun, not too many students could get behind it.</p>\n<p>Aspiring entrepreneurs like Salazar were asked to vote on pitches to decide which would become finalists.

So I put all my stickers on.”</p>\n<p>So began the team that would go on to win first place at Startup Weekend, a two-day program on the weekend of Jan. 15-17 in which students launched entrepreneurial projects from scratch.</p>\n<p>Orisun was one of a handful of products to make it to the finals on Sunday, Jan. 17. One team proposed an app called Open, which allows users to keep track of drunk friends. Another group proposed Physique, an app in which users do workouts based on how they want to look.</p>\n<p>The fitness app won third place and Open won second, but the Orisun team placed above the rest because they built a functional prototype on the day of presentation.</p>\n<p>The team developed a simple product: Orisun is a foldable solar reflector able to melt snow on backpacking trips. Users can fold the device into a large cup, and when deployed, Orisun unravels to three-and-a-half feet in diameter. Light rays from the sun hit the shiny Mylar surface, which directs them into a central column for users to heat up water, snow or food.</p>\n<p>Salazar created the circular origami figure made of paper and Mylar on the morning of Sunday, Jan. 17 — the same day the team intended to present. When demonstrated, the Orisun prototype was able to heat up water by one degree every two seconds.</p>\n<p>Judges also commended the Orisun team for making presales and meeting with representatives from REI, Patagonia and National Geographic.</p>\n<p>“We validated our market research maybe a little bit better than others because we actually got money and funding,” Sato said. “That’s one of the best ways to gauge whether people are really going to buy this.”</p>\n<p>She said the team’s competitor sells its product for about $80 to $120, but Orisun can have a market price of $45 to $60. Now, the target market price is somewhere under $100.</p>\n<p>“We have a cheaper solution that has potentially more applications,” she said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75229\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75229\" data-attachment-id=\"75229\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/solar-origami-takes-first-at-startup-competition/startup-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Startup 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75229\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=800%2C600\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-75229\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Robert Salazar</em></p></div>\n<p>According to the Orisun team, the applications for their product are broad. It serves a recreational purpose, able to assist a lifestyle of backpacking and trekking. Sailors can use Orisun to heat up ocean water for desalination.</p>\n<p>Team member Srikanth Kalluri, a third-year physics major, said he joined the team because he saw the application of Orisun as an assistance to third-world countries.

Aída Hurtado’s seat was between two women who used all of their frequent flier miles and took extraordinary measures to make it to the protest.</p>\n<p>Hurtado said her job as an academic was to be present that day, but “here was a plane full of individual citizens with no support or structures to ensure their participation in the March; they were simply answering the call of what they thought was right and moral.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the five-hour flight, Hurtado and the two women she met on board confided in each other about the political and social consequences women would face from the new presidential administration.</p>\n<p>Organizers of the march put together a panel of over 40 celebrities and activists including Angela Davis and Scarlett Johansson to speak against President Trump’s administration and his rhetoric toward women and marginalized communities. UC Santa Barbara professor Aída Hurtado was set to speak among those high profile speakers.</p>\n<p>As the department chair of Chicano and Chicana studies, Hurtado’s work has focused primarily on gender equality and Chicana feminism. For her, the Women’s March had a clear purpose: women are not going to give back their rights and they will not stand down.</p>\n<p>She was invited to speak at the march by organizer Carmen Perez, who studied under Hurtado in the early 2000s at UC Santa Cruz. Perez became her research assistant after taking Hurtado’s undergraduate course in Chicana feminism.</p>\n<p>Hurtado said feminism and criminal justice have molded most of Perez’s career. Perez is the executive director of the nonprofit Gathering for Justice, founded by Harry Belafonte.</p>\n<p>In the midst of so many high status speeches and the 470,000 people that were marching, Hurtado did not think there would be time for her to speak. She thought that if unscheduled guests like Madonna had not gone up to speak at that point, then she wouldn’t either.</p>\n<p>The program was running behind so she decided to put away her typed speech and enjoy the moment. Taking in the grandeur of that day was important to her, she said. She was watching her former student navigate a historic movement.</p>\n<p>A few moments later, Perez texted Hurtado and told her not to leave the stage because she was going up after Madonna.</p>\n<p>Her original speech was going to be about the incredible “feminist victories” throughout history: obtaining the right to vote, abortion and contraceptive rights and sexual harassment legislation were just some of the topics that Hurtado was going to mention. She found it necessary to highlight women’s “efficacy and resilience.”</p>\n<p>But, when she approached the podium, she chose not to give that speech. Instead she spoke on Perez’s accomplishments. Hurtado said, if it were not for public education, which is under potential threat by the new presidential administration, Perez would not be here today to organize the momentous demonstration.</p>\n<p>Hurtado expressed the significance the UC system has in the world as a public institution. “We are one of the biggest public university systems in the world,” she said, “and there is a risk that it could be privatized.”</p>\n<p>Hurtado was referring to President Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Education, Elizabeth “Betsy” DeVos. DeVos has a history of being tied to the privatization of education. According to The Atlantic, DeVos’s family poured $1.45 million into preventing Michigan from adding oversight for charter schools.</p>\n<p>The racial divide in the country was also a concern to Hurtado. To her, it is homogenizing to say that white women were the only ones at the march when the participants were diverse in age, gender and race.</p>\n<p>According to Hurtado, the media was expecting a strategic formula to what the march itself achieved. But she doesn’t believe social change is that simple. It isn’t effective to expect a simple equation to define how social change works, she said.</p>\n<p>Hurtado wants the focus on the fact that individual citizens showed up and said “not in my name; you are not going to do this to us.”</p>\n<p>According to Al Jazeera’s Trump Tracker, within the first five days of Trump’s presidency he has already passed a bill with the support of the House to stop federal funding for abortion and block tax credits for individuals and businesses buying abortion coverage under federal health care law. The anti-abortion bill was originally enacted during the Reagan administration and has since been revived by every Republican president after him and subsequently dismantled by every Democratic president.</p>\n<p>The “dismantling” that the administration is doing instead of “building” is her main concern. She said she doesn’t think we should have a “list” of demands just yet when there are so many executive orders being made to take away more of citizens’ rights.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know what’s going to happen, but what did happen was magical,” she said. “I want to sit on that for a while.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressman Salud Carbajal spoke at UCSB on Monday about the difficulty of passing Democratic legislation in a Republican-majority Congress. <em>Anthony Lai/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Carbajal expressed hesitant hope for progressive legislation under the Trump administration but attempted to ensure the town hall attendees that he would do what he could despite being a Democrat in a Republican-majority congress.</p>\n<p>The congressman has sponsored or co-sponsored over 60 bills since being elected to Congress in November and said 25 of the bills have been bipartisan.</p>\n<p>“I still believe there’s always room for collaboration,” he said, despite the currently divided political climate.</p>\n<p>The town hall, hosted by the Associated Students Environmental Affairs Board, was divided into three sections of discussion: the environment, education and immigration. Many of the attendees’ concerns focused on how the Trump administration’s new and proposed policies would impact these issues.</p>\n<p>Carbajal addressed a student’s question regarding how he would combat the president’s budget cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency’s office of research and development. He said he would continue to “speak out” against harmful legislation.</p>\n<p>“The reality is that I am in the minority party right now, and one party controls both chambers of Congress and the White House,” Carbajal said. “So what we can do is put forth legislation, which oftentimes cannot move forward, and develop bipartisan support to bring it forward for a hearing to bring it to the floor.”</p>\n<p>Many students asked questions about issues affecting students, including food insecurity, tuition and loans.</p>\n<p>Carbajal said since Trump’s proposed budget cuts funding to programs that help combat students’ food insecurity, he has sponsored an appropriations bill request for more funding for food banks.</p>\n<p>Carbajal went on to address college tuition hikes and the advent of paying off student loans after graduation. The congressman, a UCSB alumnus, said he still has not paid off all his student loans.</p>\n<p>Carbajal said he has supported an appropriations bill to increase the Pell Grant and make access to the grant year round. He also said he wants to work on lowering the interest rates attached to student loans.</p>\n<p>“The interest rates … are really high, and I think we need to stop the profiteering by certain financial institutions on the backs of students trying to get a college education,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>Carbajal addressed the issue of immigration last, sharing that his father immigrated to the United States from Mexico back “when immigration worked.”</p>\n<p>He said the immigration system no longer works and needs comprehensive reform and the creation of a clear path to citizenship.</p>\n<p>Carbajal said it is challenging to introduce Democratic legislation in the current Congress because oftentimes Republicans block the legislation from moving forward to the floor.</p>\n<p>He said, however, that constituents still can influence policies when they vocalize their concerns, noting the way the Republicans failed to pass their alternative to the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>“I remind you that when you believe in these issues and sometimes feel a little powerless and you question whether your advocacy … works, look what happened with the Affordable Care Act,” he said. “That happened because people spoke up.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77072\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/its-a-long-haul-for-carbajal-as-a-minority-congressional-democrat/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77072\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/its-a-long-haul-for-carbajal-as-a-minority-congressional-democrat/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/its-a-long-haul-for-carbajal-as-a-minority-congressional-democrat/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/its-a-long-haul-for-carbajal-as-a-minority-congressional-democrat/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/its-a-long-haul-for-carbajal-as-a-minority-congressional-democrat/","id":2719,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2718,2717,2716],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
