For spring quarter, the team upgraded GauchoSpace’s capacity for connections to help the site function with heavy traffic, according to Gus Wood, instructional applications operational expert for GauchoSpace Development and Support.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“GauchoSpace wasn’t designed and set up for quite this environment right out the box, so we’ve kind of been looking at analytics of use and then applying changes to the system configuration as we go,” Wood said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a user has an issue with GauchoSpace, they can either submit a </span><a href=\"https://help.lsit.ucsb.edu/hc/en-us/requests/new\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ticket</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the support team explaining the issue or attend the Monday to Friday, 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. drop-in College of Letters and Science IT hours over Zoom. The team works remotely now, but Wood considered the transition “fairly seamless.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, Wood’s team spends “more time than usual” helping instructors — who’ve never used GauchoSpace in any significant capacity — navigate the platform and tailor their classes to an online curriculum. Wood added that his team needed to help many instructors set up and use the testing options on GauchoSpace. Not all instructors use GauchoSpace to conduct exams, but there have been disputes between university members and proctoring services, such as </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-16/ucsb-faculty-association-issues-letter-advising-against-the-use-of-proctoru-testing-services/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ProctorU</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, about privacy concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Testing administered through GauchoSpace is by far the biggest use of data on the platform, especially due to remote learning, according to Diane Soini, GauchoSpace’s learning management system programmer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you have 800 people and the quiz closes all at once for all of them, all of a sudden, several systems have to calculate everybody’s grade and submit all of their submissions,” Soini said. “It’s a pretty big hit to the system.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GauchoSpace Development and Support team can monitor exams with tight deadlines in real time in order to respond quickly to issues that could occur during the testing period, according to Soini.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wood manages seven graduate student instructional design assistants who help the website perform various tasks, with the bulk of their work spent helping professors and teaching assistants successfully utilize the platform. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With midterms in full swing, the challenge of adapting tests and quizzes to an online platform  while maintaining the tests’ rigor and difficulty level has kept the design assistants busy answering questions and concerns from instructors. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can provide advice on what question types to use, and depending on how instructors would prefer to grade their midterms, what settings to use and we address a lot of concerns about cheating,” Erica Johnson, an instructional design assistant, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although cheating remains an issue for some professors, Johnson said the opportunity to cheat is unlikely to disappear.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t say that there’s a way to completely prevent cheating and sharing of answers, but there are some measures that we can take in the online tools that we use to minimize that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson added that essay-style questions, randomizing the order of questions and answers and time limits are all effective tools for preventing cheating over GauchoSpace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another instructional design assistant, Jonathan Downey, added that the graduate students were generally working more hours now, with most of the graduate students working on average 20 hours a week </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">double the hours of last quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of grad students will be TAs and whatnot, this is kind of what I do in lieu of that,” Downey said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GauchoSpace, which was built on an open-source platform called Moodle, allows the support team to share tips with other universities about how they’ve learned to adapt GauchoSpace using Moodle under the new circumstances. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Utilising Moodle’s open-source software, programmers across different universities can share how they’ve solved bugs and shortened the time a support team needs to troubleshoot, according to Hector Gonzalez, GauchoSpace’s instructional applications programmer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While UCSB announced Tuesday that all </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/all-summer-sessions-to-be-conducted-remotely-university-announces/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">summer sessions </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">would be carried out through remote instruction, the fate of in-person classes for fall quarter remains uncertain. Until the university makes its decision, the GauchoSpace team will need to keep up its increased support level.  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re definitely going to need to maintain that elevated level of support,” Wood said. “I would say that’s what we’re anticipating.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94319\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/gauchospace-sees-increased-visits-new-challenges-amid-remote-instruction-transition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94319\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/gauchospace-sees-increased-visits-new-challenges-amid-remote-instruction-transition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/gauchospace-sees-increased-visits-new-challenges-amid-remote-instruction-transition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/gauchospace-sees-increased-visits-new-challenges-amid-remote-instruction-transition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/gauchospace-sees-increased-visits-new-challenges-amid-remote-instruction-transition/","id":1826,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[1825,1824,1823],"comments":[{"id":"ed41853a-c670-4b77-b404-4d428a2eb3a9","name":"Sample User 4","email":"mocknexus@gmail.com","parent":null,"content":"Proin diam magna, aliquam at justo in, pharetra blandit orci.

Senate’s unallocated budget, which is not designated for spending on a specific topic. The fund, provided by students through campus fees, will have $88,688.30 left after the transfer to the Financial Crisis Response Team (FCRT) and Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) offices, according to the resolution. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was really important that we use some of our excess student fees that the students have paid into A.S. in the first place,” Ferguson said. “This is their money and it deserves to be going towards things that will be helping them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FCRT, which helps students facing financial difficulties through a variety of services such as housing rent vouchers, will disperse the money among students who need it most based on the response team’s general review process, according to Rebecca Plotkin, the basic needs coordinator in the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships and a member of the FCRT.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EOP provides </span><a href=\"http://eop.sa.ucsb.edu/services/grant\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S./EOP</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> grants to students facing specific financial needs, such as medical costs, according to Aaron Jones, director of the EOP; he added that the EOP office currently has roughly $4,000 left for A.S./EOP grants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there is no set date for the organizations to receive the money, Ferguson said he expects A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez, who is directed by the resolution to transfer the funds, to do so “promptly.” After the FCRT and EOP distribute the funds, Marquez will write a report about how the money was spent and present it to the A.S.

So far, no one has broken any rules; they’re taking it seriously.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neumann said that he aimed to have the server as precise as possible, having users follow a 1-meter-per-block scale and directing them to use Google Earth for measurements. Members of the Discord server have been sending pictures of buildings for references as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first completed structure was UCSB’s signature Storke Tower, soon followed by Storke Plaza, the UCen and the Arbor, said Neumann; the University Library is also in progress. Once campus construction is finished, the project will expand to rebuilding Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neumann said his overall goal is to build the campus to such an accurate degree that when someone explores the completed server, it feels like the real deal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Neumann, the server has been experiencing technical issues due to heavy traffic on the hosting site. With this being his first time running a large server, Neumann has been doing his best to keep members updated on the server’s status, actively posting announcements on the Discord and Facebook groups. Once the technical issues are resolved, Neumann hopes to incorporate a survival portion to the world, which includes player-versus-player elements, and hold weekend events within the server. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later in the quarter, Neumann said he is looking forward to celebrating a Minecraft graduation with everyone in the community. But for now, the main focus has been constructing the campus in creative mode, a feature that allows users to build freely with access to all the materials within the game, in addition to just spending time indoors and following the state’s stay-at-home order. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93901\" style=\"width: 1093px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-04-08/ucsb-minecraft-server-building-a-home-away-from-home/library-5/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-93901\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93901\" data-attachment-id=\"93901\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-08/ucsb-minecraft-server-building-a-home-away-from-home/library-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?fit=1083%2C609&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1083,609\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"library\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-93901 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?resize=888%2C499\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?w=1083&amp;ssl=1 1083w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93901\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Charles Neumann</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thomas Montero, a third-year physics major and active member in the community, is responsible for starting the construction of the University Library and many other structures in the server.
