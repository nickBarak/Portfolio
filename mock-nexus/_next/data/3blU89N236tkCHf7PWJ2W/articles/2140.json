However, he is currently batting a meager .225, which may cause some owners to get nervous. This slump will not last. He is already starting to come out of it. He is a career .299 hitter and has not finished any season with worse than a .281 average. Over his last seven games he is hitting a respectable .261, and that average should continue to rise.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Carlos Lee, 1B, Houston Astros — .225 BA, 1 HR</strong></p>\n<p><em>Be Cautious</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Like Martinez, Lee (a career .287 hitter) has started of his 2011 campaign by carrying a .225 average into the first half of April. However, unlike Martinez, recovery is not certain in this case. Lee will be 35 next month and is in his 12th pro season (compared to Martinez’s 9th). His stats from last season show that his age might be starting to catch up with him, when he finished with a .246 average and fewer than 100 RBI for the first time since 2004. His home run totals have also been decreasing over the last five seasons. Fantasy owners drafted him hoping that last season was a fluke, but this slow start may indicate otherwise. Don’t count him out just yet, but it might be a good idea to feel out trades to see what value you can get for him.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Aaron Hill, 2B, Toronto Blue Jays — .186 BA, 0 HR</strong></p>\n<p><em>Panic</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hill followed up a fantastic 2009 campaign with a horrible 2010 season, during which he struggled to keep his average above .200 as fantasy owners hoped desperately for a return to his 2009 production in which he hit .286 with 36 homers and 108 RBI. He is currently hitting .186, with no homers through the first 10 games — a start all too similar to last year’s. Get rid of him if he doesn’t improve over the next couple weeks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Derek Jeter, SS, New York Yankees — .206 BA, .300 OBP, .235 SLG</strong></p>\n<p><em>Panic</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A future hall-of-famer, Jeter was once an unquestioned fantasy starter. Now it appears as if his 16 years of MLB service are finally taking their toll. He finished last season with his worst batting average since his rookie season, and tallied his lowest home run total since 2003. Through his first nine games this season he is hitting just .206 with no homers. While you should not drop him yet, you should keep him out of your lineup until he shows signs of recovery. At this point in his career, he’s more of a fantasy back up anyway.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Adrian Beltre, 3B, Texas Rangers — .205 BA, 3 HR</strong></p>\n<p><em>Don’t Panic</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Beltre was perhaps the most coveted free agent in baseball this offseason, and eventually signed with the Rangers. What he has given them in the early going, however, is not what they expected. While no one expected him to match last season’s production, they also did not expect him to start the season off by hitting .192 up to this point. Don’t panic yet however. His average won’t match last season’s, as he is a career .274 hitter and has only finished with an average above .300 in two seasons. His power, however, has not abandoned him. He has already hit three homers and plays in a very hitter-friendly park. Once his batting average corrects itself, he will be a solid player for the remainder of the season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Jacoby Ellsbury, OF, Boston Red Sox — .194 BA, .256 OBP, .389 SLG</strong></p>\n<p><em>Don’t Panic</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After missing the vast majority of last season to injury, Ellsbury came into this season looking to make up for lost time and to return to the form he had in 2009, when he stole 70 bags and hit .301. Right now he is hitting just .194, but that should correct itself. His slugging percentage is not that far from what it was is 2009, but his on base percentage is way down, which suggests he’s simply suffering from bad luck at the moment and that can’t last forever. Ellsbury is still a good source of steals, so stick with him.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>David Price, SP, Tampa Bay Rays — 4.85 ERA, 9 K, 2 walks</strong></p>\n<p><em>Be Cautious</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One of the best young pitchers in the league, Price is off to a lukewarm start in 2011. Over two starts, both losses, he has posted a 4.85 ERA and just nine strikeouts. Despite the numbers, there is no cause for concern at this point. He has issued just two walks so far, so his command is not the issue. But while his numbers might improve, wins might be hard to come by when he is backed by an anemic offense.

To put it simply: scarcity. It’s easier to find starting-quality batters later in the draft than it is to find starting-quality pitching because the MLB contains more elite hitters than pitchers. For example, in this year’s draft, I spent my first three picks on pitchers, namely Josh Johnson of the Marlins, Jon Lester of the Red Sox, and Roy Halladay of the Phillies. What separates pitchers like these from others is that they can help your team in every pitching category while simultaneously posing no risk.</p>\n<p>The next pitcher I took in the draft was Edinson Volquez of the Reds. While not a bad pitcher — he’s a lock for a significant amount of strikeouts — Volquez poses a threat to my team ERA and WHIP every time he takes the mound because of his notorious lack of control. I didn’t take Volquez late in the draft, either; that pick came just a few rounds after I picked up Johnson.</p>\n<p>Pitching talent drops off quickly. Not every MLB team has a legitimate ace on their team, and very few have more than one. That means that if you are playing in a 12-team league like I am, it is possible for all the most reliable pitching to be gone within the first three rounds.</p>\n<p>The same cannot be for hitters. For an MLB team to be successful, they have to assemble a hitting lineup devoid of glaring weak spots. Normally everyone has a few holes, but that means that each team is still contributing about six quality hitters to the world of fantasy sports. Because of this, owners can still pick up players like the Cardinals third-baseman David Freese in the 19th round.</p>\n<p>While Freese’s name does not carry the value of other players like the Rays’ third baseman Evan Longoria, he can still be counted on to provide a batting average of at least .285, around 20 home runs, and upwards of 80 RBI. Those are starting-quality numbers, and he is only my backup. The first pitcher to be taken in the same round in my draft is nationals starting pitcher Jordan Zimmermann, who has been projected to accumulate a grand total of eight wins this season with an ERA close to four. And when I was picking Rangers first baseman Mitch Moreland — who is expected to put up numbers similar to Freese’s — to be my backup at that position, another member of my league was picking Erik Bedard of the Mariners, expected to do even worse than Zimmermann, to be one of his starters at the pitching position.</p>\n<p>The argument could be made that great hitting would offset mediocre hitting. That could be true. I could find later in the season that I made a terrible mistake. Although I did not pick any batters that could hurt me in a scoring category, I also did not pick any that are projected to put up elite numbers. None of my players are projected to finish with a batting average over .299, and none of them are expected to hit more than 29 home runs. But right now, with the season so young, all I have to work with are projections and predictions.</p>\n<p>When my draft was over, ESPN predicted that my team would win my league. I can only attribute this to my strategy in the draft. I stockpiled great pitching early because I knew that I could get the hitting I needed later in the draft. But I also didn’t forget to get useful hitters. It’s all about knowing how to properly assign value, and if something is scarce, like quality pitching, it is more valuable, and you always go after that which is most valuable first.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-35525\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/green-advice-baseball-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-35525\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/green-advice-baseball-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/green-advice-baseball-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/green-advice-baseball-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/green-advice-baseball-season/","id":2137,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2136,2135,2134],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
