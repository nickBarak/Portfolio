Senior forward Matt Wiesenfarth played the hero in that game, scoring his fourth goal of the season on a breakaway in the 93rd minute.</p>\n<p>In UCSB and UC Davis’ two meetings this season, the Gauchos came away victorious thanks to three goals from sophomore holding midfielder Kevin Feucht, all of which came from the penalty spot.</p>\n<p>“The fact that we’ve gotten three goals from the spot means that we’re doing some damage in the box,” Selemani said. “Obviously you want to get goals in other fashions, but I think the fact that we’re getting goals is important and the fact we’re getting wins is all that matters right now.”</p>\n<p>In the two teams’ first meeting at Harder Stadium, the Gauchos lost a 1-0 lead after conceding a 74th minute goal to junior Steven Guzman. It was a trademark goal for Davis that was characteristic of the gameplan it has continued to utilize against UCSB, being scored by a defender following a scramble off a long throw into the box.</p>\n<p>“We have to have high pressure and keep them from scoring set piece goals because that’s where they’re most dangerous,” junior left back Ismaila Jome said. “Their two center backs have their most goals, so if we just keep them from getting any headers in the box and play as well as we have throughout the season we’ll be fine.”</p>\n<p>However, junior forward Nick DePuy was dragged down in the box just 50 seconds after the Aggies’ equalizer, leading to Feucht’s second penalty of the game and eventual game-winner.</p>\n<p>Davis brings to town a physical, sluggish style that serves as somewhat of a foil to UCSB’s more traditional approach of passing and making good runs into the box. The Gauchos ended the season with the eighth best offense in the nation, scoring 38 goals through 19 games.</p>\n<p>“They have two guys, [sophomore forward Evan Barrett and junior forward Dashiell MacNamara], who are pretty quick,” Selemani said. “We just need to make sure we take those guys down and we have a good chance to win again.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies’ offensive attack can be summed up by the fact that its top two goal scorers during the regular season were defenders in senior Lucas Mohageg and redshirt freshman Roy Boateng. They will be looking to keep the score low as they wait for their chance to pack the box and find a goal off a good ball in or a fortunate bounce.</p>\n<p>“We work on [clearing] every practice, but especially [this week],” Selemani said. “We had everybody setting up in [Davis’] formations and defended like we would tomorrow, so hopefully that works as well and we get the result.”</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos have had great success during conference play in recent years, they have been unable to get it done when it matters most, going 0-3 over the past two postseasons. That will likely change this time around with an experienced core group that has grown together over the years.</p>\n<p>“Since I’ve been here this is the best team as far as talent-wise, just collectively,” Jome said. “We have a good mix of younger guys and older guys and we know how big of a struggle it is to get into the postseason and win games.”</p>\n<p>Under Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg, who received a record fifth conference Coach of the Year Award, UCSB’s dominant record this season was reflected in its dominance of the Big West yearly awards.</p>\n<p>Nick DePuy earned his second consecutive Big West Offensive Player of the Year after scoring 15 goals through 19 games. To put that number in perspective, the four players who tied for second in goals in the conference had less than half of DePuy’s total with seven. Only one NCAA player, USC Upstate’s Gordon Wild (16), has scored more goals than him this year.</p>\n<p>The 6-4 DePuy has been unstoppable all season thanks to a combination of size, good feet, extremely accurate shooting, and an excellent supporting cast that has given him great service. All of these factors have helped catapult him to a nation-leading eight game-winning goals. His individual success has led to the team’s success ever since he switched from the midfield to forward midway through last season, proven by UCSB’s undefeated record of 16-0-4 in games he has scored in.</p>\n<p>DePuy’s aforementioned supporting cast includes Big West Freshman of the Year Geoffrey Acheampong, who scored four goals and led the Big West with 10 assists, good for sixth-best in the country. UCSB first-year players have now won the award in four consecutive seasons and six of the past seven.</p>\n<p>The former Cate School star received a Big West Honorable Mention alongside sophomore left back Randy Mendoza and freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg.</p>\n<p>Other players joining DePuy on the All-Big West First Team were Feucht, who was second on the team with five goals, junior midfielder Josue Espana, and senior defender Duncan Backus.</p>\n<p>Selemani rounds out the long list of Gauchos receiving accolades, being named All-Big West Second Team with four goals. He ranked third in the conference with 50 shots, putting a high amount of pressure on back lines all year to help free up space for his teammates.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will benefit from having 11 nights of rest since their last game against Davis on Halloween, thanks to their winning the No. 1 seed and a bye in the first round of the postseason. In that final regular season game against the Aggies, UCSB came away with a 1-0 victory after freshman forward Cody Gibson was taken down in the box, leading to another game-winning penalty by Feucht.</p>\n<p>The winner of Wednesday’s game will face the winner between Cal Poly and Cal State Fullerton on Saturday. If the Gauchos win, they will be at home for the championship game as they look to win their first Big West title since 2010.</p>\n<p>“Tomorrow is the biggest test because we haven’t made it to the final in [four] years,” Jome said. “The biggest challenge would just be winning tomorrow, and after that, we have to take it game by game.”</p>\n<p>Tomorrow’s game begins at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66324\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/big-west-tournament-semis-time-to-shine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66324\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/big-west-tournament-semis-time-to-shine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/big-west-tournament-semis-time-to-shine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/big-west-tournament-semis-time-to-shine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-10/big-west-tournament-semis-time-to-shine/","id":1464,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1463,1462,1461],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson","biography":"Not available","articles":[121,137,246,247,249,250,342,355,358,359,360,377,378,380,384,386,390,394,397,399,400,404,405,413,415,417,418,421,428,432,435,436,438,443,445,459,460,462,463,464,466,469,475,477,480,482,483,486,495,497,498,499,500,501,505,545,599,843,967,968,971,982,984,985,986,987,988,989,990,991,992,993,994,995,1016,1017,1019,1020,1021,1023,1024,1025,1107,1147,1173,1198,1400,1462,1463,1464,1469,1470,1471,1472,1474,1476,1477,1478,1481,1482,1483,1485,1486,1487,1495,1498,1501,1502,1504,1507,1508,1509,1510,1511,1514,1516,1517,1519,1521,1523,1525,1533,1534,1535,1536,1537,1538,1543,1544,1545,1546,1547,1548,1551,1552,1553,1556,1557,1559,1985,1994,1999,2028,2033,2039,2066,3210,3219,3230,3241,3258,3285,3289,3291,3295,5051,5065,5067,5078,5083,5084,5086,5087,5090,5091,5092,5093,5094,5095,5096,5099,5100,5243,5262,5276,5277,5278,5279,5280,5281,5282,5283,5284,5285,5286,5288,5293,5305,5306,5308,5309,5312,5313],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Head into Postseason with No. 2 Seed","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.10.23_StephenManga_WSoccer-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.10.23_StephenManga_WSoccer-9-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"For the first time since 2009, the UCSB women's soccer team will compete in the Big West Tournament.

Each team concluded its conference schedule with a 6-2 record and a total 18 points.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos are coming off a demanding week in which they played in two senior night matches against Fullerton and Cal State Northridge. After pulling off the upset Thursday night against the Titans, the Matadors made sure to spoil Santa Barbara’s five-game winning streak with a 4-3 overtime win off a penalty kick from junior midfielder Kourtney Kutscher.</p>\n<p>Despite ending conference play on a bitter note, Head Coach Paul Stumpf believes the tough loss has helped prepare UCSB for its postseason matchup.</p>\n<p>“It’s good to know the team’s characters are intact [from this loss], they will fight to the end and they can score three goals in eleven minutes if the conditions are right. There definitely were some good lessons to take from [this weekend],” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Despite a one-game skid, the Gauchos have finished their season strong, winning seven of their last nine matches. Helping guide his team to its third regular season title with an overall record of 13-5-1, Stumpf claimed his second Big West Coach of the Year Award.<br>\nStumpf’s coaching and ability to pull out late-game victories has paid dividends for the team as UCSB will see its first Big West Tournament appearance since 2009. Santa Barbara is 3-3-3 overall in the conference tournament, having its previous postseason match against Cal Poly end in a 1-1 tie.</p>\n<p>UCSB is welcomed back to the tournament with the tough task of trying to contain the 2015-16 Big West Offensive Player of the year in Fullerton’s Rebecca Wilson. The redshirt senior forward has carried her team all season long, scoring 18 goals on the year, the most of any Big West player this season.</p>\n<p>Wilson led Fullerton past Cal Poly on the road last Sunday, recording both of the team’s goals in a 2-1 win. The senior has compiled 77 starts in her four years at CSFU, including five game-winning goals, tied for the sixth most in Titans’ history.</p>\n<p>In preparation of Fullerton’s high-powered offense, the Gauchos will depend on the forward duo of freshman Mallory Hromatko and sophomore Amanda Ball to lead their offensive attack. The two forwards were huge pieces in Santa Barbara’s match against Fullerton and CSUN. Hromatko assisted Ball on the game-winning goal against CSFU while Ball also scored the 3-3 equalizer to send UCSB into overtime against the Matadors.</p>\n<p>The two underclassmen have made their mark this year, combining for a total of 13 goals, eight assists and 36 points. The two landed Big West honors this past Tuesday with Hromatko being named to the First Team All-Big West and Ball to the Second Team.</p>\n<p>However, Hromatko and Ball have not been the only sources of production in the Gauchos’ success. Stumpf accredits his young group along with the leadership of upperclassmen’s supporting the team’s ability to compete at a high level.</p>\n<p>“[This team] has surprised us in how savvy they are tactically,” Stumpf said. “We can make an adjustment at half and with no practice time they are able to implement them into the game … I guess I have a little more confidence in this young team because they have just found ways to win.”</p>\n<p>The mixture of youth and experience has been a vital element in the Gauchos’ progression to the postseason. Along with Hromatko and Ball, six total players were selected to an All-Big West Team including freshman Jessica Parque, freshman Sydney Magnin, sophomore midfielder Chace Schornstein and junior defender Sydney Fuertes.</p>\n<p>“We owe a lot of our success to the older players because if they weren’t so welcoming to us freshmen, I don’t think our chemistry would be the same as it is right now,” Hromatko said. “It’s a group effort every time we step out on the field and the individual stats are not even a factor.”</p>\n<p>The keys to victory are simple for UCSB this Thursday: polish the team fundamentals they have been working on all season, and build from the positives of last week’s win against Fullerton.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we have to change [our] play at all against [Fullerton], we just have to continue what we have been doing,” Hromatko said. “We need to build off our play in the second half against them because we were able to connect more once we realized how their formations worked.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will open up its first Big West Tournament match at Titan Stadium Thursday night. Kickoff against Fullerton will commence at 7:30 p.m. While this is yet another challenge for this young team, they understand the importance of embracing the moment and not letting it slip away from them.</p>\n<p>“Our goal [this year] was to make it to the Big West Tournament,” Hromatko said. “So now it’s just about leaving everything you have out on the field because you never know when it could be our last game … we are going to come out strong Thursday and play for each other like we have been all season long.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of November 5, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

They will need a win against Cal Poly and a UC Davis loss on Saturday to secure the final spot in the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>The seats at Harder Stadium weren’t even warm yet before DePuy got his team on the board less than two minutes into the game. After UCSB won a free kick deep in the left midfield, freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong played a long ball towards senior defender Duncan Backus at the far post.</p>\n<p>Despite a difficult angle, Backus redirected a header back across goal right where DePuy was making his run, and he knocked it in to open the scoring. The goal was the fastest scored for UCSB all season, coming just 104 seconds into the game and marking the second straight game in which DePuy has scored.</p>\n<p>The two sides provided little action until the second half, when DePuy capped off his night recording his third brace of the year. In the 53rd minute, freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong played a simple cross in from the right side towards DePuy, who rose above his defender and headed it down and in towards the far post as he has done so many times this season.</p>\n<p>“We wanted the second goal because this is a dangerous team,” Vom Steeg said. “They score a lot on free kicks, they break out really well, and they haven’t been shutout in a while, so my concern was I didn’t think one goal was going to be enough.”</p>\n<p>UCSB went up 2-0 for the second straight game, but it took just 17 seconds for the Hornets to answer back and cut the lead in half. A cross from the left wing by junior midfielder Ivan Ramirez cut through the Santa Barbara defense before senior forward Isaac Flores put away his fourth goal of the season.</p>\n<p>However, unlike when they tied Cal Poly 2-2 last Saturday, the Gauchos were able to hold on to extend their unbeaten streak to three games.</p>\n<p>“Credit to the team, we did finish this game off a little better than [against Cal Poly],” Vom Steeg said. “We took a couple balls to the corner, we made it a throw in game, we won the head balls in the box that we had to win. All those things that we did not do against Cal Poly, we did tonight.”</p>\n<p>The Big West has seen quite a few goals from the Gauchos this season, who lead the conference with 37 total, but the offensive success can be attributed mostly to DePuy, who ranks first in the nation with 15 goals and eight game-winners.</p>\n<p>“The one thing we discussed at the beginning of the season was if he wanted to pick up 15, 16 goals, he would have to work really hard in the offseason on attacking the ball and either putting it back across the box or getting it down,” Vom Steeg said. “He put the work in to be where he is right now. It’s very hard to stop him when he gets the kind of service he got today.”</p>\n<p>Picking up an assist on both of UCSB’s goals, Acheampong now has 10 for the year, three more than anyone else in the conference.</p>\n<p>“Today I think it all kind of came together,” Acheampong said. “The big guys have been open all year. It just comes down to how efficiently I can get it done and how well I’m able to find them.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos lost junior winger Ismaila Jome to injury in the first half and he did not return. Jome recently returned to the lineup after missing nearly half the season with an ankle injury.</p>\n<p>With Cal Poly drawing 0-0 against UC Davis last night, both the UCSB men’s and women’s soccer teams clinched a spot in the Big West Tournament for the first time since 2009. The Gauchos can keep the No. 1 seed, a first round bye and home-field advantage in the tournament for the third-straight year with a win or tie on Saturday or a Cal Poly loss or tie.</p>\n<p>UCSB will close out the regular season at UC Davis on Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65947\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/no-18-ucsb-defeats-sac-st-behind-more-depuy-magic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65947\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/no-18-ucsb-defeats-sac-st-behind-more-depuy-magic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/no-18-ucsb-defeats-sac-st-behind-more-depuy-magic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/no-18-ucsb-defeats-sac-st-behind-more-depuy-magic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-29/no-18-ucsb-defeats-sac-st-behind-more-depuy-magic/","id":1462,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1461,1460,1459],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Late Goal Springs No. 17 UCSB to Big West Final","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_Soccer_UCD_111115_Eric_Swenson_006-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_Soccer_UCD_111115_Eric_Swenson_006-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"After defeating UC Davis for the third time in 2015, the Gauchos will play in their first Big West Tournament Championship since 2011 this Saturday against Cal State Fullerton.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_66388\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_Soccer_UCD_111115_Eric_Swenson_006-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"603435463\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66391\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66388\" data-attachment-id=\"66388\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/mens_soccer_ucd_111115_eric_swenson_006-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_Soccer_UCD_111115_Eric_Swenson_006-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"Ahinga Selemani crosses the ball in for an unsuccessful attempt on goal.

Eric Swenson/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>For the first time in four years, the No. 17 UCSB men’s soccer team will be playing for the Big West Tournament Championship. After being deadlocked with UC Davis through 78 minutes in the semifinal match on Wednesday, sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani unleashed a perfectly placed near-post strike from just outside the box to spring the Gauchos to a 1-0 victory.</p>\n<p>“Tonight was a tough game. Anytime you play a team that if they lose their season’s over, you’re going to get everything they have,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We played well tonight. We moved the ball around well, we had our best game in terms of possession, our backs did well in trying to control the game, and we took what they gave us.”</p>\n<p>With the win, Santa Barbara ends a streak of four consecutive postseason losses dating back to 2011 and improves to a record of 13-5-2 overall and 8-2-1 against Big West opponents.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After going winless in their final five regular season games, the Aggies defeated CSUN 2-1 in the quarterfinals to advance and have a chance to avenge two losses to the Gauchos in the previous three weeks. However, UCSB completed a perfect 3-0 sweep of Davis in 2015, dropping the Aggies to 8-10-3 overall, 3-5-3 conference.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will now host Cal State Fullerton in the Big West Tournament finals this Saturday. The Titans overcame an early 1-0 deficit against Cal Poly last night to take a 3-1 win at home, thanks to a second half brace by sophomore midfielder Diego Sanchez.</p>\n<p>Fullerton enters the championship game this Saturday as the No. 1 seed in the Big West South, boasting a record of 12-7-1 overall, 7-3-1 conference.</p>\n<p>After having 11 days off since their last regular season game, the Gauchos came out rested and healthy on Wednesday night. The game marked the third consecutive year that UCSB has entered the semifinals with home-field advantage and the No. 1 seed, but in the past the Gauchos have not been able to get the job done despite playing at home, going 0-3 in the postseason since 2013.</p>\n<p>That all changed last night thanks to a timely one-two between Selemani and sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht, who was placed in a more attacking role than he has been for most of the season. After receiving the ball back on the give and go, Selemani fired a shocking shot in from 25 yards out to give UCSB its only goal against Davis all season that didn’t come from the penalty spot.</p>\n<p>“It feels good to finally bring a playoff win at home,” senior defender Duncan Backus said. “We’ve had so many letdowns in front of our fans, but to finally get into that Big West final it’s a new experience for all of us and it’s a really good opportunity to make some noise and get into the NCAA Tournament.”</p>\n<p>It was the fourth goal for Selemani all season, justifying his All-Big West Second Team selection in his first year with UCSB.</p>\n<p>“My goal was basically to get as many chances as I could,” Selemani said. “I was fortunate enough to get a ball from Kevin in the second half. It’s a strength of mine to put the ball on my left foot and I was lucky enough to get it past the keeper.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara gained control of the game about 15 minutes in. Dominating possession for the rest of the first half and finding several good scoring chances. Junior Ismaila Jome, who has missed significant time this season with an ankle injury, was dangerous nearly every time he touched the ball, torching defenders and sending balls in from the left wing. However, Davis was able to keep the game scoreless all the way until the break.</p>\n<p>“I had the luxury tonight of this being the first time that I can remember going into the Big West Tournament with a full complement of players,” Vom Steeg said. “[Davis] got tired, we were able to press them a little bit, we needed one good shot and Ahinga got that for us tonight.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies picked up the pressure in the second half, attacking UCSB hard on the counter. They found their best chance to score in the 54th minute, when a header by freshman forward Kristian Heptner forced freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg to make an outstanding one-handed, diving save just inside the post.</p>\n<p>It was a relatively quiet night for Vom Steeg, but his two saves in the game helped give UCSB its second consecutive 1-0 victory, both of which came against Davis.</p>\n<p>“I thought it was a great game. It was entertaining,” Davis Head Coach Dwayne Shaffer said. “I give all the credit to Santa Barbara, that’s probably the best team I’ve seen in Santa Barbara in five years. I was impressed.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will now shift its focus to Saturday’s game, when it will play a Fullerton team that it took two overtimes to defeat at home just over a month ago.</p>\n<p>The Big West Tournament Championship will be played Saturday night at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of November 12, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66391\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66391\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/","id":1463,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1462,1461,1460],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
