She formed a tight circle of friends while she was at UCSB, infecting acquaintances with her positivity and open mindedness.</p>\n<p>“She was always smiling,” Rod Gomez, a fourth-year environmental science major who met Lim when they were second-year students, said.</p>\n<p>While juggling a full course load in the engineering department, Lim managed a job at Curvature, paid her own bills and was always open to adventure. At Curvature, coworkers were impressed by her work ethic, and Lim had plans to continue working in Santa Barbara after graduating in June.</p>\n<p>Lim loved melodic dubstep beats and electronic dance music, especially the producer Seven Lions. She tried her hand at DJing for fun, friends said, and she was an avid supporter of her friend’s musical pursuits.</p>\n<p>Raghav Thirumulu, Lim’s housemate and close friend, said she had an impressive talent for video games, beating her friends at games she had just picked up. She also entertained an obsession with several television shows, including “Westworld,” “Black Mirror” and “The Walking Dead.”</p>\n<p>“She just gave off this energy that made your day so much easier,” Ming Guo, who also lived with Lim, said.</p>\n<p>Evelyn Choi met Lim during her first year, and soon considered her a best friend and a sister. The first night they met in Anacapa Residence Hall, the two fell asleep while talking and studying in the lounge. A custodial worker woke them up several hours later, and “From then on, I knew she was going to be someone really important in my life,” Choi said.</p>\n<p>Over four years, Choi became accustomed to Lim’s quirks — including her keen interest in World War II. Lim had posters of “Band of Brothers” and “The Pacific” throughout her room, and she considered the era one of the rawest moments in human emotion.</p>\n<p>Lim was also given a few goofy nicknames: “Chrispitos,” named after crispy taquitos, and “Christinith,” referencing the movie “The Other Guys.”</p>\n<p>Landon Peik, a fourth-year mechanical engineering major, met Lim for the first time at Hard Summer music festival. He remembers Choi leaning on Lim’s shoulder for the duration of a set by Porter Robinson, enjoying her friends’ company with their favorite music.</p>\n<p>College was a transformational time for Lim, her friends said, and she was always happy to go on hiking trips, to music festivals and spend time with people. She made her friends feel comfortable, while always challenging them with new ideas.</p>\n<p>Armando Muñoz, one of Lim’s housemates, described her as “one of the guys.”</p>\n<p>“You could talk to her about anything, at any time,” he said. “She was always down to listen and give advice. She could take it and dish it better than most guys.”</p>\n<p>Lim was extremely humble about her intelligence through years of hard work, friends said, and she never complained, even on her first 13-mile hike through the Sequoia Woods.</p>\n<p>Chris Tuch, a UCSB alumnus, met Lim as a resident assistant in Anacapa Residence Hall. The two were close, often staying up for hours watching Netflix shows, talking and playing Nintendo 64 games.<br>\n“She was a homie,” he said.</p>\n<p>The group of friends this week received an outpouring of support from neighbors, friends and students who crossed paths with Lim. Thirumulu created a donation page Monday in her honor which quickly exceeded the target goal of $5,000, raising over $8,139 in two days.</p>\n<p>Friends will hold a memorial in Lim’s honor this weekend, playing her favorite music to celebrate her life. Anyone who is interested in attending can contact Thirumulu at<em> rrthirumulu@gmail.com</em>. Lim’s family will also arrange a funeral ceremony later this month.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, Feb. 9, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

Attendance during the following two years was “dramatically lower.”<em> Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The advertisements will appear on Pandora, Facebook and television in the weeks leading up to Deltopia, which typically takes place on the first weekend after spring break.</p>\n<p>According to Chuck Haines, the acting assistant chancellor for the Office of Budget and Planning, the funding for these advertisements comes from unrestricted gift funds, which are donations made by alumni.</p>\n<p>He said the university spent $41,000 in advertising for Deltopia and $30,000 for Halloween last year. According to Haines, UCSB typically runs these campaigns for three to four weeks, spending $10,000 per week of advertising.</p>\n<p>Students throughout California have reported hearing Pandora ads dissuading them from travelling to Santa Barbara for festivities held on both Deltopia and Halloween weekends.</p>\n<p>Alongside the Deltopia ad campaign, the university also contributes $15,000 per year to the much larger countywide “Keep Isla Vista Safe” campaign that runs television and radio advertisements year-round.</p>\n<p>According to university spokesperson Andrea Estrada, UCSB shares the cost of “Keep Isla Vista Safe” with local agencies including the City of Goleta, the Santa Barbara County District Attorney, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff and Santa Barbara City College.</p>\n<p>Two years ago, campaign organizers posted a video on their Facebook page warning viewers that attending Deltopia could potentially result in mugshots.</p>\n<p>The video also cautions viewers of the 300-officer police force, extra DUI checkpoints and severe parking restrictions. The hashtags #LocalsOnlyBrah and #StillPayingForIt were widely circulated on the page in preparation for last year’s Deltopia.</p>\n<p>The Nexus reported in April that students spoke out against “Keep Isla Vista Safe,” saying that the campaign received no input from students and inaccurately portrayed Isla Vista. The UCSB Task Force Against Police Brutality and the Black Student Union also held silent demonstrations at the Arbor.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Office of Student Affairs also sends letters to local high school and middle school principals discouraging young Isla Vistans from attending party weekends.</p>\n<p>The office sends a similar letter to college students in California detailing potential risks that Deltopia poses, such as severe parking restrictions, police presence and increased law and ordinance enforcement. Debbie Fleming, the assistant vice chancellor of student affairs, oversees the letters.</p>\n<p>“This letter goes to my counterpart at all the other UC campuses, and we ask for it to be distributed to students,” Fleming said. “We have a list of other California colleges that includes schools from which students have been arrested or cited in Isla Vista during past years.”</p>\n<p>The Office of Student Affairs additionally sends UCSB students emails with safety information prior to events such as Halloween and Deltopia that emphasize the university’s policy on visitors. Residence halls do not permit students to have guests during that timeframe. The university also runs ads in the <em>Nexus</em> and <em>The Bottom Line.</em></p>\n<p>The EVPLA office, which participates in the “Keep Isla Vista Local” campaign, sent postcards to each address in I.V. prior to Halloween weekend, in addition to communicating safety information before both Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p>Deltopia 2015 and 2016 witnessed a significant decrease in attendance paired with a drop in the number of arrests and citations.</p>\n<p>In a statement released on the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office Facebook page, authorities reported that last year’s turnout of 3,500 people was “dramatically lower” than the 10,000 people who were estimated to have attended in 2015 and the 20,000 to 25,000 people who attended in 2014.</p>\n<p>A.S. Program Board also holds a spring concert restricted only to UCSB students, which prevents visitors from attending.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had a lot of really positive feedback from students who like having a fun alternative that is for UCSB students only,” Fleming said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Feb. 9, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

will be there as a resource for them on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steven Kwok, a member of the Elections Committee, posed a series of questions, some created by the committee and others asked anonymously by audience members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some highlights: </span></p>\n<p><b>ON THE OFFICE: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tannenbaum said one of his “prime concerns” was creating more awareness of the Office of the Student Advocate General, since currently only about 20 students use the office per quarter. He plans to try to increase use of the office by encouraging resident assistants (RA) to give incoming freshmen information about the office’s resources. He said he plans to put an “extremely high” emphasis on promoting the office.</span></p>\n<p><b>PRESSING ISSUES: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tannenbaum said he believes the election of President Donald Trump has made many students, particularly undocumented students, feel unsafe on campus. Another large issue is bringing controversial speakers to campus, and as Student Advocate General, Tannenbaum said he hopes to make sure students’ opinions are heard and that everyone feels safe. He also noted the rising costs of tuition and cliff erosion as big concerns for students. </span></p>\n<p><b>ON BEING IMPARTIAL: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Non-partisanship is extremely important,” Tannenbaum said. He said he takes his status as a non-partisan independent seriously, having sought the endorsement of both Campus Republicans and Democrats to show he is committed to representing all students, regardless of their views.</span></p>\n<p><b>ON INSTITUTIONAL RACISM:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Tannenbaum said institutional racism is “one of the biggest issues in our country.” He said that as a white man, he has not experienced such racism but believes he can use his position to amplify the voices of those who do not feel heard on campus. Tannenbaum said he will try to make as many spaces safe on campus as possible and will do his best to make sure people’s voices are heard. </span></p>\n<p><b>ON PERSONAL IMPROVEMENT:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “I don’t sleep enough,” Tannenbaum said. “I push myself to work very hard and that often goes late into the night.” He said self care will be very important for him to do his best as Student Advocate General. </span></p>\n<p><b>ON EMOTIONAL LABOR: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tannenbaum said he had not heard the term “emotional labor” in an “official context” but believes it is the “effort and emotion put into one’s work.” He said A.S. sometimes ignores the effort and time students put into the issues they are invested in on campus. He said, if elected, he will strive to work to make sure A.S. understands how much students care about critical issues on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tannenbaum also fielded more lighthearted questions, revealing that his favorite board game is Diplomacy, a game that requires negotiation among players. He said he hopes to take the passion he has for the game to be as passionate about his work as Student Advocate General.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tannenbaum closed the forum by reiterating that he wants students to feel “heard, safe and represented,” something he feels is oftentimes overlooked within the community and student government. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tannenbaum, describing himself as “a pretty loud guy,” said he will do his best to make sure everyone is heard and that there are resources available for students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Please know that I care about the students on this campus, and I really strive to make this a home for everybody,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campaigning for A.S. elections began on Sunday and will continue for the next two weeks until voting results are announced on the night of April 27.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profiles of all 51 A.S. candidates can be found </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2017/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

While the two DJs often play music from foreign countries, this Tuesday’s show focused on Muslim rappers in particular.</p>\n<p>KCSB FM is the “perfect platform” for a show dedicated to resistance through the arts, Horne said.</p>\n<p>“Our whole ethos as a station is community radio representing sounds, music, opinions and values that you are not going to hear on commercial radio or in any other forms of media today,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Horne, hip-hop has been a symbol of dissent, revolution and change, as well as subverting what is expected from communities that have been brutalized by the dominant cultures.</p>\n<p>The two KCSB DJs chose music that tackles political unrest.</p>\n<p>The “Fire + Ice” hosts featured Libyan rapper Volcano’s single “Sawt Al Shaab,” and said his music video depicts the rapper singing in front of firing tanks while wearing golden chains and camouflage-patterned, oversized hoodies.</p>\n<p>Horne and Bernick, who goes by “DJ LenaBanga,” said “gangster imagery” is co-opted in the music video, modeled after the Western hip-hop scene.</p>\n<p>The DJs said the use of camouflage in the music video takes on a new meaning when placed in the context of a Middle East war zone.</p>\n<p>“The video, he shot it in a war zone in Benghazi. What’s really interesting going on in this video is a co-opting of gangster rap imagery. So, Volcano, he’s decked out in oversized hoodies, baggy camo pants, got the guns blaring, chain heavy,” Horne said.</p>\n<p>“The camo and the guns take on another meaning, but … we can apply that back to the origins of gangster rap here in the U.S. in the war zones that exist within our own cities,” he said.</p>\n<p>“He’s in a war zone, and these things are also very real,” Bernick said.</p>\n<p>Tuesday’s radio show primarily played songs in foreign languages, such as Arabic and Farsi.</p>\n<p>The DJs chose Tuesday night’s artists because they have considerable followings in the countries they come from, though they recognize that certain regions lack large hip-hop fan bases.</p>\n<p>“Iran has a pretty large hip-hop scene compared to some places like Yemen or Libya,” Horne said.</p>\n<p>Bernick and Horne also said the artists’ skepticism toward government was similar to the duo’s own.</p>\n<p>“We think a healthy dose of criticism and skepticism towards the state is really, really necessary for us to keep going with a sense of freedom that resembles what we know it to be,” Horne said.</p>\n<p>DJ Frank Discussion and DJ LenaBanga’s show can be heard on KCSB FM 91.9, or streamed live on <em>live.kcsb.org</em>, on Tuesday nights from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, February 2, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75408\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/kcsb-djs-spin-music-from-banned-countries/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75408\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/kcsb-djs-spin-music-from-banned-countries/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/kcsb-djs-spin-music-from-banned-countries/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/kcsb-djs-spin-music-from-banned-countries/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/kcsb-djs-spin-music-from-banned-countries/","id":2430,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2429,2428,2427],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
