F&amp;B met in the State Street room of the UCen on campus to consider $16,851 in requests from campus clubs. The committee fully funded requests from the Mock Trial Team for $1,495, Cotillion Dance Club for $3,950 and La Escuelita for $900. A.S. F&amp;B also partially funded requests from three clubs, allocating $2,370 to the Swing and Ballroom Dance Club, $3,000 to the Women’s Soccer Club and $850 to the Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA).</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the meeting, the committee operated with $19,500 in Office of Student Life (OSL) funds, $6,665 in Senate Unallocated funds, $45,000 Student Initiated Outreach Program funds, $28,565 in Culture Weeks and Graduations funds, $26,480 for sports teams and $17,164 for academic teams.</p>\n<p>The Swing and Ballroom Dance Club requested $3,006 to host their “Swingin’ Hearts Swing Dance” event on Feb. 13, and was granted $2,370 by the committee and told to request funding for parking passes and photo booths from After Dark, a club that funds student-run, alcohol-free events.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year film and media studies major and Swing and Ballroom Dance Club representative Cecilia Gutierrez said the club provides a fun and educational experience for all skill-levels.</p>\n<p>“We are committed to providing social events for dancing. We encourage dancers from all backgrounds to participate and create a community,” Gutierrez said.</p>\n<p>Women’s Club Soccer requested $6,000 to fund travel and coaching expenses for nationals in Arizona, and was granted $3,000, the maximum funding amount allowed for sports clubs.</p>\n<p>The Mock Trial Team requested and was awarded $1,495 for travel expenses and registration fees for competitions in Arizona, Fresno and San Diego.</p>\n<p>Mock Trial member and third-year undeclared major James McFeely said members of the club compete in events that simulate courts of law.</p>\n<p>“We like to see Mock Trial as an academic sport,” McFeely said. “We’re asking for money to bring as many teams and as many people to as many tournaments we can so we can teach them the best we can.”</p>\n<p>CSSA was awarded $850 of their $1,500 request for hosting a Casino Night with live student performers.</p>\n<p>CSSA representative and second-year economics major Peilin Hu said the event allows audience members to enjoy free music and mingle.</p>\n<p>“The event aims to provide a relaxed music environment where like-minded people can perform and the audience can enjoy music,” Hu said.</p>\n<p>Cotillion Dance Club requested and was awarded $3,950 to host a weekly dance event in the Hub, where students will receive free dance lessons and socialize with other dancers.</p>\n<p>La Escuelita requested and was awarded $900 to host its annual Thanksgiving dinner with Hermanos Unidos for Isla Vista families on Nov. 23.</p>\n<p>La Escuelita representative and third-year political science major Cristina Hernandez said the event allows students and families in I.V. to enjoy the holiday together.</p>\n<p>“We prepare a traditional Thanksgiving dinner with turkey and mashed potatoes,” Hernandez said. “We hold this event because Isla Vista is very densely populated by college students and we often forget there are families in Isla Vista as well.”</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-66193\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Attainable, Accessible, Affordable UCSB Coalition (AAAC) hosted an event titled “Teach In” at the MultiCultural Center theater Thursday night to educate students about tuition fees and student debt and to promote the upcoming “Million Student March.”</p>\n<p>AAAC collaborated with several other student organizations such as the Student Union, Office of the Student Advocate, Associated Students External Vice President of Student Affairs Office, UCSB-4-Bernie, A.S. Office of the President and UCSB University of California Student Association to inform attendees about issues surrounding the student march which will be held on Nov. 12 at 12:00 p.m. at Storke Plaza. UCSB will join over 90 other colleges, including all nine UC’s (excluding UC San Francisco), in marching to demand free public university tuition, the cancellation of all student debt and the installation of a $15 minimum wage for all campus workers.</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) and fourth-year sociology and Black studies double-major Mohsin Mirza said the Donahoe Higher Education Act, alternatively referred to as the Master Plan for Higher Education in California, made tuition free for UC schools when the UC system was first founded in the 60s. According to Mirza, the act was in place up until Ronald Reagan imposed a “student fee” to attend the universities and diverted UC funding to other, less productive activities.</p>\n<p>“[Reagan] saw the UCs as promoting — basically handing out free education to a whole bunch of would-be communists,” Mirza said. “He saw the UC’s principles to educate people as dangerous, and this tied into his ideas, which were generally against public spending.”</p>\n<p>I.G.N.I.T.E. Coordinator for the EVPSA office and fourth-year biology major Clare Idehen said Reagan diverted UC funding to prison spending and mass incarceration, which “disproportionally” affects Blacks and Latinos more than other ethnicities in America with one in three black men going to prison in their lifetime.</p>\n<p>“Since the 80s, we’ve seen a huge 800 percent increase in the amount of people going to prison, and almost half of all the people incarcerated in prisons right now are for non-violent drug charges,” Idehen said. “Why are our prisons full of people who are non-violent?”</p>\n<p>According to Idehen, there are better ways to use the 80 billion dollars spent per year on mass incarceration in America.</p>\n<p>“With 80 billion dollars, we could provide preschool for every three-and-four-year-old in America, finance roads, bridges and airport jobs,” Idehen said. “And most importantly, allocate tuition at every public university and college.”<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Idehen said students around the globe are fighting for accessible education for all.</p>\n<p>“They’re fighting for the same thing we are,” Idehen said. “They’re not very different from us — they’re maybe 17 and 18, 19, maybe 16 years old going to college. They’re basically us. So it’s really great to stand in solidarity with these students, and I think it’s really important to know what’s happening.”</p>\n<p>UCSB United States Student Association Board of Directors Co-Chair and second-year political science major José Javier Magaña Mendoza said independent Vermont senator and democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders advocates for government subsidized college tuition through a Robin Hood Tax. According to Mendoza, it is an estate tax on stock and bond sales and a sales tax on commodities, debentures, derivatives and notes which will bring in an estimated 300 to 350 billion dollar in tax revenue.</p>\n<p>“How the tax works is that it’s just a small financial transaction tax on Wall Street, a tax that is 0.5 percent on stocks, 0.1 percent on bonds and 0.00 percent on derivatives,” Mendoza said. “This helps us because it will go to things such as jobs, housing, affordability, child care, healthcare, transportation and a big investment on the infrastructure. As students, it also goes to our higher education.”</p>\n<p>EVPSA officer, Teach In event organizer and second-year mathematics major Kyle Butts said internal UC worker union AFSCME 3299 supports the Million Student March because the union cares about students and agrees with the $15 minimum wage demand for all UC workers.</p>\n<p>“All nine UC’s, except UCSF, are holding marches, and AFSCME 3299 covers all those different areas, so they’re going to be having a voice in this, but mainly stand in solidarity,” Butts said.</p>\n<p>According to Butts, there has been a push for Chancellor Yang and the Vice Chancellors to attend the Million Student March.</p>\n<p>“All the A.S. Executives, the GSA president and the RHA president all signed letters requesting Chancellor Yang and all of the Vice Chancellors’ presence at this march,” Butts said. “We believe that this isn’t just a student issue or a worker’s issue, but this also has to do with UC as a whole.”</p>\n<p>Teach In speaker and third-year sociology major Alex Villegas said access to education is a global issue, and protests have been happening in London and Africa, with Africa’s protest breaking out into violence.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think a lot of people are really aware that our generation is facing this on a global level, and that we’re going to be impacted,” Villegas said. “It’s not just a temporary situation, but it’s something life-long.  It’s going to impact the future generations, and at the end of the day we’re going to end up inheriting all of this. Our leaders are setting us up for failure, so if we don’t take action now, we’re essentially all screwed.”</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major Casey Ramirez said he attended because he is struggling to afford tuition.</p>\n<p>“Debt is hard, and paying for things are a hardship,” Ramirez said. “It’s causing issues with my parents — we’re middle class and they have bad credit, so it’s hard to get loans.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said it will take a change in policy to ease the “deep debt” students in America are accumulating.</p>\n<p>“The money exists. We have enough money, we’re the richest country in the world to pay for free higher education,” Mirza said. “We all know all too well the impact the cost college can have on our families. The question is how can we make it so that this isn’t the case, so we can have the principle of free higher education.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66206\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-06/teach-in-event-held-to-discuss-tuition-fees-student-debt/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66206\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-06/teach-in-event-held-to-discuss-tuition-fees-student-debt/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-06/teach-in-event-held-to-discuss-tuition-fees-student-debt/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-06/teach-in-event-held-to-discuss-tuition-fees-student-debt/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-06/teach-in-event-held-to-discuss-tuition-fees-student-debt/","id":2640,"author":{"id":137,"name":"Mohan Saxena"},"related":[2639,2638,2637],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"LGBTQ Studies To Revitalize its Minor","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Department of Feminist Studies plans to expand the LGBTQ Minor by adding three new classes; two in Winter quarter and one during Spring New Director of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2>The Department of Feminist Studies plans to expand the LGBTQ Minor by adding three new classes; two in Winter quarter and one during Spring</h2>\n<p>New Director of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) studies minor and assistant professor Jennifer Tyburczy plans to revitalize the Department of Feminist Studies’ LGBTQ minor, which has been offered since 2004.</p>\n<p>Tyburczy aims to offer students a comprehensive background in new LGBTQ theories as well as the global history of LGBTQ studies. The minor currently provides an interdisciplinary examination of the lives, experiences, identities and representations of LGBTQ individuals. Students seeking the LGBTQ studies minor will take feminist studies courses in addition to a variety of interdisciplinary courses.</p>\n<p>Tyburczy said she wants the minor to connect with social issues from around the world and focus on LGBTQ developments within the UCSB student population.</p>\n<p>“Top priorities will include strengthening the intersections of gender and sexuality studies with race, ethnicity, class, and disability studies from a national and transnational lens, forging new social justice and scholarly ties across disciplines,” Tyburczy said in an email.</p>\n<p>Tyburczy said the minor is expanding with two new courses being offered during next Winter quarter and one new course during Spring quarter.</p>\n<p>“I will offer two new courses this winter: an upper-division undergraduate course called ‘Trans-Art’ that will explore transgender, genderqueer, and gender fluid artists and artworks across genres and geographies in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries and a queer theory graduate course,” Tyburczy said in email. “In the spring, I will offer an undergraduate version of queer theory.”</p>\n<p>According to Tyburczy, the minor will be tailored to better prepare the student body for future careers in a variety of fields.</p>\n<p>“Students will gain broad knowledge in a growing segment of the national and global population that remains little understood by mainstream institutions,” Tyburczy said in email. “This knowledge can be employed in a variety of arenas: from activism and public advocacy work, to the law and the health sciences, to the arts and educational environments.”</p>\n<p>Second-year communication major Ciara Baker, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, said the LGBTQ studies minor educates students on global issues concerning sexuality, gender and identities and understanding systematic marginalization through critical thinking.</p>\n<p>“I think the minor is important because it produces well-rounded students because of the intersectionality it covers and it also makes students more aware, so that they can be more inclusive and successful in any career that they choose,” Baker said in an email. “The LGBTQ minor allows UCSB students to broaden their field of study and understand race, gender, and other identities.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Madeline Stefani said she is pursuing the minor because it focuses on viewing “gender rigidity” as one of the main causes of inequality.</p>\n<p>“I think that it covers important movements in our history as humans that are not covered anywhere else and gives students the opportunity to explore social issues, especially ones relating to the LGBTQ community,” Stefani said in an email. “It’s another area of marginalization that is not really discussed in the history courses. I think it should be just as important as an ethnicity requirement.”</p>\n<p>Feminist studies professor Leila Rupp said many students pursue the minor to better understand the identities of their loved ones.</p>\n<p>“Some students do the minor for personal reasons, either because they are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer or have family members who are and want to understand the place of sexuality, in combination with other factors, in shaping life experiences,” Rupp said in an email.</p>\n<p>Rupp said students also enter the program to better recognize the problems of LGBTQ members in intellectual and career-oriented domains.</p>\n<p>“Some students pursue the minor for professional reasons, so that in their chosen careers they understand the lives, experiences, and

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gutierrez discussed her rise to prominence after interrupting President Barack Obama during the White House’s LGBT Pride Reception in June. At the reception, Gutierrez called the abuse of detained LGBTQ undocumented immigrants to Obama’s attention, demanding an end to their deportation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gutierrez said trans women who are also undocumented immigrants are placed in detention centers along with men, creating a situation where they often face harassment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of the conditions that our undocumented transgender women face is very heartbreaking and dehumanizing,” Gutierrez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gutierrez said she was inspired by transgender activist and UCSB alumna Zoraida Reyes, and realized LGBTQ women and undocumented immigrants can lead activism movements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Zoraida [Reyes] showed me that we have the capacity to be at the center of the movement, to join the conversations, be an important part of it and move the movement in the right direction,” Gutierrez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gutierrez said she sought legal advice before interrupting Obama at the White House and was told not to speak out because she could face criminal charges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was being told to shut up, to take all the abuse — ‘You are a trans woman, you are undocumented, you are nothing,’” Gutierrez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gutierrez said she is tired of being “dehumanized” and will challenge power even at the cost of her own life.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66199\" style=\"width: 770px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Gutierrez_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1711786333\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66212\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66199\" data-attachment-id=\"66199\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-08/jennicet-gutierrez-advocates-for-marginalized-groups-at-the-hub/gutierrez_by-riley-esguerra-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Gutierrez_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?fit=760%2C507&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"760,507\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Riley Esguerra\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1446711956\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"148\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Gutierrez_by Riley Esguerra-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Gutierrez_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Gutierrez_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?fit=760%2C507&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-66199\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Gutierrez_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?resize=760%2C507\" alt=\"Riley Esguerra/Daily Nexus\" width=\"760\" height=\"507\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Gutierrez_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?w=760&amp;ssl=1 760w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Gutierrez_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66199\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riley Esguerra/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My power has been taken away so many times, but by confronting the president, I regained my power and I regained my dignity,” Gutierrez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gutierrez said that everyone is important in the movement to defend the rights of LGBTQ undocumented immigrants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are the true leaders,” Gutierrez said. “Just the fact we exist is revolutionary. We are challenging the norms, social injustices.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director of UCSB’s Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity David Whitman said it is important to host activists like Gutierrez because students of color and undocumented students grow up with few role models they can identify with.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[UCSB is] providing students with possibility models, where people can see themselves represented, sometimes for the first time in their whole life, [and] are able to gain a sense of confidence, sense of empowerment, a sense of encouragement,” Whitman said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First-year political science major Ricardo Uribe said he enjoyed hearing Gutierrez’s life story and learned how to effectively work toward equality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you want to make change, do so with respect; do so where you get your message across while you are respecting the people around you,” Uribe said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year political science major Mariel Islas said she first met Gutierrez at the UC Student Association congress last year and was compelled to attend Thursday’s discussion after seeing her take a stance at the White House.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She is a trans Latina woman and undocumented — that’s a lot of marginalized communities and identities into one person, and just seeing her have so much power and so much courage — it’s inspiring,” Islas said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gutierrez said she enjoys reading poetry and concluded the evening by reading the audience a poem she wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The status quo wanted me to remain a broken soul; activism empowered and repaired my soul, and activism empowered my existence.
