Mitine said organizing the event was fun because she loves Christmas and the winter season.</p>\n<p>“Decorating was fun,” Mitine said. “The holiday times are my favorite, so doing a program like this was not a problem.”</p>\n<p>Third-year biology major Yaneli Gutierrez said her favorite part of the party was decorating cookies, which she modeled after her reindeer sweater. Gutierrez also said she attended the party because she enjoys Christmas and ugly sweaters.</p>\n<p>“The tackier the better,” Gutierrez said.</p>\n<p>Aranki said she wanted to host a fun holiday party as a “de-stresser” for her residents.</p>\n<p>“I really care about residents a lot, especially their mental well-being,” Aranki said.</p>\n<p>Mitine said she hoped the event would be a fun way to bring the residents together.</p>\n<p>“Everyone always talks about how they miss being home for the holidays,” Mitine said. “Dead Week and finals are so stressful.”</p>\n<p>Mitine said the Loma Pelona Center was chosen for the event because it is between Manzanita and San Rafael residence halls and facilitates opportunities to meet other students.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s just a nice way to get people out of their room or away from the library for a little bit and to all be out here together,” Mitine said.</p>\n<p>Third year biology major Heidi Lee said Christmas is one of her favorite holidays because she gets to spend time with friends and family.</p>\n<p>“I want to skip over finals and get to break,” Lee said.</p>\n<p>International student from Belgium Annelies Leenknecht said she is currently taking classes at Santa Barbara City College on a gap year.</p>\n<p>Leenknecht said she enjoyed attending the party in preparation for winter break, although she wishes she was returning to Santa Barbara in January.</p>\n<p>“I wish I could come back here afterwards,” Leenknecht said. “I have to stay home unfortunately.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

held its first meeting to discuss social justice and civil rights at the Goleta Valley Conference Room last Wednesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SPLC is a national organization focusing on a three-pronged strategy to tackle racial and social injustice by fighting hate, teaching tolerance and finding justice. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB club will seek to meet these objectives through educational initiatives, advocacy and collaboration with existing groups which share similar concerns.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The club’s specific plans are to have police sensitivity training, create a coalition with other activist groups and host a “Know Your Rights” event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SPLC Advisor and UCSB professor of classics Rose MacLean said the</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> goals of the club are to combat hate, promote positive change, and protect civil rights by focusing on the legal details.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is essential that members of the community know their rights and have access to quality legal advice and representation,” MacLean said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Club President third-year environmental studies and French double major Sebastianne Kent said the university needs clubs that fight hate groups, and that she encourages students to get involved.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “It doesn’t take your whole life and all of your time to do something that’s going to change peoples’ lives,” Kent said. “It just takes you deciding that’s what you want to do and finding other people who feel the same way.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kent said she feels SPLC differs from other activist groups because it advocates for anyone treated poorly because of their race, gender, identity or religion instead of focusing on a specific demographic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are a lot of activist groups here that do amazing work, but SPLC has a history of advocating for everybody who is a victim of discrimination,” Kent said. “I think not only is that important, for everybody to feel like they have a safe space, but for them to feel like they have some kind of information about how to take action.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Club Secretary General and third-year sociology major Sanjukta Koppolu said she appreciates the club’s inclusive mentality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s important because you have to realize that in an environment like a college campus, you are part of a community, so I think everyone is obligated to help each other out,” Koppolu said. “It shouldn’t be just women dealing with sexism or people of color dealing with racism. It should be everyone.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Club Vice President and third-year English and psychology double major Caterina Lazzara, said she is interested in the club’s focus on legal rights.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanted to get involved here and make policy changes that would prevent these injustices from happening in the future,” Lazzara said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66808\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/students-come-together-for-first-meeting-of-new-social-justice-group/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66808\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/students-come-together-for-first-meeting-of-new-social-justice-group/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/students-come-together-for-first-meeting-of-new-social-justice-group/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/students-come-together-for-first-meeting-of-new-social-justice-group/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-25/students-come-together-for-first-meeting-of-new-social-justice-group/","id":2597,"author":{"id":117,"name":"Effie Sklavenitis"},"related":[2596,2595,2594],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"International Students Share Thanksgiving Experiences","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-new-logo.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-new-logo.png?resize=512%2C512&ssl=1","description":"Thanksgiving is known around the world as an American holiday where family and friends come together to give thanks over comfort food.

The holiday is only celebrated in a handful of locations including the United States, Canada, Norfolk Island, Puerto Rico and Liberia.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> spoke to international students and those studying abroad at UCSB to see how their Thanksgiving experiences compared to the images they had of the holiday.</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Alice Lomas is from Devon, England, and said she had an idealized image of Thanksgiving from American media.</p>\n<p>“I had seen [Thanksgiving] in all the American films, and I thought it was a massive family gathering with a turkey and a traditional Sunday roast experience, similar to what our Christmas is like,” Lomas said.</p>\n<p>While Lomas said she cooked and spent the holiday with friends, she said it was lacking because family is what makes the tradition special.</p>\n<p>“It kind of lived up to the expectations, but because we didn’t have our own family there, it was not the same,” Lomas said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Cæcilie Køhler is from Copenhagen, Denmark, and said she understood Thanksgiving after watching television shows and movies portraying the American tradition, which she added is similar to a Danish Christmas.</p>\n<p>“It’s like this in Denmark during Christmas. Some people even eat so much that they have to go to the hospital,” Køhler said, laughing.</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Xiaoyu Li from Beijing, China, compared his Thanksgiving experience in the U.S. to festivals in China because of Black Friday sales.</p>\n<p>“In China, there isn’t Thanksgiving, but there is a festival there that all the shops celebrate . . . It’s like a Black Friday sale,” Li said.</p>\n<p>Li said while he ate turkey and went Black Friday shopping during his first year at UCSB, this year he decided to spend it with friends making traditional Chinese food.</p>\n<p>“I went to Big Bear with a group of students and ate hot pot [an East Asian stew],” Li said.</p>\n<p>Second-year mathematical science major Omicron Wang from Chongqing, China, likened Thanksgiving to Spring Festival, known as Chinese New Year.</p>\n<p>“This is a time where every member of the family comes together,” Wang said. “We regard Thanksgiving in the U.S. as a regular holiday.”</p>\n<p>Second-year financial mathematics major Jennifer Sun from the Shandong province of China said although the food and traditions may be different, the values of the Chinese New Year and American Thanksgiving are similar.</p>\n<p>“When the Chinese New Year comes, we renew together and make traditional food like dumplings, just like people in the U.S. make traditional food and spend it with family,” Sun said.</p>\n<p>Second-year statistics major Shiwei Hua from Wuhan, China, said American Thanksgiving is similar to the Lunar Festival in China in some ways, but differs in others.</p>\n<p>“The Lunar Festival is when everywhere from the family gets together and eats traditional foods,” Hua said. “It’s a time for family to get together. I thought there would be many people in the street because during Lunar New Year we have games and puzzles all in the street.”</p>\n<p>Regardless of location or name, holidays provide an opportunity to celebrate one’s culture with the people, food and traditions that are important to them.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Students were able to walk through the new paseo entrance Monday and explore 60,000 square feet and three stories of brand new space, which students hope will alleviate library traffic, especially during finals week.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Metzger, assistant university librarian for outreach and academic collaboration, said plans for the renovation had been “in the works for almost two decades,” due partially to rising enrollment.</p>\n<p>“If you have spent any time in the library, you have seen that it’s really packed with students all the time,” Metzger said. “By the time we began [construction], the library hadn’t been touched in 35 years.”</p>\n<p>The project was largely made possible by an approximately $80 million state grant, and Metzger said the library is “continuing to raise money for furnishings, technology, collections and other initiatives.”</p>\n<p>The construction appeared to be ahead of schedule in the summer, and school officials estimated the library would open earlier than expected, but the construction was completed in line with the initial timeframe.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67162\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67162\" data-attachment-id=\"67162\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-05/renovated-library-portions/newlibrary_eric-swenson-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1451912299\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"35\",\"iso\":\"140\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"New Library Opening\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67162\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=650%2C434\" alt=\"Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus\" width=\"650\" height=\"434\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67162\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Metzger said the first few students in the building Monday encountered some surprises, and she warned students to expect some kinks that will be worked out in the coming days.</p>\n<p>“There were definitely some hiccups on opening day morning,” Metzger said. “There were some alarms going off, some doors opening that shouldn’t be opening. People should be a little bit patient with coming back.”</p>\n<p>Students in the library Monday evening said they were enjoying the new library, though, and praised its new design and spaces.</p>\n<p>“I love it. It’s a shocking difference from the old library; the new spaces are so nice,” third-year political science major Cristina Hernandez said. “I use the computers in the library all the time, so having all these new options of where to do that is going to be good.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez lives on Sabado Tarde Road in Isla Vista, which she said has led her to rely on the library for a quiet study space.</p>\n<p>“I can’t study in my apartment,” Hernandez said. “I just will never get homework done there. If I want to get anything done, I’m always at the library.”</p>\n<p>The University of California system plans to enroll 5,000 additional in-state students among its nine campuses next year, and 5,000 more over the subsequent two years. Hernandez said she thought the renovations were necessary to keep up with the new students.</p>\n<p>“Within my last couple of years, I could already tell the library was getting more and more packed every year, so it definitely came at a good time,” Hernandez said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year chemistry major Ian Davis works at the circulation desk and said he was enjoying his first shift in the new library.</p>\n<p>“The old space, we worked at circulation over there and it was a lot more cramped,” Davis said. “Here, we obviously have this huge area, which is pretty nice.”</p>\n<p>Davis said he was most excited for the ability to reserve study areas online, “so you don’t have to have someone in your group get there at 8 a.m. and kind of post up. You can do it on your own time which is more convenient for everyone.”</p>\n<p>Third-year electrical engineering major Chris Claycomb was reading a book in one of the study areas in the new library Monday evening, and said he liked being able to “kill some time” before making the commute home to downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Claycomb left UCSB after his sophomore year to study at the United States Naval Academy and is returning this year to complete his degree. He said he remembered a much busier library before the addition.</p>\n<p>“I just remember you would go to the old library and, at least during finals and midterms, you would have to wander three floors to find a room, especially if you were with a group of people,” Claycomb said.</p>\n<p>For this reason, Claycomb said he “only used the library a few times” before the addition, but thought he would “give it a shot” after seeing the addition and renovations.</p>\n<p>There will be a formal opening for the library on Jan. 13, when Chancellor Henry T. Yang will speak and A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal will announce that the senior class gift will be designated for the library, according to Metzger.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nicholas-bogel-burroughs/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>test description</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:sdjklfh@kjasdn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67160\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-05/renovated-library-portions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67160\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-05/renovated-library-portions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-05/renovated-library-portions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-05/renovated-library-portions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-05/renovated-library-portions/","id":2598,"author":{"id":113,"name":"Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"},"related":[2597,2596,2595],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
