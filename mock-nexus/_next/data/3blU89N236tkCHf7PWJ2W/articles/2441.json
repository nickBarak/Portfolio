His item of interest: a bright red, wooden phallus measuring about two feet long with dark hair sprouting out of the base.</p>\n<p>The story behind the phallus begins in Bhutan, a small country located between India and China, which was greatly influenced by Tibetan Buddhism. Early in Bhutan’s history, it was believed a mad yogi named Drukpa Kunley traveled from Tibet and drew crowds with his crazy antics.</p>\n<p>His greatest skill was seducing female demons with his charisma and “defeating” them with his phallus.</p>\n<p>To this day, the people of Bhutan still celebrate Drukpa’s genitals. Hillis has taken several trips to Bhutan.</p>\n<p>“There are pictures of his penis everywhere,” he said. “Then you will see [phalluses] just hanging in people’s homes and temples to ward off demons.”</p>\n<p>He bought his phallus from a local shop in Bhutan. Hillis has used it as a prop in his Tibetan religion and intro to religion classes.</p>\n<p>“When I would show the class, some of the smart alecks would respond with ‘it’s a dildo,’” Hillis said.</p>\n<p>The phallus definitely grabbed his students’ attention. However, Hillis said it represents something different than a dildo: “Sex and the power of procreation is holy, and it’s amazing … What makes a religion a religion is that it is connected in some way to what people think is holy or sacred.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74265\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74265\" data-attachment-id=\"74265\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/a-peek-through-professors-office-doors/candace-waid-online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Candace-Waid-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=1500%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"candace-waid-online-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Candace-Waid-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Candace-Waid-ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-74265 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Candace-Waid-ONLINE-1-768x1024.jpg?resize=768%2C1024\" alt=\"candace-waid-online-1\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Candace-Waid-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Candace-Waid-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Candace-Waid-ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-74265\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Rebekah Akiyoshi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>The Colors of Candace Waid’s Office</strong><br>\nBright colors of red, yellow and green illuminate the walls of Candace Waid’s office.

Also notable, she is the author of The Signifying Eye: Seeing Faulkner’s Art, an in-depth study of William Faulkner’s abstract art.</p>\n<p>These paintings and drawings were all given to her as gifts from former students, some who went on to become painters. Asked why students give her art, she said, “they know I care about color, and I’m all about paintings.” Some of the titles of the paintings in her office include “Alien Corn,” “Oklahoma Alabama” and “Guadalupe.”</p>\n<p>A still-life above Waid’s computer is credited as the work of a past first-year student, Natalie O’Brien. She credits O’Brien for founding The Catalyst, a magazine of poems, stories and art submitted by UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Together, they worked on the “digital fires of the Internet” to study ekphrasis, art expressing another form of art, like a poem talking about a painting.</p>\n<p>“These paintings bring joy to me.

At the end of her classes, she receives many little gifts from students who appreciate her teachings.</p>\n<p>One of her prized possessions stands on her windowsill, serving as a constant reminder of her favorite reason for teaching. Given to her by a former student back in 1990, a Darth Vader action figure with a swivel base and standing at eight inches tall strikes fear in all who enter her office.</p>\n<p>The movie series “Star Wars” serves as her teaching metaphor to the classic epic story, <em>Beowulf</em>. The hero of the story, Beowulf, takes on the dark monster, Grendel.</p>\n<p>“Beowulf is taking on the dark side … you have to take on the opposing forces of evil … often take the form of a relative,” she said.</p>\n<p>Fumerton uses this comparison in her classes because “as students hear it, they connect very quickly.” She loves to connect bigger concepts like good versus evil back to students’ lives.</p>\n<p>“I treasure these plastic gifts, because they mean the student gets it, and it means enough to them that they want to give me a memento … it’s my connection to the students,” Fumerton said. “Whenever I look at him, I remember how fun it was teaching <em>Beowulf</em>.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74278\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74278\" data-attachment-id=\"74278\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/a-peek-through-professors-office-doors/professor-lee-by-josh-ortiz-online-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"professor-lee-by-josh-ortiz-online-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74278\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Josh Ortiz / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Professor-Lee-by-Josh-Ortiz-online-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-74278\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Josh Ortiz / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>Remembering WWI with John W.I. Lee</strong><br>\nJohn W.I. Lee is an associate professor at UCSB and has worked here for the past 16 years. He is currently on leave writing his book and taking care of his new baby, born this past summer. In his office, Lee displays an array of 10 helmets from World War I.</p>\n<p>These helmets are a timeline of steel integration. Before the war, people had romantic ideas of war and wore decorative caps that did not protect their heads. As trench warfare increased, so did reported head injuries.</p>\n<p>Lee highlights a specific helmet called the French Adrian, which was the first mass-produced steel helmet in Europe.</p>\n<p>“We are living in a world shaped by the outcome of WWI,” said Lee, who studies changing warfare throughout history.</p>\n<p>For the past year, Lee has been working on a project to commemorate the 100th anniversary of WWI. He invited first-year student Sydney Martin to help with extensive research and report write-ups. The project will be an exhibition to display the helmets for UCSB students to view firsthand.</p>\n<p>“There is nothing better to educate others than having them see it up front and personal,” Lee said.</p>\n<p>Lee is borrowing these helmets from a local collector in Santa Barbara, who is interested in history and student learning. For those interested in learning more about WWI, this exhibition will be on display on the first floor of the UCSB library in November.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74221\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74221\" data-attachment-id=\"74221\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/a-peek-through-professors-office-doors/6o2a8930/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"6o2a8930\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74221\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6O2A8930.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-74221\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>Samuel Sweet’s Botanical Indoor Garden</strong><br>\nSamuel Sweet is a professor of ecology and evolution who knows a few things about keeping plants alive.

UC Santa Barbara is the first UC campus to host her.</p>\n<p>“Dear brothers and sisters,” she began, a phrase she repeated multiple times. “I am so proud to be here.”</p>\n<p>She expressed her “sadness and anger” at violent events that have occurred in Syria, especially those in her region, such as the recent chemical weapons attack in Syria that she blamed on Assad’s tyrannical regime.</p>\n<p>She focused her lecture on tyranny and the Arab Spring, which she described as a “response to the decay of justice.”</p>\n<p>“Our revolution is not a fleeting whim, but needs that we have had for many years,” she said.</p>\n<p>Karman organized student rallies in Sana’a, the largest city in Yemen and was imprisoned several times in 2011. In Yemen’s opposition movement, she is known as the “Iron Woman” and described going to prison as the “best moment of [her] life.”</p>\n<p>“They were stupid when they took me to the jail, because it made me very strong,” she said.</p>\n<p>Karman’s incarceration led to Yemeni people rioting in the streets, calling for her release and repeating her chants, which engaged students in the revolution.</p>\n<p>She also spoke about both President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama, expressing her disappointment with their relationships with Syria.</p>\n<p>When asked about her views of Obama, she said she “expected a lot from him, as a human,” but found herself disappointed.</p>\n<p>“I blame him on the bloodshed in Syria,” she said. “I believe that he could stop the bloodshed.”</p>\n<p>Despite this, Karman said she respects him and believes he did great things within the U.S.</p>\n<p>Karman went on to criticize President Trump’s travel ban, which she called a violation of international human rights and “values as an American.”</p>\n<p>“Whoever brands Muslims with terror is not only lying and ignorant, he is directly and indirectly helping terrorism,” she said.</p>\n<p>She also spoke about how religion was used against her and other women who tried to demonstrate.</p>\n<p>“Dictators use religion to build walls between nations,” she said. “All of us should be against the bad religious people who translate religion in a bad way.”</p>\n<p>She urged the audience to take responsibility to protect their values, including “peace, love, coexistence and democracy.”</p>\n<p>Karman spoke extensively about terrorism and said despotism and terrorism are two sides of the same coin.</p>\n<p>According to Karman, the Western “catastrophic failure” in the Iraq War created conditions for the Islamic State (I.S.). She also said she believes Assad created I.S. to stop the peaceful Syrian revolution.</p>\n<p>“Silence has given Assad the permission to keep killing the Syrian people,” she said. “We don’t accept any choice between terrorism and despotism. The only choice we will make and we will win and we will struggle for is democracy.”</p>\n<p>Karman did express hope for the future and said university students are a part of the generation “that will protect the world better than we are doing now.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t let anyone to steal your values,” she said to the students in the audience. “You are the creator of the future, my son, my daughter. Be a leader; the world needs you.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Senate meeting two weeks ago to oppose the College Republicans event.</p>\n<p>Professors suggested creating a list of “sanctuary” faculty members who are available to support students who are distressed. The idea is modeled after the “sanctuary campus,” a symbolic designation with special powers.</p>\n<p>Sanctuary campuses can protect students from deportation, certain federal immigration laws and other threats, similar to sanctuary cities. The movement has emerged at Tufts, Rutgers, Yale, Stanford and several other universities after Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, followed by multiple protests throughout the country.</p>\n<p>At an A.S. Senate meeting Tuesday, A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez presented an alternative for students who didn’t wish to contribute to the College Republicans event.</p>\n<p>The Compulsory Fee Refund Application allows students to withdraw their portion of student funding from specific programs and is a product of a 1993 California Supreme Court Decision: Smith v. Regents.</p>\n<p>The court ruled in 1993 that the UC cannot force students to pay for events that pursue political or ideological goals through “compulsion and coercion.”</p>\n<p>“This specific ruling was obviously brought up at this specific meeting because one of the administrators who has a lot of ties with a lot of these left-leaning organizations,” Andrew Gates, College Republicans president, told the Nexus during the Senate meeting Wednesday, adding that the ruling could work against “left-leaning” events.</p>\n<p>“We have, what, one event per quarter? But if you divide 5,000 by 23,000 students … compare that with the countless left-leaning events that you know all the conservative students could, like, get a refund for,” he said.</p>\n<p>At the faculty meeting one hour prior, Sanchez quoted comments from the College Republican’s YouTube video of the Nov. 3 Senate meeting. The comments can only be removed by the owner of the account, or YouTube if the comments are reported.</p>\n<p>“Lets get these cunts. Comment a link to the BLM fascists facebook page, I’ll trigger these scumbags,” one comment reads.</p>\n<p>“Dis what fatherless iq 85 african americans been taught by iq 130 jews who think whites nazist. ethnic weapons,” read another comment on a repost of the video, which College Republicans cannot regulate. Ladijah Corder, co-chair of UCSB Black Student Union, later recited the same comment to the Senate during public forum.</p>\n<p>Tamara Afifi, professor of communication, said while advocacy may interrupt scholarly work, it is the responsibility of non-minorities to support activists. “It’s up to us,” she said.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of white people are scared to say something stupid; they’re scared to be vulnerable,” she said. “It’s not up to people of color to educate them, they have enough placed on them.”</p>\n<p>Armistead, who has been a vocal advocate of students who are against the College Republicans program, said “We need to take our campus back.”</p>\n<p>“I’m upset, too,” Armistead said. “It kills me because I’m the one who ultimately has to make this event successful.”</p>\n<p>Other faculty members built a suggestion list, including attending the event en masse to occupy seats and arguing with Ben Shapiro point by point during his lecture.</p>\n<p>Demetrius Ous, a UCSB graduate student, suggested planning counter events at the same time of the College Republicans events.</p>\n<p>“The point of these events is expressing joy and love for one another,” he said. “If you see hatred, you should show it a smile because hatred is going on.”</p>\n<p>The conversation culminated with an initial push to create buttons for faculty to wear during the event. The buttons would be emblems of inclusivity, saying “UCSB Against Hate.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Correction: The second comment was shared on a repost of the College Republicans’ video, not on the College Republicans account.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74307\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/faculty-join-free-speech-dialogue/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74307\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/faculty-join-free-speech-dialogue/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/faculty-join-free-speech-dialogue/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/faculty-join-free-speech-dialogue/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/faculty-join-free-speech-dialogue/","id":2440,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2439,2438,2437],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
