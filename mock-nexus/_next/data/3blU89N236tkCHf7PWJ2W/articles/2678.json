F&amp;B) met Oct. 5th in the UCen State Street room to consider 14 funding requests from 12 campus organizations.</p>\n<p>The committee began its meeting with $57,198.05 in Office of Student Life (OSL) funds, $8,665.26 in senate unallocated, $45,0000 in Student Initiated Outreach Program, $45,000 in culture weeks and graduations, $30,0000 for sports teams and $17,164 for academic teams. The committee fully granted six requests, partially granted six requests and tabled two requests.</p>\n<p>Delta Sigma Pi requested $656 for a campus event and $2,300 to send five members to the Leadership and Excellence Academies for Deltasigs in New Mexico.</p>\n<p>Delta Sigma Pi member Austin Kang said the group’s first request was for an Oct. 23 event to educate UCSB students about the nonprofit organization Liberty in North Korea, which helps North Koreans escape to other countries.</p>\n<p>“We are hopeful that [this event] will bring awareness about the condition and the situations that people in North Korea live in,” Kang said. “There is going to be at least one refugee that will speak.”</p>\n<p>The committee fully funded the group $656 but tabled its request for $2,300 to the Oct. 12 meeting.</p>\n<p>KCSB representative Matt Merritt requested $2,000 for Hello World!, a music festival on Oct. 10 in Anisq’Oyo’ Park that will feature Scientist, The Lions and Cornerstone.</p>\n<p>“We are bringing these groups, musical groups, from all around the world to come and perform,” Merritt said. “We are educating the community on these groups and their cultures. And then also educational in the sense that we are bringing members of our own community in one place to appreciate and discover each other’s culture.”</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund KCSB.</p>\n<p>UCSB League of Legends (L.o.L.) treasurer Elaine Hu and public relations chair Albert Chen requested $80 for a gaming event Oct. 11at the Loma Pelona Center.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund UCSB L.o.L.</p>\n<p>Swing and Ballroom Dance Club co-treasurer Cecilia Gutierrez and president Steve Carlan requested $2,594 for a free swing dance event Oct. 24 in the Student Resource Building.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fund the club $1,460 for a band, refreshments and Community Service Officers (CSO’s) at the event.</p>\n<p>Cotillion Dance Club treasurer Alex Vera and vice president Samuel Anspach requested $2,921 for the club’s annual dance competition, Beach Ball.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fund the club $2,120 to hire professional dancers for the event.</p>\n<p>Transfer Student Alliance requested for $426 for their first general meeting on Oct. 14 in the Student Resource Building.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund the group for its upcoming event.</p>\n<p>On-campus senator and second-year political science major José Magaña requested $2,474 from senate unallocated funds for condom dispensers to place in bathrooms around campus.</p>\n<p>CCS Collegiate Senator and third-year CCS chemistry and biochemistry major Dustin Larrazolo said the committee should fund Magaña’s project, because it fully granted KCSB’s request.</p>\n<p>“Safe sex is more important than a broadcasting radio station’s event,” Larrazolo said.</p>\n<p>Kevin Koo recommended Magaña request funds through a campus organization in order to access OSL funds as opposed to senate unallocated.</p>\n<p>“He is working with other student groups and OSL groups,” Koo said. “He could just come in next week.”</p>\n<p>The committee voted to table Magaña’s request until its Oct. 12 meeting, suggesting he seek other funding options throughout the week.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B then voted to fund Lindy Circle $2,000 out of its first request of $2,743, as well as $520 of its second request of $580.</p>\n<p>Alpha Tau Omega (ATO) member Charles Jones requested $7,995 for its annual, three-day Greeks 4 Kids fundraising event, which includes a carnival, dodgeball tournament and dance-off.</p>\n<p>The committee funded ATO $6,595, including $3,200 to rent Campbell Hall for the dance-off.</p>\n<p>Professor of sociology John Foran requested $1,006 on behalf of System Change Not Climate Change for the group’s upcoming conference, 21st Century Ecosocialism: Practicing System Change, Making Connections, Building a Movement, which will take place Oct. 9 through Oct. 11.</p>\n<p>Foran said the conference is an opportunity to educate students who are not taking classes about environmental issues.</p>\n<p>“Certainly this is something that should be of great interest to our students in a number of other classes on campus,” Foran said.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund System Change Not Climate Change.</p>\n<p>The committee then voted to grant UCSB Students for Bernie Sanders the $175 it requested for a Democratic presidential debate viewing event Oct. 13 in the Hub and to grant BSU the $590 it requested.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article did not include the entirety of Larrazolo’s quote and misnamed his majors.

Speakers shared their experiences coming out during the initial portion of the event, followed by an open mic for attendees to share their own stories.</p>\n<p>Third-year history major William Roberts said the event communicated the “diversity of experiences” people have when coming out.</p>\n<p>“Revealing [coming out] as not to be the one-time event … but as a complex, sometimes difficult, but ultimately beautiful and liberating experience felt differently by all queer and trans people,” Roberts said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year communication major Jean Mack, whose name has been changed, said she has a “split lifestyle” because she has not come out as bisexual in her hometown in Northern California but is involved with many LGBTQ events at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“It’s very freeing to be in a community where you can be your whole self,” Mack said. “I think for many people, especially coming in as freshmen, it’s their first experience where they can be around queer people.”</p>\n<p>Mack said she was comfortable speaking at the “Coming Out Monologues” because organizers reached out to a wide range of identities when advertising the event.</p>\n<p>“I think a very subtle thing … which I hope they continue doing, is putting all sorts of identities on the poster itself for the event,” Mack said. “[It] was a big deal for me because, as a bisexual woman, I often feel like I’m not straight enough for straight places and I’m not queer enough for gay spaces so it’s this weird in-between.”</p>\n<p>Second-year chemistry major Shelley Alvarez, whose name and year have been changed, said being queer at UCSB is “a lot less alienating” than she expected, but finding spaces for everyday interactions is still difficult.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the settings in which people congregate to are very sexual in nature, or they involve a lot of drinking and hook-ups and sometimes you just want to find a group of people to hang out with and have fun with,” Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>According to RCGSD Graduate Assistant and Ph.D. candidate Alex Kulick, LGBTQ communities and resources on campus and in I.V. need to be made more apparent to students.</p>\n<p>“I think one of the big issues that I’ve noticed really is a lack of visibility,” Kulick said. “There’s certainly a lot of spaces, especially in Isla Vista, that are not necessarily visibly queer or don’t have any visible presence of queer-friendly spaces.”</p>\n<p>Kulick said it was his first time attending the “Coming Out Monologues.”</p>\n<p>“I was just really, really impressed by the courage of the students and the vulnerability that they were able to share, and also, I think the diversity of the experiences that were showcased along different lines of gender, race, ethnicity, class and, of course, all types of different other experiences that people come from.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The demonstration was successful in gaining cooperation from UCSB administrators. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Five months after students gathered for a 13-hour sit-in at Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s office to present 13 demands regarding campus sexual assault policy, administrators are continuing to collaborate with students on various improvements to support survivors and punish perpetrators.</p>\n<p>The May sit-in led by student group #NowUCSB, formerly “It’s Not On Us, It’s On You,” resulted in Yang agreeing to consider a list of 13 demands, including stricter punishments for offenders, improved sensitivity training for faculty and staff and greater diversity among on-campus aid groups and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP). The farthest-reaching policy change from the demands is a UC-wide requirement in June for all faculty and staff to undergo sexual violence and consent training. Other changes include increased sexual assault training for IVFP deputies and advertising for the Sexual Assault Survivor Fund on campus, which provides financial support to survivors to cover immediate expenses.</p>\n<p>#NowUCSB leader and third-year Chican@ studies major Alejandra Melgoza said while an estimated 95 percent of the demands are in progress, the bureaucracy involved with certain demands has caused delayed implementation.</p>\n<p>“So many survivors for so many years have been waiting for these changes to happen, and, right now, we have policy demands that we have to make happen,” Melgoza said. “Because of all the red tape we have to go through, it will take a long time.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said while the support of students and staff pressured the administration to make changes, ongoing education is still necessary to the movement’s success.</p>\n<p>“I have been very grateful for the support from Associated Students, faculty, staff, grad students and workers across the campus,” Melgoza said. “It has made an impact, and people are aware of it, but it’s very important to highlight to the new incoming class. They need to know what happened last year so that they can support it.”</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming said with the start of the new academic year, more students will become involved in the campaign.</p>\n<p>“There has been progress on many of the thirteen demands, though we have been waiting for students to return to get their feedback and involvement in several of the demand areas,” Fleming said in an email. “I am hoping to see a diverse group of students established with whom staff and administrators can meet on a regular, perhaps monthly, basis to discuss issues of sexual and interpersonal violence.”</p>\n<p>#NowUCSB’s first three demands, which request students found guilty of sexual assault be immediately suspended for a minimum of four quarters and removed from campus, have to be approved by UC Office of the President. According to Fleming, the President’s Task Force on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Violence and Sexual Assault will soon release updated UC-wide policies.</p>\n<p>“There is a system-wide committee that is part of President Napolitano’s Taskforce on Sexual Violence and Sexual Assault that is about to issue new UC adjudication and sanctioning guidelines, so the Office of Judicial Affairs is waiting for these guidelines to inform any changes related to adjudication of sexual assault cases and disciplinary sanctions,” Fleming said in an email.</p>\n<p>UConsent coordinator, Take Back the Night co-chair and fourth-year global and feminist studies double-major Ashley Morgan said the University is “dragging their feet” in addressing students’ demands for improved sexual assault policies.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think anyone is surprised that the university has delayed putting the demands into effect, given their history of handling cases of sexual assault and their initial resistance to these ideas,” Morgan said in an email.</p>\n<p>Morgan said she is hopeful the demands will soon be implemented.</p>\n<p>“I think [administrators] are beginning to realize that by helping this forward, they are paving the way for the UCs in terms of sexual assault reform,” Morgan said in an email. “I’m hoping that this notion, along with constant pressure from those involved, will get these demands implemented within this school year.”<br>\nAccording to Melgoza, there is still a long way to go before survivors of sexual assault receive sufficient support from the University.</p>\n<p>“These are the lives of students; their power was taken away,” Melgoza said. “It’s important to acknowledge that fact and make sure those survivors are given that power again.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, October 8, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Talks Live in New York City on Nov. 2 in Town Hall Theater to discuss the “Education Revolution.”</p>\n<p>The talk will focus on reforming education curriculums in public schools to better serve marginalized, “at-promise” students. Rios said he was motivated by his personal journey in overcoming adversities to research the education systems within public schools and their effects on marginalized students.</p>\n<p>According to Rios, the T.E.D. Talk will focus on his work in developing a curriculum for high school “push-outs” who have been victimized and criminalized by schools.</p>\n<p>“They get punished overwhelmingly, they get reported to police, they get told ‘you’re not allowed in school’ because they’re truant,” Rios said. “They end up in the streets and become vulnerable.”</p>\n<p>Rios said many struggling high school students receive mostly informational support from teachers and emotional support is largely overlooked.</p>\n<p>“We just see you as a student, an empty container to be filled with knowledge, that doesn’t have anything to offer me as an educator except to sit there and take notes,” Rios said. “Right now, a lot of emotional connection is lost in the educational system.”</p>\n<p>Rios also said he wants to advocate for educational curriculum based on restorative justice rather than punishment.</p>\n<p>“The best way to teach kids a lesson when they mess up is to give them love, connection, emotional support and, of course, holding them accountable,” Rios said. “We need more restorative justice.”</p>\n<p>Last April, Rios spoke at T.E.D.xUCSB, a locally organized T.E.D. event featuring UCSB professors from various departments. In his talk, Rios said the generation currently in higher education is sometimes considered the “dumbest” and most “narcissistic,” but he does not believe this to be true.</p>\n<p>“We got it all wrong — politicians, education systems, the media,” Rios said. “In national surveys and local studies, we’re finding that your generation craves emotional connection — that your generation actually empathizes in a larger, deeper way than former generations.”</p>\n<p>Also at the T.E.D.x event, Rios said educators need to employ a more emotional method when teaching the millennial generation, as it is more focused on personal connection and social impact than generations before.</p>\n<p>“When we teach to the heart, the mind follows,” Rios said. “When we connect with [students] in an emotional way, in a compassionate way, it opens up avenues for them to learn in an academic setting.”</p>\n<p>According to Rios, presenting in New York will be an important opportunity to convey his message about education reform.</p>\n<p>“I have the potential to leave a message to the world about how we could help kids that are on the street corners lost, kids that are abused, kids that society has forgotten about, kids that have been called criminals and thugs,” Rios said.</p>\n<p>Second-year undeclared major Navid de Leede said Rios’s sociology class encouraged him to take action to improve the educational achievement gap at his old high school.</p>\n<p>“We went to Professor Rios’s office hours and asked him, because what are you gonna do with a problem that’s been ingrained for years in our specific hometown?” de Leede said.</p>\n<p>Second-year pre-biology student Anthony Lavezzo said Rios helped jump-start the educational program with de Leede at his high school.</p>\n<p>“He was more like guiding us rather than pushing his own philosophy. He gave us recognition after we developed our project,” Lavezzo said.</p>\n<p>According to de Leede, Rios spoke extensively about educational inequality against under-privileged students during his lectures.</p>\n<p>“We learned that he was very passionate about not leaving students behind because of their financial situation or their socioeconomic background,” de Leede said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 8 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65681\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65681\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/","id":2675,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[2674,2673,2672],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
