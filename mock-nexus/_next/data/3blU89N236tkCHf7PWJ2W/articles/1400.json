An aggressive first half header by junior forward Nick DePuy was all Santa Barbara needed to come away with a 1-0 win and start its season off on a great note.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“We take a lot of pride in the way we played tonight,” Vom Steeg said. “I thought we battled all the way through, we got great bench contribution. I thought that we found out a lot about ourselves tonight.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">UCSB last faced Stanford on the road in September of last season in a game in which the Gauchos conceded three goals in the first 12 minutes on their way to a 4-1 loss. With a more experienced squad this time around, UCSB was able to keep finding ways to preserve a shutout and defeat the Cardinal for the first time since 2004.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“We’ve been playing that video for our guys for about eight months and looking forward to this game,” Vom Steeg said. “The gameplan was a little more defensive all the way because I knew that we could break out on them, which we did, but the defense won tonight.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">The first 10 minutes of the game was all Stanford as the Cardinal came out aggressive and was able to put some pressure on the UCSB backline. Stanford’s best chance of the half came 20 minutes in, when sophomore midfielder Drew Skundrich was found with a chipped through ball in the box, forcing UCSB goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg off his line. Skundrich was able to get off a decent header, but the composed freshman made an outstanding leg save to keep the game scoreless.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“Justin did well. He got his first shutout and his first yellow card, so he’s got one more than I do in the season,” Vom Steeg said. “He was very clean with all the balls that came in. When you play with a goalie that the defense is confident having behind, if they have a player break through, you know Justin is going to make a play for you.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">After being subbed in with less than 16 minutes to go in the half, UCSB midfielder Seo-In Kim made an instant impact. Playing in his first regular season game with UCSB, the junior transfer from Duke used his speed to find space down the right side before sending in a slightly deflected cross towards the far post. Just as he did all last season, DePuy attacked the ball in the air and was able to power a header past Stanford junior goalkeeper Andrew Epstein to put the Gauchos up 1-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“When I came in, I knew I could make a difference,” Kim said. “Tim really talked about breaking the defense, breaking the defensive midfield line, that’s what I want to do. Just having Nick up there, you can’t really miss him, so it made my job easy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">With the goal, DePuy has now scored in six of his last seven games dating back to last season with eight goals during that stretch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Less than four minutes into the second half, Stanford thought it tied the game with a goal off a free kick into the box, but UCSB was saved by an offside call.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Much of the second half saw the Cardinal pushing men forward in search of a goal, resulting in a couple of good chances with just under 30 minutes to go. Fortunately for UCSB, a pair of Stanford shots from the edge of the 18-yard box were poorly hit, one being easily saved by Vom Steeg and the other sailing high.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">A couple of fan favorites in sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani and freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong nearly connected to put the game away midway through the final stanza. For the second time in the half, Selemani beat not one, but two defenders down the left side before finding Acheampong making a run into the box. The lefty tried to set himself up on his favored foot, making it a difficult angle for the shot, and he sent it just wide of the post.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Injuries then became an issue for UCSB as Kim, junior left back Ismaila Jome and junior midfielder Drew Murphy all required clock stoppages in order to be subbed out towards the end of the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">The Gauchos found themselves playing mainly on their defensive half for the final 10 minutes of the match. Stanford’s last good chance came with 1:09 remaining, when a cross from the left wing found Foster Langsdorf wide open in the box, but his header went wide and an exhausted UCSB defense was soon able to celebrate the impressive 1-0 win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Midfielder Kevin Feucht was perhaps the game’s best player. The sophomore transfer did all the little things, putting his body on the line to make big plays defensively before helping transition to offense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“I thought Kevin was unbelievable tonight. The back line were really relying on him to kind of pick up things in front of them,” Vom Steeg said. “He threw his body around in the middle of that park, broke up so many plays and stretched out for tackles. That’s a player that’s going to help you win a lot of games with that kind of work rate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">After missing last week’s game against Westmont due to a groin injury, defender Sam Strong was a big addition for the Gauchos at center back. The freshman looked comfortable all game, making few mistakes and winning a number of headers deep in the box.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“We just had to compete and not let them get behind us and that’s what we did,” Strong said. “My groin felt better two days ago and it was a good sign, so I knew I was going to play. I didn’t know I was going to go 90, but it felt good.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Four Gauchos picked up yellow cards on the day, including DePuy, Strong and Vom Steeg.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">“I really feel like this is a team that’s just going to get better and better,” Vom Steeg said. “What’s exciting about this group is come see us play in six weeks and I think it’ll be much better than we saw tonight, which was good enough to beat Stanford.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;

UCSB has outscored opponents 7-2 in the second half including scoring all three of their goals in the win against Idaho.</p>\n<p>Another consistent the Gauchos will hope to keep relying upon is the play of senior Amanda Ball. The forward scored two goals in the teams’ opener and now has 19 career goals in her career in just 41 games played. Ball also scored a goal in the teams 3-1 exhibition win over North Texas.</p>\n<p>Ball movement, in general, will also continue to be a factor for Santa Barbara as it held possession over Idaho 65 percent of the game and managed to have nine different Gauchos register a shot.</p>\n<p>Junior goalkeeper Brittney Rogers will also look to keep riding her hot streak after registering two saves in her first shutout win of the season.</p>\n<p>Despite coming off a loss, there is no doubt that the home Spartans are still riding high off a solid performance against a team that is nationally ranked.</p>\n<p>“They definitely are a team that comes to play and they have conceded very little to their opponents but they haven’t scored a ton so I think this one will be more of a chess match instead of a physical bout which suits us,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Trailing 1-0 for most of the match, San Jose finally scored the equalizer in the 51<sup>st</sup> minute courtesy of senior midfielder Yvette Cuellar’s first career goal. Cuellar, who is coming off an ACL tear, is regarded to be one of the team leaders for this years Spartans squad.</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper Ana Calero also played exceptional in spite of the two goals allowed in her first start of the year. As a freshman, Calero received the bulk playing time in the cage starting in 10 matches conceding 15 goals and tallying a 7-4-1 record. The sophomore had 10 saves against Santa Clara marking nearly 1/3 of her total from all of the last season.</p>\n<p>Other notable players to be wary of on the San Jose State side is senior forward Dorthe Hoppius who led the team in goals (8), shots (66), and points (21) last season as well as senior midfielder Yaritza Arista who assisted Cuellar in her goal against Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>To be a successful squad, winning on the road is a necessity. Last season away from Santa Barbara, the Gauchos struggled only tallying a 3-4-2 record, however, all three road wins were against non-conference opponents. This year, fans will get a good early look to see how the team deals with being on the road, especially when faced with a road trip as long as this one.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara takes on San Jose State at 2:30 p.m. on Sunday, August 20 at Spartan Soccer Complex. The game can be streamed on the Spartans official athletic site.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

against UC Riverside late Saturday night with the offensive-minded approach they showcased in their first conference game of the year against Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>With that mindset, Santa Barbara was able to outlast the Highlanders 3-1 to improve to 4-4-2 overall, and now 2-0 in conference play sitting atop the standings with six points. UCR falls to 0-9 on the season and 0-2 in the Big West with a last-place standing.</p>\n<p>UCSB was able to hold possession of the ball for most of the first ten minutes of the match, being able to get through the UCR defense multiple times for shots on goal that were ultimately kept out of the net. The Highlanders offense was also able to put together some runs but were denied any good looks at the goal by a Gaucho defense that showed signs of an ability to defensively recover.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>However, in the 12th minute of the match, Riverside sent a pass down the right side of the field over the UCSB defense where junior Eduardo Sanchez was able to poke the ball past Gaucho keeper Alan Carrillo, who was drawn out from his position. The capitalized opportunity for UCR gave the team an early lead, 1-0.</p>\n<p>UCSB wasted no time in trying to get an equalizer, multiple plays by freshman No. 9 Rodney Michael and sophomore No. 13 Ignacio Tellechea lead to the Gauchos being able to take good shots on goal, forcing the UC Riverside keeper Vincent Morales to make plays in front of the net.</p>\n<p>The unsuccessful scoring opportunities lead to UCSB Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg making changes in the 33rd minute, substituting No. 13 Ignacio Tellechea and No. 10 Noah Billingsley for No. 17 Derek Kryzda and No. 21 Alex Liua.</p>\n<p>The newly brought in duo of Kryzda and Liua were quickly able to maneuver the offense and create some close chances for the Gauchos. It was in the 37th minute where Liua found himself in the right place to receive a bounce off a UCR defender that went left of the box. Liua was able to perfectly send the ball over the keeper’s head and into the corner of the net to leave the game all tied up at halftime.</p>\n<p>It was in the 37th minute where Liua found himself in the right place to receive a bounce off a UCR defender that went left of the box. Liua was able to perfectly send the ball over the keeper’s head and into the corner of the net to leave the game all tied up at halftime.</p>\n<p>The beginning of the second half did not bring an end to UCSB being able to find ways through the Highlander’s defense and it was Gaucho sophomore Noah Billingsley who put UCSB out in front. The forward took a shot from the left side of the box and floated the ball over the keeper’s head and into the right corner of the net.</p>\n<p>UCR stayed in the game and would occasionally get through the UCSB defense, but the Highlanders were unable to find a way into the net throughout the second half and any shot on goal was either saved or cleared away. The Highlanders were more often finding themselves in their own end trying to prevent the game from getting too ahead of them.</p>\n<p>The defense for the Highlanders finally lapsed in the final five minutes of the game, allowing Gaucho forward Rodney Michael to run past two defenders into the right side of the box and sending a shot past the goalkeeper that was buried into the left corner of the net, allowing the game to end in a 3-1 UCSB victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB players Rodney Michael, Ignacio Tellechea, and Alex Liua continue to work well in the offense through making the correct passes and being able to finish the opportunities presented in front of the net, a great sign for a team looking to establish itself early on in the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is Thursday, October 5 at the Cal State Northridge where the Matadors will be playing the Gauchos at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78955\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-01/mens-soccer-continues-strong-offensive-showing-against-winless-highlanders/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78955\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-01/mens-soccer-continues-strong-offensive-showing-against-winless-highlanders/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-01/mens-soccer-continues-strong-offensive-showing-against-winless-highlanders/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-01/mens-soccer-continues-strong-offensive-showing-against-winless-highlanders/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-01/mens-soccer-continues-strong-offensive-showing-against-winless-highlanders/","id":1399,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1398,1397,1396],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Rides 4-Game Win Streak Into Cal State Northridge Thurs.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsUCR-170930-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsUCR-170930-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB hopes to sustain its momentum against a Cal State Northridge team that is in need of a victory.

During its undefeated stretch, UCSB has outscored its opponents 10-3.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Meanwhile, the Matadors will be trying to find their offense sooner rather than later considering they only scored one goal in the conference opening weekend.</p>\n<p>Altogether, both ends of the pitch will be meticulously planning for Thursday’s game as UCSB won’t wish to relinquish their top spot in the North Division standings and Northridge will seek its first conference win.</p>\n<p>The recent season can attest to the fact that UCSB becomes a different team for the better when conference play begins. After losing its conference opener in the 2016-17 season, UCSB went on to win six of its eight next matches (6-0-2) before its next loss. In 2015-16, the Gauchos won their first four Big West matchups.</p>\n<p>Over its two conference matchups, UCSB has already netted a total of eight goals on the season.</p>\n<p>Compared to the eight goals they scored throughout their entire 10-match non-conference schedule, the progress of this young roster is very much visible.</p>\n<p>With a current total of seven different goal scorers, the team is now led by two different players in this statistic category. Sophomore forward Ignacio Tellechea originally came onto the scene as the team’s leading goal scorer during the non-conference portion of the year. He also notched in another goal during the conference home opener against Fullerton via a beautifully curled shot from around the corner spot.</p>\n<p>Next up is freshman forward Rodney Michael, who has now scored a goal in each Big West match thus far. It was announced Monday that Michael was selected as the Big West Offensive Player of the Week. Both Tellechea and</p>\n<p>Michael currently sit at the top of the team’s scoring stats with four goals apiece, and will look to improve upon that tally come game night against CSUN.</p>\n<p>As for the Matadors, the beginning stages of the Big West season have not been very kind as they had to start off with two games on the road to finish five straight road matches. Still, Northridge is 2-1 on the year at home and will expect to turn things around once UCSB comes to town.</p>\n<p>A likely candidate to resolve CSUN’s goal scoring drought would be senior forward Emmanuel Usen Jr., who has totaled five goals for his side on the year. Also adding two assists to his name, Usen will surely be the beneficiary of most Matador targets and key to Head Coach Terry Davila’s game plan.</p>\n<p>Speaking of head coaches, much respect can be awarded to UCSB’s Tim Vom Steeg for getting his team ready in time for the conference regular season. The Gauchos are currently the only Big West team without a conference loss. Consistency will be key from here on out, and all signs point upwards for the Gauchos’ yearlong campaign and postseason aspirations.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be on the road this Thursday night, Oct. 5, to face Cal State Northridge at 7 p.m. at the Matador Soccer Field.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Oct. 5, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78996\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-rides-4-game-win-streak-into-cal-state-northridge-thurs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78996\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-rides-4-game-win-streak-into-cal-state-northridge-thurs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-rides-4-game-win-streak-into-cal-state-northridge-thurs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-rides-4-game-win-streak-into-cal-state-northridge-thurs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-rides-4-game-win-streak-into-cal-state-northridge-thurs/","id":1398,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1397,1396,1395],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
