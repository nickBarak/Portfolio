That’s not going to happen for us,” said Talia Chalhoub, a biopsychology major who will also be graduating with a certificate in technology management. “The fact that [we] can’t walk into Campbell Hall ever again … You can’t just go sit outside at Cajé anymore.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are people that I’m never going to see again,” she added. “I’m pretending that all this has given us is an extra week at home rather than taking away any time we have remaining.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chalhoub, who also has a sister graduating from San Diego State University with the class of 2020, said she hopes to return to I.V. during spring quarter. She pays nearly $1,000 a month to live in I.V., and unlike the thousands of UCSB students who lived on-campus and were given the option to sever their dorm leases, it isn’t as easy to back out for </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-ucsb-students-grapple-with-i-v-leases-after-university-strongly-recommends-moving-home/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vistans</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Chalhoub also lives in a house with 13 housemates, which she said can make it difficult to navigate the logistics of online classes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know some professors might be recording [lectures] and putting them online, in which case you could just put in your headphones and you’ll be fine anywhere. But other professors are having you log on at 9 a.m. during regular class period,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If I have a 9 a.m. and [my roommates] have 9 a.m.s and it’s a different class, are we supposed to sit in the same room? How are we supposed to participate if the sound is too loud?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chalhoub is one of thousands of UCSB students who are grappling with this unprecedented situation. The university is actively encouraging students to stay away from I.V. if they have already left for their hometowns — warning that the coronavirus can spread quickly in the packed college town — but some seniors are grappling with how to handle their last quarters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do they stay in what has now become a “ghost town,” as put by cultural anthropology major Alex Buckley, or do they return to their hometowns and say goodbye to I.V.?  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buckley, who is immunocompromised and works a full-time job while also taking classes, said she was initially excited when she found out that UCSB was transitioning to remote instruction for spring quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I thought, okay, this might be a great idea. I’m not going to have to worry about going into class. But then once it actually hit me that I wasn’t going to be able to have an actual, last quarter on campus … it made me really sad,” Buckley said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t have any time to say goodbye to anybody. Or even realize that my last day of class, last quarter, was the last class I would ever take on campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buckley said going home would be easier for her than for her peers, because her parents live in Santa Barbara. But her I.V. landlord “already told us that he’s not letting anybody out of their lease.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t have any choice but to stay [in I.V.],” she said. “I would prefer to move and get out of I.V. since there’s nothing here and nothing open anymore.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said she considered subletting but hasn’t been able to find anyone actively trying to move into I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people, instead, are trying to get out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Walking around, Isla Vista is such a ghost town,” she said. “It’s really weird and super quiet. There’s no cars on the street, everyone I know has left and it’s a super weird, eerie feeling.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For seniors who have already left for their hometowns, such as for English major Jasmine Garcia, their lives are up in the air — it’s unknown if they will be able to return to I.V. and carry out their senior traditions, or how they will handle remote classes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garcia, who transferred to UCSB in Fall Quarter 2018, said this next quarter is going to be difficult for her to manage because she won’t have access to in-person campus resources such as Campus Learning Assistance Services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[I have to] become independent and find my own ways to get my essays revised,” she said. “I’m an English major, and [this] makes me feel like I don’t have any other support at the moment.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that it felt like her life “completely froze for a second” when she found out that Spring Quarter 2020 would be conducted remotely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a transfer, this “leaves me with one and a half years [at UCSB],” Garcia said. “I miss interacting with people and finding new connections … that was the number one thing I actually enjoyed the most [at UCSB].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Garcia, UCSB senior Sierra Hastings has also returned to her hometown. But Hastings finds herself in a unique situation for her last quarter; she’s in the Bachelor of Fine Arts in Theater program, along with nine other people in her senior class — a program that is “a struggle” to teach online. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hastings said that her professor has been checking in with her class but noted that they’re “at the same kind of loss, like, ‘Oh my god, how are we going to teach theater and dance on a computer?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s going to be a different quality than what we would get from being in a classroom. From those physical corrections that you get at the barre or in your acting studio — creating shows together, creating when you are cast in a play — I’m not going to get any of that,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hastings said that while she is sad that there won’t be an in-person spring quarter, she knows these measures are meant for the better of UCSB students and the greater community — but she’ll miss the day-to-day activities that being on campus brings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All of this is a lot to take in, but at the end of the day, this is the best decision for the community and the world at large,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been really fortunate to have so many wonderful memories … [I’ll miss] the rehearsal rooms that we have on campus. I feel like those were the rooms that I’ve really grown in as a person, I’ve just learned so much about myself, about the community … I feel like I’ve really spent 3.7 years in those rehearsal rooms at theater dance.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that her nine-person senior class in the training program has been discussing possibly holding a smaller graduation just for her program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been training together for three years,” Hastings said. “Finding out we wouldn’t be together for our last quarter was heartbreaking.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

pretty, but the UCSB golf team did just enough on Wednesday’s final round of the Big West Tournament to win by one shot by the end of the day and bring the conference championship back to Santa Barbara for the first time since 1998.</p>\n<p>“It was just awesome, long time since we have won the conference so this victory is great,” Head Coach Steve Lass said. “The crowd support, public support, and really community support were really cool and to win in front of this community was even better.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos came into the last round holding a six-stroke lead, but as the day progressed, a red-hot CSUN, which fought back fiercely behind the wonderful performance of junior Felix Mory, kept cutting into that lead. By the final hole, Santa Barbara held a slim, one-stroke advantage.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Despite the pressure, sophomore Nick Swanson made sure to keep that lead, finishing the par-3 hole well, capping off a great season and bringing home a championship to Santa Barbara for the first time in nearly 20 years. Although as a team they only carded 3-over par 291 on the final day, the Gauchos’ overall 12-under 852 proved enough to secure the win.</p>\n<p>After the conference championship, UCSB is now the proud holder of five tournament victories this year, something they feel definitely made a difference when during this championship they held onto the lead and did not allow victory to slip away.</p>\n<p>“I think winning those other four [tournaments] definitely played a big factor being able to be in that position before,” Swanson said. “This wasn’t a new feeling for us, but all our other wins were more runaways and this one came down to the end so experience paid off.”</p>\n<p>By winning the Big West, the team has also secured a spot in the NCAA Regionals. The Gauchos won’t know whom they are playing or where they will play until later today, but they are certainly excited about the opportunity to play in the final competition of the season.</p>\n<p>“I don’t care where we go, I’m just excited to play wherever they send us,” Swanson said. “It’s a great feeling to finally have that final satisfaction of a conference championship and moving on.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Gauchos raising their first <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BigWestGolf\">@BigWestGolf</a> cup since 1998!

Mory came into the final round as the top individual player at Sandpiper thus far and he finished it that way, carding 10-under 206 for the whole tournament to take the title.</p>\n<p>Swanson finished the day carding 1-over par 73, but still had a great tournament overall, finishing as the highest-ranking Gaucho in the individual at third place with a 5-under par 211, just one shot behind Long Beach State’s Joe Fryer, who finished 6-under par 210.</p>\n<p>Junior Zack Smith finished in fourth place, carding 4-under par 212 for the tournament while defending champ junior Brandon Bauman dropped 11 slots by the end of after a very tough 5-over par 77 performance. He would finish tied for 15th at even-par 216. The junior was certainly proud of a team win and knew he could count on his guys to bring home the trophy despite his below-average performance.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, we have a team where all five guys could have won this tournament,” Bauman said. “Today I struggled, but I was confident my team would get it done and it’s an awesome feeling to know that if you’re having an off day, you got four guys that could play golf really well.”</p>\n<p>Willy Moffly finished tied for 24th after carding 4-over par 220 for the tournament. The junior played a pivotal role down the stretch as the lead was diminishing and came up huge for the ‘Chos, carding at least even-par in his final eight holes.</p>\n<p>The youngest of the group, freshman Brett Bennett, also stayed strong during the final round and came out of this tournament with a 17th-place finish at 1-over par 217. Despite being the youngest on the squad, it is not lost on him how important this win was not only for him but also for the program.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77575\" style=\"width: 321px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-03/ucsb-golf-claims-first-big-west-title-since-1998-clinches-spot-in-ncaa-tournament/golf_jorgemercado-05031701-web/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-77575\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77575\" data-attachment-id=\"77575\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-03/ucsb-golf-claims-first-big-west-title-since-1998-clinches-spot-in-ncaa-tournament/golf_jorgemercado-05031701-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Golf_JorgeMercado-05031701-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Golf_JorgeMercado-05031701-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Golf_JorgeMercado-05031701-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Golf_JorgeMercado-05031701-web.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-77575\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Golf_JorgeMercado-05031701-web-1024x683.jpg?resize=311%2C208\" alt=\"\" width=\"311\" height=\"208\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Golf_JorgeMercado-05031701-web.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Golf_JorgeMercado-05031701-web.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Golf_JorgeMercado-05031701-web.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Golf_JorgeMercado-05031701-web.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Golf_JorgeMercado-05031701-web.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77575\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Brett Bennett tees off at the 2017 Big West Championships. <em>Jorge Mercado / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I think this is cool, all these guys have taken me in and made it super easy for me to transition from high school to college,” Bennett said. “In my first year to go to regionals and keep playing golf with this team has me really excited.”</p>\n<p>Overall, it was a huge day for the Gauchos.
