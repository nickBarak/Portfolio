Each featured category will also have its own sub-section such as poetry, prose, drawings, paintings and sculptures, Woo said.</p>\n<p>“Um…” Magazine’s editorial team hopes to have print editions of their content by Winter Quarter 2019, according to Woo.</p>\n<p>While the magazine does plan on having consistent writers on their team, Woo said the majority of the content they wish to include will be submitted by students themselves, which will hopefully showcase students’ own personal struggles and stories.</p>\n<p>Anyone who wants to submit content will be allowed to do so, according to Woo.</p>\n<p>“The magazine would prioritize [marginalized] people… but won’t exclude anyone who wanted to submit content,” she said.</p>\n<p>“We hope to give voices to those [marginalized] groups and opinions that don’t see as much light without feeling it necessary to censor or change what they have to say regardless of who’s listening,” the magazine’s Gofundme page states.</p>\n<p>Woo’s hope is that the magazine will turn into a community rather than just a publication. They will hold fundraisers and social events, such as open mic nights, throughout the year to get more students involved and interested.</p>\n<p>A goal for the magazine is to be able to hand out their publications for free, so more people can read their content.</p>\n<p>“I think opening up people’s eyes to new perspectives will help them practice more than just tolerance… they’ll practice acceptance and to support those who don’t fit into a very one-sided perspective,” Woo said.</p>\n<p>The magazine has its own Instagram page that will keep students updated on the progress of the publication process. They have also asked students to submit their own content, which is already being featured on the page.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

#NotWorthIt campaign warns of fines, DUI checkpoints and increased police presence during Halloween.</p>\n<p>The advertisements are targeted toward “non-locals who have no affiliation with UC Santa Barbara,” according to UCSB Director of News and Media Relations Andrea Estrada.</p>\n<p>UCSB warns the public about the potential consequences of I.V. Halloween celebrations by publicizing testimonials from regretful Halloween party attendees of the past on various social media platforms, as seen in past and current advertisements.</p>\n<p>The funding for ads decreased from 2017 to 2018, according to Estrada.</p>\n<p>Halloween in 2016 and 2017 saw a significant decrease in police presence. This is part of a noticeable downward trend in the number of police in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Halloweens in 2013 and 2014 saw heavy reports of damage and arrests in I.V. as previously reported on by the Nexus.</p>\n<p>Multiple deputies will be deployed on foot this weekend to the busier streets including Del Playa Drive, Trigo Road and Sabado Tarde, according to Sergeant Daniel Calderon from the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP).</p>\n<p>In anticipation of large crowds, both IVFP and University of California Police Department (UCPD) have increased their available staff, according to Sgt. Calderon.</p>\n<p>The safety of the UCSB’s campus was also a concern this past weekend as a result of Delirium and the soccer game against California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.</p>\n<p>“We’re responsible for the security and safety of the campus, regardless of what’s going on. We are responsive to the crowds and the demeanor and the total activity that is going on,” IVFP Lieutenant Dave Millard said.</p>\n<p>Metal detectors were present at Delirium as part of the security screening at the request of the Thunderdome department.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) reported six citations for minor in possession, four for open container and two for loud music, according to a SBSO representative who attended the I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting on Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>Police issued other citations for public urination, violation of the outdoor festival ordinance and unlicensed driving. Three people were arrested for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>A total of 27 citations and eight arrests were made on Friday and Saturday, according to Kelly Hoover, SBSO spokesperson. This number includes citations and arrests made by both SBSO and the UCPD.</p>\n<p>UCPD made five arrests on campus and issued three citations. One person was medically transported for alcohol intoxication on Friday.</p>\n<p>UCPD primarily patrolled campus property and the business district and SBSO patrolled the rest of I.V. during this past weekend, according to Hoover.</p>\n<p>The numbers are similar to last year, when only 25 citations and arrests were made during Halloween weekend by both departments.</p>\n<p>The post-Halloween weekend is expected to be quiet as well. The festival ordinance, preventing loud music or noise, is in effect until Nov. 4. Parking restrictions end on Halloween.</p>\n<p>“That is lower than some typical Friday or Saturday nights in Isla Vista,” Hoover said in an email. “Thanks to everyone for making this a safe and uneventful weekend.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Attorney General, said in the meeting minutes.</p>\n<p>The External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) position was left vacant after the disqualification of EVPSA-elect Mayela Morales last spring.</p>\n<p>At the Oct. 25 meeting, Madeline Loudon, the sole candidate for the EVPSA position, argued that the threshold was unlikely to be met.</p>\n<p>Loudon was the runner-up in the Spring 2018 Election.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been campaigning on this campus for three years now and I know the feasibility of trying to get students to turnout and I know how apathetic students can be. I believe that we are not going to hit the threshold by the second date for sure,” Loudon said.</p>\n<p>In the meeting minutes, Elections Board Member Andrew Yan noted that the office would still be able to function without the External Vice President For Statewide Affairs (EVPSA).</p>\n<p>“There are mechanisms that allow the EVPSA office to continue if that position remains vacant,” Diana Collins Puente, Elections Board advisor, said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate passed a resolution over the summer to allow the duties and funds of the office to be split, stating that a bulk of the position’s duties began over the summer as opposed to Fall Quarter.</p>\n<p>At the Oct. 24 Senate meeting, Alexandra Gessesse, who has been fulfilling some of the duties of the EVPSA in her position as campaign organizing director, urged the Senate to encourage their constituents to vote.</p>\n<p>“We still haven’t met the threshold, and our office is starting to [get] our nose deep in work regarding requisition forms and things like that,” she said. “We don’t have an EVPSA, and we won’t have one for the entire year, and that’ll be really hard for our office.”</p>\n<p>“Campaign as if you were campaigning for yourself.”</p>\n<p>While Elections Board decided against halving the threshold for the time being, they are putting their efforts toward their “Get Out The Vote” campaign by setting up a voting booth at Pardall Center and a mobile voting booth on campus.</p>\n<p>They also partnered with the A.S. Ticket Office to send an email to students who purchased tickets to the annual Delirium concert put on by A.S. Program Board.</p>\n<p>Loudon did not appear to be actively campaigning by the time Elections Board held their Oct. 11 meeting and was unable to make it to the candidate forum on Oct. 5.</p>\n<p>If the minimum voting threshold is not reached, the EVPSA position will remain vacant until the Spring Quarter 2019 elections.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Nov. 3]: This article was updated to include information about the second extension of the deadline. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
