As Prof. Sweeney would tell you in his Geography of Surfing class, waves are a commodity: it’s all about scale.</p>\n<p>Most surfers know the blissful rush that accompanies a ride, the satisfaction of a big whack off the top, the feeling of being home in the strangely muted roar of a barrel. Best of all, a surfer knows the joy that comes with leaving the water after a good sesh as you strip off your wetsuit (unless you’re lucky enough to be in tropical waters), blow giant salty snot loads out your shnoz and take a moment to reflect on your waves, the water and the sun.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When your mind is in the right place, surfing provides exercise and spiritual orgasm at the same time. I can remember the best five barrels of my life. They also happen to rank among some of the best moments of my life.</p>\n<p>But it can be disappointing when you get to your feet on a decent wave and barely hint at pumping down the line—only to pull off the wave a moment later as some kook launches his polka-dotted 7’9″ hybrid twin fin straight at your dome with face-smashing, skin-splitting, tooth-knocking force. (“Oh sorry brah, was I in your way? Why were you going right? I totally thought Rincon was a left…”)</p>\n<p>So here’s my disclaimer: If you want to be a surfer, you’ve got to earn it. And that means doing your homework. Although it may look easy at times, surfing is no joke. The ocean is no joke. The animals in the ocean are no joke (I still have problems with the ‘S’ word). Big waves are no joke. Sharp fiberglass fins and pointed epoxy noses are no joke. Rip tides are no joke. Spitting barrels over dry coral reef are no joke. Necrotizing fasciitis (from coral infections) is no joke. If you want to be a surfer, you’ve got to act as a beginner of any craft or sport would: cautiously at first, and always respectful.</p>\n<p>Read Shaun Thompson’s <em>The Surfer’s Code</em>. He’s the world’s first professional surfer and he still shreds a stick better than you’ll ever be able to (locally to boot!). Memorize it. Pay attention to every rule, especially the following: “<em>I will never turn my back on the ocean.” </em>Surfers far better than you or me (R.I.P. Mark Foo, Malik Joyeux) have lost their lives to the ocean.</p>\n<p>It may take some time, but once you’ve found your footing on your board, come to understand the right of way rules in a crowd and learned to pick out the right times of day to go for a surf, you’ve probably also learned how to get your ass cussed out viciously by a local and how to avoid drowning as you simultaneously drink gallons of salt water through your nose and tumble around underwater like a Mexican jumping bean. Or at least you should have.</p>\n<p>If you are attempting to carry on surfing as a life passion, you are probably going to experience a shit-ton more dangerous, adrenaline-spiking situations in the water. And you’re probably also going to spend a gazillion hours a day fantasizing about warm water, moderate off-shore winds and empty lineups. Actually, you’re also going to spend thousands of dollars on surfboards, wetsuits, gas, plane tickets, hostels, taxis, hospitals, taco stands and surf videos in your quest for the ultimate ride, the perfect session, the hidden spot you’ve traveled the world to find.</p>\n<p>So all you wannabes, stop your itching to be able to say “gnarly” in casual conversation. The G bomb is reserved for those who have experienced the gnarly. Your day will come. Until then, I will just do my part to follow Thompson’s ninth rule: <em>I will pass on my stoke to a non-surfer.</em></p>\n<p><em>Daily Nexus</em> surf columnist Elliott Rosenfeld is shocked by how

eviction notice for the demolition of the building due to structural issues, including insect infestation, poor ventilation and structural damage that made the building highly unstable in the event of an earthquake.<em> Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Last Saturday — after nearly a year of fighting against the demolition of the building — students, community members and UCSB staff and faculty came together for the reopening of the renovated El Centro Arnulfo Casillas building.</p>\n<p>The open house celebration started with a ceremonial song and blessing by Chumash elder Marcus Lopez.</p>\n<p>“This center is to celebrate the new vision of the world that we are going to live in,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>He said the reopening shows that “tradition can break the master narrative” of historical colonial power over people of color and that the students, community and everyone involved in El Centro will redefine what the new narrative is.</p>\n<p>“I’m happy to see and to be here and to give you that message through these ancient songs,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>In commemorating the students for their work in saving El Centro, Lopez said “this is your strong hold, make it wise, make your connections with what you need to connect.”</p>\n<p>As previously <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/historic-el-centro-building-set-to-reopen/\">reported</a> in Jan. 2017, occupants of the building received a 45-day eviction notice for the demolition of the building due to structural issues, including insect infestation, poor ventilation and structural damage that made the building highly unstable in the event of an earthquake.</p>\n<p>After the eviction notice, students and alumni voiced their frustration toward the administration and continually fought for the permanency and improvement of the building, according to Shahryar Mooraj, a member of the El Centro committee and fourth-year mathematical science and physics double major.</p>\n<p>“As students, we came together to stop that and to fight for the history and the culture that has been built in that space over time and to ensure that El Centro has a permanent physical space on campus,” Mooraj said.</p>\n<p>“Keeping the doors open for those yet to come,” is written on the sign hanging over the front door entrance.</p>\n<p>The reopening ceremony commemorated past and present students and faculty that have fought for the fruition and continuation of El Centro through decades of social justice work, community resistance and grassroots organizing so future students of color can feel they have a space at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I was one of the students who lead the negotiation for the rebuilding process in the El Centro committee,” UCSB alumna Damaris Adame said.</p>\n<p>Adame said the day they were served the eviction which “essentially condemned” and made “immediate evacuation” necessary on Jan. 9, 2017, feels like “decades ago [rather] than just last year.” But it was last year when we as students were told that the temporary building 406 was essentially condemned and our immediate evacuation was necessary,” Adame said.</p>\n<p>According to Adame, they were asked to “remove the art, the decades of posters, murals and designs” that mark student protests and struggles that were born and grew out of El Centro, but they were also asked to abandon “the safety [they] had created within these four walls.”</p>\n<p>Adame said that the students El Centro carry with them, the Chicanx movement of MEChA, the hunger strikes of 1988 and 1994, and more movements uplifted them.</p>\n<p>Congressman and UCSB alumnus Salud Carbajal and Chancellor Henry T. Yang were present at the ceremony along with Ozzie Vargas, director of the Educational Opportunity Program and representatives from Counseling and Psychological Services. Many Chicano/a studies department faculty and Associated Students (A.S.) officials were also present.</p>\n<p>Event organizer, Yaneli Gutierrez, distinguished A.S. executive director, Marisela Marquez as a staff member that has been a supporter of El Centro since her time as a graduate student on campus.</p>\n<p>Marquez told the story of the day she first visited El Centro in 1988. She said “it was the first time I had exhaled in three years.”</p>\n<p>“In the early years, I watched [students] negotiate and sell M&amp;M’s to actually create the first La Raza college day,” Marquez said, referring to when El Congreso, one of El Centro’s organizations, brings high school and middle school students of color to campus to introduce them to how higher education works.</p>\n<p>Marquez said the Chicanx and Latinx student population has gone from approximately 12 percent to over 25 percent and credited El Centro as a main reason for UCSB’s effectiveness as a Hispanic Serving Institution.</p>\n<p>Marquez emphasized that past and present generations of students have created a space where future students will retain what El Centro has to offer.</p>\n<p>“Without [the students’ work] we wouldn’t be standing here. Its known that the next generation of students are right behind you and they’re taking it to heart,” Marquez said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the April 19 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82561\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/one-year-later-el-centro-reopens-its-doors/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82561\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/one-year-later-el-centro-reopens-its-doors/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/one-year-later-el-centro-reopens-its-doors/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/one-year-later-el-centro-reopens-its-doors/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/one-year-later-el-centro-reopens-its-doors/","id":2295,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2294,2293,2292],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"LeBron is No Leader","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I’m not mad at LeBron for ditching his home town.

However, the greater U.S. population cared much less as soon as he said “South Beach.” On a side note, does anyone in South Beach actually care about anything but topless sunbathing, partying at the Clevelander (ironic name, isn’t it?) or watching endless re-runs of “The Golden Girls?”</p>\n<p>In Lebron’s decision, the thumpin’ and bumpin’ nightclubs and magnetic draw of upbeat Miami beat out the home cooking of the self-proclaimed “Sixth City,” whatever the heck that means. “The Decision” does not sit comfortably with many, but in the end, it was one that LeBron had the right to make.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Because of his love and loyalty to the state of Ohio and all the people in it, I do not believe that he would have announced his decision as he did without the LRMR marketing squad squawking in his ear. However, I am not letting Bron-Bron off the hook completely, as I believe he really did want to go to Miami.</p>\n<p>As I was watching the nonstop LeBron-a-thon coverage over the past couple of weeks, a couple of things dawned on me. First, watching LeBron and the Clevelandettes prance around the basketball court doing little dances, super-duper great secret handshakes and Ashton Kutcher-style pranks suggests that LeBron just wanted to be part of the pack. </p>\n<p>He never wanted to be the leader. He thrived amid the company of others, and did his best when he was playing with not only teammates, but his friends. There is a reason he refers to his high school years as his glory days.</p>\n<p>In so many ways LeBron is a “me-first” kind of guy, as shown by his 15-minute postgame interview when he referred to himself in the third person about five times. However, on the basketball court, he often takes the opposite approach. His pass-first mentality mirrors Magic Johnson’s game more than MJ’s or (shudder) Kobe’s. LeBron’s move to Miami proves that the game is all about the fun. It’s just a bummer that LeBron the person can’t be as unselfish.</p>\n<p>I do hate comparing Kobe to LeBron, or Kobe to Jordan, or Jordan to LeBron or any combination of those three players being compared. It’s phooey. Stupid. Each player is his own player. One may have accumulated a higher assist average than the other, whereas the other had a better shooting percentage, but less rebounds, etc. No matter the statistics, the fact of the matter is that LeBron will never have that killer instinct or that unrelenting drive that kept, and continues to keep, players like Kobe and Jordan up at night.</p>\n<p>Kobe and Jordan have a combination of confidence bordering on cockiness, determination and talent to make them great, to make them want to be the leader. LeBron may have the talent, but he isn’t a leader. His move to Miami, D-Wade’s city, shows not only a reluctance to put the game on his shoulders, but a lack of desire to be in the same conversation as the other greats.</p>\n<p>In the end, LeBron wanted that burden lifted. Dwayne Wade lifts that burden. LeBron may win championships, but joining Miami was LeBron’s way of giving up the throne that could have someday been his and his alone. As a basketball fan with no vested interest in Cleveland and its sports teams, LeBron’s move to Miami is sad not just because he left behind die-hard fans for a beach party, but also because we learned who LeBron really is.</p>\n<p>Perhaps our disappointment is our own fault. Maybe we shouldn’t have tried to make a follower — albeit a really awesome one — into a leader. Even so, next season will be fun, no matter how it plays out.</p>\n<p>We learned a lot this free-agency season about the true nature of coddled sports stars, and perhaps we were reminded of the pitfalls of turning professional athletes into role models. However, we ultimately learned one thing from the whole Miami fiasco: the King has left the building.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>It is crucial for the Associated Students (A.S.) internal vice president (IVP) to be seen as a neutral and non-polarizing figure, as the IVP is responsible for leading a Senate full of students with varying views.</p>\n<p>This past year, Pimentel served as an off-campus senator, co-chaired the Senate Internal Committee and was a policy intern at the I.V. Community Services District (CSD).</p>\n<p>Pimentel’s platform is focused on the accountability of A.S. senators with an emphasis on ensuring that senators are active and effective liaisons to their BCUs.</p>\n<p>While Pimentel has experience in A.S., the resolutions he has authored have been mostly positional and not directional, which means they represent symbolic measures and not direct actions. Pimentel helped author a resolution condemning anti-Semitism and hate speech, along with a resolution condemning cyber-bullying.</p>\n<p>While the <em>Nexus </em>acknowledges the importance of positional resolutions, Pimentel’s resolutions do not involve concrete action.</p>\n<p>Pimentel’s opponent, current On-Campus Senator Steven Ho, has accomplished more directional work during his time on Senate, such as authoring a resolution to demand the resignation of the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity director and helping with the demands of undocumented students on campus through the organization Improving Dreams Equality Access And Success (I.D.E.A.S.).</p>\n<p>Ho explained the work he has done on Senate but lacked a tangible plan on how he would organize the Senate itself.</p>\n<p>Pimentel expressed plans to hold “one-on-ones” with senators to hear about their goals and plans and offer them help.</p>\n<p>He also wants to create a written contract that states the exact responsibilities of each senator and how much honoraria a senator will be docked if a responsibility is not completed as a way to hold officials accountable.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> is impressed with Pimentel’s plan to “revitalize public forums” during Senate meetings. Often, public forum can create a hostile environment for discussion of controversial topics, so a new approach might be beneficial.</p>\n<p>Pimentel hopes to expand the roles and duties of the campus visibility director to bridge the gap between A.S. and the student body.</p>\n<p>If Pimentel can successfully incorporate new accountability measures for senators and support more tangible and directional bills, we believe he will be an effective and diplomatic internal vice president.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the April 19 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82557\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/anthony-pimentel-for-internal-vice-president/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82557\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/anthony-pimentel-for-internal-vice-president/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/anthony-pimentel-for-internal-vice-president/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/anthony-pimentel-for-internal-vice-president/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/anthony-pimentel-for-internal-vice-president/","id":2296,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2295,2294,2293],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
