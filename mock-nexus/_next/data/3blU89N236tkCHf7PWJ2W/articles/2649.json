The Altares Workshop, organized by graduate student Rosie Bermudez, will give participants the opportunity to create paper flowers, framed photographs and altars for remembrance. The altars, or “altares,” are decorated tributes to the deceased made of photographs, food and other meaningful items. The Santa Barbara Bowl celebration will begin at 4 p.m. and will showcase music from contemporary Latin bands and DJs, theatre and dance performances, art installations and altars made by local organizations, schools and museums.</p>\n<p>Fifth-year environmental studies and Chican@ studies double major Carmen Mares said while Dia de los Muertos is celebrated in parts of Latin America, it is centralized in Central and Southern Mexico.</p>\n<p>“Dia de los Muertos reminds us that death is a natural part of the human life and if a form of passage to the after-life,” Mares said.</p>\n<p>According to Mares, the student-created altars will also be displayed at the Santa Barbara Casa De La Raza and UCSB Educational Opportunity Program’s “Celebracion De la Gente” event.</p>\n<p>“Altares are constructed with candles, photographs, food and items that the deceased person loved in life,” Mares said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year Chican@ studies major Nayeli Maldonado said during Dia de Los Muertos, loved ones visit cemeteries, construct altares and cook traditional dishes for the deceased.</p>\n<p>Maldonado said she began celebrating Dia de los Muertos after volunteering at the event last year.</p>\n<p>“I’ve come to realize how important it is to share it with my community and continue to pay my respects to my family members that have passed away,” Maldonado said. “It is a way to commemorate our ancestors, thank them for the wisdom they shared and keep their memory alive.”</p>\n<p>Maldonado said she was amazed by how much detail is involved in the event.</p>\n<p>“We decorate the venue, make beautiful and intricate altares, have giant calavera ‘skull’ puppets, free face painting, Aztec dancers, mariachi, art installments and much more,” Maldonado said.</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Sabrina Delgado said she has never participated in the Dia de los Muertos event and is excited to be part of the Chican@ experience.</p>\n<p>“Since I have never been to this kind of event, I am really excited to finally be able to be part of something that unifies the community through music and art to honor the dead,” Delgado said.</p>\n<p>Delgado said although her parents are Mexico natives, she did not grow up celebrating Dia de los Muertos and wants to learn more about the holiday’s significance.</p>\n<p>“My family has never celebrated this event as much as other individuals do,” Delgado said. “I am looking forward to this new experience and [to being] more in touch with my culture and [celebrating] this beautiful event with others.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Campus Advocacy Resource and Education (C.A.R.E.) will host a booth at the event where participants can make t-shirts and practice asking for consent, and attendees will have the opportunity to sign a pledge for consent culture.</p>\n<p>O’Neal said educating students on consent culture is an important first step in preventing sexual violence on campus.</p>\n<p>“Our message is to actively practice it,” O’Neal said. “One in four girls being sexually assaulted while in college does not have to be the reality.”</p>\n<p>O’Neal said the demonstration aims to define consent and promote community participation in fighting rape culture.</p>\n<p>“Consent is active confirmation about engaging in sexual activity, and our goal is to teach what that means and the consequences of rape culture, taking steps toward replacing a culture of indifference about rape and replacing it with one of actively practicing consent,” O’Neal said.</p>\n<p>Barnett said ending rape culture must begin with individuals choosing to help end rape culture rather than “shrugging it off.”</p>\n<p>“Our generation is capable of making huge change, but it starts with the individual,” Barnett said. “Society tells us not to get raped instead of not to rape, and if I can inspire people to stand up for each other and their friends, then that is one step forward.”</p>\n<p>According to Barnett, the event will call on men to participate in fighting rape culture.</p>\n<p>“Getting men engaged and holding other men accountable for sexual assault is huge,” Barnett said. “We want men to stand with us as a powerful statement to further counteract slut-shaming and victim-blaming.”</p>\n<p>O’Neal said she hopes to build on the work of other organizations such as #nowUCsb by increasing community support for consent culture.</p>\n<p>“We are now working off of that to engage students on a more grassroots level,” O’Neal said.</p>\n<p>Graduate assistant at C.A.R.E. Sasha Coles said the event will call attention to rape culture in the days leading up to Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>“People who go to the demonstration will be able to sign a pledge for consent culture, which is especially important with Halloween just around the corner,” Coles said.</p>\n<p>Coles said by promoting consent culture as a replacement for rape culture, the event will “reframe the conversations” about sexual violence prevention.</p>\n<p>“Rape culture tolerates, accepts and rationalizes rape, sexual assault and violence while mistrusting survivors,” Coles said.</p><div

Barbara’s 2015 Distinguished Alumnus and former NASA astronaut José Hernández was honored Saturday during the Dream Luncheon for his career and support for youth S.T.E.M. education in the Stockton, California area.</p>\n<p>Hernández earned a master’s degree in electrical and computer engineering from UCSB in 1986 before joining NASA, and in 2008 he was a mission specialist aboard space shuttle <em>Discovery </em>as part of Mission STS-128. Hernández spoke on the challenges of pursing a prestigious career as an immigrant and first-generation student. The luncheon raised $9,000 for the Dream Scholar Fund at UCSB, established in 2013 to aid undocumented students who come from low-income backgrounds.</p>\n<p>Hernández said he urges young people to “dream big” when choosing a career to pursue.</p>\n<p>“We have these great programs at UCSB, but really it falls on the individual to achieve their dream,” Hernández said. “You have to say, ‘I am gonna do it.’ I was rejected 11 times to NASA’s astronaut training program before I was accepted.”</p>\n<p>Hernández, who grew up in California as an immigrant, said his second grade teacher convinced his parents to remain in Stockton, California so he and his siblings could receive a stable education.</p>\n<p>“She was able to convince my parents that the nomadic lifestyle our family was living was hindering their kids’ educations,” Hernández said. “From that point on, we, for the most part, stayed in Stockton, and that helped me succeed in school and eventually reach college.”</p>\n<p>Hernández said he knew he wanted to become an astronaut in 1972 when he saw Apollo 17 on the news.</p>\n<p>“I still remember newscaster Walter Cronkite narrating the Apollo 17 mission,” Hernández said. “I was just mesmerized by astronaut Gene Cernan walking on the surface of the moon. At the moment, I was like, ‘this is what I want to be.’”</p>\n<p>Congressman from California’s 29th district and UCSB alumnus Antonio Cárdenas, who was studying electrical engineering as an undergraduate while Hernández was earning his master’s degree, also spoke at the event. Cárdenas said he and Hernández were “buddies” during their shared time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I looked up to him back then because at that time, and unfortunately still today, there were very few Latinos who were in grad school,” Cárdenas said. “To me, he is an inspiration because he went a step further with his education and his education ultimately helped prove to everybody that the sky is not the limit; he became an astronaut.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science and global studies double major Pedro Villalobos said Hernández’s story is “inspiring” as he comes from a “similar background.”</p>\n<p>“My parents were also fieldworkers. They worked on dairy farms and also as gardeners,” Villalobos said. “To see someone who was able to graduate and myself, who is just about to graduate — it was inspiring to know there are opportunities after graduation to make an impact in the world.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

and National Geographic explorer Mike Lebecki speaking at Campbell Hall about his 2012 expedition to Bertha’s Tower.</p>\n<p>Lebecki was the first person to climb Bertha’s Tower, naming the 2,000-foot granite spire after his grandmother who passed away before the expedition began. During the event, Lebecki presented photojournalist Cory Richards’ documentation of the expedition and recounted the details of climbing in below-freezing temperatures, traversing unusually sharp rocks and taking shelter from extreme wind.</p>\n<p>Lebecki said the expedition had an aura of excitement before it began due to the location and height of Bertha’s Tower, which looks like a sharp spike of rock.</p>\n<p>“This particular expedition felt like it would be the biggest one of our lives,” Lebecki said.<br>\nLebecki said the jutting rock looked like a foreign planet.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really alien landscape; we could have been looking at Mars,” Lebecki said.</p>\n<p>According to Lebecki, his team was delayed three weeks shortly after the trip began due to heavy winds ranging from 40 to 80 mph. Lebecki said when the crew finally arrived at the base of the tower, the heavy winds continued to make travel difficult.</p>\n<p>“The weather [in Antarctica], it’s raw and it’s brutal and it just beats the shit out of you,” Lebecki said.</p>\n<p>Lebecki said although the team had originally planned to travel by kite skiing, the strong winds pulled kites out of the explorers’ hands. Lebecki said the slick, wind-polished ice made hand skiing impossible, forcing the team to walk using spiked boots. The sharp rocks on Bertha’s Tower raised concerns of cut ropes if someone fell, making trust a primary requirement for the expedition, according to Lebecki.<br>\n“We were all putting our lives in somebody’s hand,” Lebecki said.</p>\n<p>According to Lebecki, the crew made camp and began preparing for their final push toward the peak after scaling 1,200 feet and placing anchors in the tower’s face. Lebecki led the final push to the summit.<br>\n“All of my experience for the last 20 years was for this moment,” Lebecki said.</p>\n<p>Lebecki said the panoramic views from the camera were breathtaking, but the team could only stay for twenty minutes before it was necessary for them to begin rappelling back down.</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Matthew Edmiston said the whole expedition was difficult to imagine.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know how he did it, how he got the rope up there; it was like a flying city, with him and his crew and his gear, I don’t know how he got it all up there,” Edmiston said.</p>\n<p>Lebecki’s mother Charlotte said she admires her son’s profession.</p>\n<p>“Every story is new to me and I just love hearing it and seeing it, especially the videos are just breathtaking,” Charlotte Lebecki said. “I am in awe of what he does, and I feel very fortunate to see what he sees.”</p>\n<p>First-year environmental studies major Marissa Rajczi said it was inspiring to hear about Lebecki’s experiences, having recently experienced the difficulty of climbing.</p>\n<p>“It was especially exciting to hear Mike’s first-hand account of his Antarctic expedition given that yesterday I went outdoor free climbing for the first time,” Rajczi said. “I could appreciate the mental and physical stamina it must have taken him to complete such a climb, and found myself in awe as I related my own experiences to his.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65776\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/national-geographic-explorer-lectures-on-2012-expedition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65776\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/national-geographic-explorer-lectures-on-2012-expedition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/national-geographic-explorer-lectures-on-2012-expedition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/national-geographic-explorer-lectures-on-2012-expedition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/national-geographic-explorer-lectures-on-2012-expedition/","id":2646,"author":{"id":148,"name":"Jacob Little"},"related":[2645,2644,2643],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
