The Hornets have given up the most goals in the conference with 27 allowed this season; a recipe for disaster when considering UCSB ranks third in the Big West with 27 goals scored this season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is coming off a 1-1 draw against UC Davis, a result that extended the Gauchos unbeaten streak to nine games and kept their conference recorded undefeated.</p>\n<p>Sac State has dropped seven of its last eight matches, accumulating only one victory in conference play. Last time out, Sac State was trounced 4-2 by Cal Poly, and although the Hornets lost, it was the first time all season they scored more than one goal in a match. The Hornets rank last in the Big West with 11 goals scored in 16 games this season.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we can get on top of them early and stay on top of them,” Vom Steeg said. “What we’re looking for is a really solid game on Wednesday where we put our defense and offense together, play a complete game and come out with a win.”</p>\n<p>With one of the highest RPI rankings in the country, the Gauchos case for postseason play beyond the conference tournament looks strong. Another victory Wednesday will only solidify UCSB’s place in the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>UCSB will however enter the game shorthanded. Freshman midfielder Paul Ehmann must sit out the contest due to accumulating five yellow cards this season. Injuries have also taken a toll on the Gauchos as senior defender Peter Schmetz is out for the near future and senior forward and leading goal scorer Achille Campion is questionable for the game.</p>\n<p>“I think every Big West game is a challenge. Out of the eight Big West games that we’ve played, I think we’ve been behind in six of them,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s not what we want to do, but we are just having to battle our way all the way until the end of the season. I just wouldn’t be surprised if Wednesday isn’t any different; we’re going to have to battle our way through Wednesday’s game, and once again, like we’ve been doing, find a way to win.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff Wednesday is scheduled for 2 p.m. at Hornet Soccer Field.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The draw ended Santa Barbara’s seven-game winning streak, but secured the North Division for the Gauchos and kept them undefeated in conference play.</p>\n<p>Davis, meanwhile, fell 1-0 to last-place Sacramento State, but still remains alive for the second qualifying spot for the Big West Tournament out of the North division.</p>\n<p>“Davis is playing to get into the playoffs and that’s what happens when you play these last few games, there’s a playoff intensity about them,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “It makes for exciting games, it makes for usually really tight games.”</p>\n<p>Last time out against the Aggies, UCSB pulled out an exciting 3-2 double overtime victory in front of a raucous Davis crowd.</p>\n<p>“All these games are going to be tight because when you are familiar with each other you start to take things away from the other team,” Vom Steeg said. “They start to get pretty familiar with what you do and we’re familiar with what they do.”</p>\n<p>Despite the familiarity, UCSB still holds an advantage over Davis, ranking third in the conference in goals scored with 26 and first in goal allowed with 15. The Aggies, meanwhile, have scored the second fewest goals with 16, but have also allowed the third fewest with 16.</p>\n<p>“[Davis] is a team that has not won a game when they have been scored on once,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re comfortable coming back from being behind. They are undefeated after being ahead in the game and they have not won when they have fallen behind.”</p>\n<p>Ranked No. 7 in the RPI rankings, UCSB is seemingly in good position to clinch an NCAA appearance regardless of the results of the Big West Tournament. Santa Barbara, however, can strongly improve its standing if it can complete a historic undefeated conference schedule.</p>\n<p>“The key for us is we’re playing for what happens after the Big West,” Vom Steeg said. “We feel good about what’s going to happen over the next three games and where we stand, but the reality is it’s the conference tournament champion who gets the automatic selection. We need to be in a position where win or lose the conference tournament, we know we’re in the NCAA tournament.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff against UC Davis is scheduled for 7 p.m Saturday night at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 31, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52711\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/gauchos-host-davis-with-chance-to-clinch-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52711\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/gauchos-host-davis-with-chance-to-clinch-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/gauchos-host-davis-with-chance-to-clinch-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/gauchos-host-davis-with-chance-to-clinch-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/gauchos-host-davis-with-chance-to-clinch-big-west/","id":1587,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1586,1585,1584],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Powerful Bond Between Teammates","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10.4.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-33.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10.4.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-33.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"During a Breakout Season, Beth Ritter Used Injured Teammate Makenna Henry as Inspiration","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Not many people saw the UCSB women’s soccer team’s season going the way it did this year — not just because of the significant improvement by the team as a whole, getting its most wins in a season since 2009 — but also because of the big shoes filled by the smallest player on the field.</p>\n<p>Listed at 5’4’’, sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter does not possess the height typical of a goalkeeper.

In fact, going back to last season, the two have shared a common bond with one another.</p>\n<p>In Ritter’s first year, she sat out the entire year as a redshirt freshman recovering from knee surgery. Before that, Ritter did not play in her final two years in high school because of knee injuries suffered before. With five knee surgeries in total, Ritter did not know if she would ever step onto the field again.</p>\n<p>“It was hard in college to watch my team play and not really be a part of it other than just a cheerleading aspect,” Ritter said.</p>\n<p>While Ritter was recovering during her first year, Henry suffered a right knee injury during a pre-conference game that severely limited her abilities. Henry toughened out the injury for the entire season even though she was forced to play with a knee brace.</p>\n<p>That knee brace brought with it its challenges: a reduction in her mobility, agility and even how she kicked the ball. Yet, one player was always there for Henry the entire season despite all the hard times.</p>\n<p>“I was struggling to get through season, [but Beth] was helping me all the way through, giving me little pick-me-ups here and there,” Henry said. “It was nice getting through a training session with someone who knew exactly what the struggles were.”</p>\n<p>Ritter knew exactly what those struggles were considering she had been dealing with knee injuries since high school and still at UCSB. For Ritter, her first year playing with Makenna was more than just learning and getting healthy; it was the start of her becoming a soccer player again.</p>\n<p>“[Makenna] used to bring me out when I was injured and work with me even if I couldn’t run, if I couldn’t dive,” Ritter said. “She would kick balls to my hand when no one else even acknowledged that I was on the team. She really set me up for the opportunity to start playing.”</p>\n<p>Flash-forward to this year and a fully healthy Ritter is able to finally play soccer for the first time in years, making her UCSB debut in the second game of the season against Weber State in a 1-1 draw.</p>\n<p>What she originally thought was going to be a year of cheerleading on the bench suddenly became a lot more when Henry could no longer go on playing injured.</p>\n<p>In her first game taking over for Henry versus Pacific University, Ritter had to deal with the usual nervousness, but instead of concentrating on herself, Ritter kept one person in mind the entire time.</p>\n<p>“What was really going through my mind was don’t let [Makenna] down. You’re playing for her right now,” Ritter said. “That’s all I needed to tell myself, play for Makenna, because as long as you focus on that, you’re not going to worry about yourself and worry about your decisions. I knew she would be proud of me if I played well.”</p>\n<p>Not only did UCSB win that game in overtime 1-0, Ritter was correct in making Henry proud of her when she revealed what she was thinking about during the game to Henry.</p>\n<p>“She actually did reveal that to me in one of our talks that we always have after our practices,” Henry said. “It’s a really huge honor to hear that from someone you respect as a person and as a goalkeeper. When she told me that, I was at a loss for words.”</p>\n<p>From that game on, Ritter showed what she was capable of accomplishing when fully healthy. Stepping in for Henry, Ritter had one of the best seasons by a UCSB goalkeeper ever recorded. At one point in the season Ritter had five straight shutouts, ending the season with the most in the Big West with eight and coming in second in save percentage at .826.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Ritter is quick to point out that it would not have been possible without her defenders and what she learned from Henry.</p>\n<p>“She took the time after practice to tell me how she always carries me with her out in the field,” Henry said. “Whatever influence I’ve had on her, either leading by example on and off the field, it was really cool to see her succeed like that and to know I had some positive effect on her success.”</p>\n<p>With Ritter now taking over the reins for UCSB, she remains as motivated as ever and does not take for granted any moment she is on the field, considering the years she spent off it.</p>\n<p>“In this weird way our injuries kept us closer together because we understood the challenges that came with being injured,” Henry said. “We were able to be each other’s support system and each other’s confidants.”</p>\n<p>If there ever was a case of injuries bringing a stroke of serendipity with it, look no further than Makenna Henry and Beth Ritter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of November 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52831\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/the-powerful-bond-between-teammates/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52831\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/the-powerful-bond-between-teammates/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/the-powerful-bond-between-teammates/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/the-powerful-bond-between-teammates/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/the-powerful-bond-between-teammates/","id":1589,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1588,1587,1586],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels to Davis With Postseason on the Line","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB's postseason hopes are on the line against Davis.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>One game holds the fate of the UCSB women’s soccer team.

We have to get a result if we want to continue,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “One of our goals all year has been to get to the Big West Tournament; clearly the only shot is to get a result, to get a win.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have overcome their recent injuries to remain in contention this late into the conference season. In its last game, UCSB played without as many as seven starters, including freshman defender Sydney Fuertes. Fuertes had previously started all games in the season before her injury.</p>\n<p>Filling in the gap on defense left by Fuertes has been freshman Kailey Hackett and sophomore Savannah Francis. Despite the inexperience of both players, they have been helped by the experience of senior defender Taylor Gehring, junior midfielder Miranda Cornejo and sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter. The trio has helped UCSB to the second best goals against average in the league (0.86).</p>\n<p>“The team has only conceded 16 goals out of 18 games,” Stumpf said. “I would say those three specifically have kept us in more games more than anything.”</p>\n<p>Against UC Davis, the Gauchos will have a favorable matchup on defense considering the Aggies have a conference-low 13 goals scored in the entire year and have been shutout on six occasions on the year. Yet, the Gauchos will have to deal with UCD having home-field advantage.</p>\n<p>“There are no easy teams out there; it’s going to be tough. They have a system we like playing against, so some people are going to have to step up,” Stumpf said. “We’re still going to have to defend as well as we have in the first 18 games of the year.”</p>\n<p>On offense, UCSB is led by senior forward Allie Ariniello and junior midfielder Madison Beckley; each are tied with a team-high five goals. Ariniello uses her size to overwhelm her opponents and has been the clinical finisher on the team.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Beckley has been the spark off the bench, contributing with three assists as well. Together, they have put UCSB in third in league with 21 goals.</p>\n<p>Kick-off for Sunday’s game is scheduled at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 31, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52713\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/ucsb-travels-to-davis-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52713\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/ucsb-travels-to-davis-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/ucsb-travels-to-davis-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/ucsb-travels-to-davis-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/ucsb-travels-to-davis-with-postseason-on-the-line/","id":1588,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1587,1586,1585],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
