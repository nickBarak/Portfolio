The California native has been on fire, having scored five goals and 11 points, both second-best marks on the team, over the last nine games. She scored the team’s only goal against CSUN, resulting in the 1-1 tie.</p>\n<p>Along with the freshman, the Gauchos will also hope for the reemergence of senior Amanda Ball.</p>\n<p>The forward started the season hot with eight goals in the team’s first 10 matches of the season, but she has fallen flat over the last five game, having not scored and being held to just two assists.</p>\n<p>Defenses have definitely been heavily pressuring the Chino Hills native.</p>\n<p>Before her five-game non-scoring streak, she had kicked one through the back of the net in four consecutive outings.</p>\n<p>Even with that, Ball’s eight goals still earns her the top spot in the Big West, along with her 18 total points. She will need to be at the top of her game against a Hawaii squad that isn’t playing great but is still capable.</p>\n<p>Last week, the Rainbow Wahine played Big West best UC Irvine and lost 3-2, meaning they won’t be such an easy win if the Gauchos don’t come out firing.</p>\n<p>Hawaii will hope to rely on leading scorer Sonest Furtado. The senior forward also leads the team in points (11) and assists (3).</p>\n<p>In reality, if Hawaii hopes for an upset win over Santa Barbara, then it will need to come out strong and fast.</p>\n<p>So far this season the Rainbow Wahine outscored 8-3 in first halves and have been shut out in six of their 13 total games.</p>\n<p>The team will need to rely upon Furtado, but she will also need help from whoever can provide it on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>Wahine goalkeeper Alexis Mata has been one bright spot on a defense that has given up 17 goals this season.</p>\n<p>The junior’s 60 saves rank second best in the Big West, while her 78 percent save rate ranks fourth.</p>\n<p>After Hawaii, the Gauchos come back home with a tough test against Long Beach State, a team that has bested UCSB in its last seven meetings.</p>\n<p>LBSU defeated Hawaii in its conference opener 2-0 but has since struggled, earning a tie with rival UC Irvine and being knocked off by CSUF at home, where it had only lost once this season before, 2-0.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Gauchos, whose top goal scorers rank way above the rest of the team, the Beach has scored 16 goals on the season, but no one player has scored more than three individually.</p>\n<p>In fact, only one, senior forward Tori Bolden, has three nets this season while the next five players have two goals apiece.</p>\n<p>This has played to the Beach’s advantage, as it has consistently found the back of the net in games, being shut out in just four contests this year, including a match against No. 18 California.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, this week has become the most critical for UCSB.</p>\n<p>A slow start is not a killer, but if it bleeds into the middle of the season, then Santa Barbara has no hope of making the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>With three of UCSB’s key players being seniors, chances are they will try everything they can to right the ship and go out on top in their final season.<br>\nSanta Barbara takes on Hawaii at 10 p.m. PST on Thursday, Oct. 12, at Waipi’o Peninsula Soccer Stadium. It will then host LBSU at 1 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 15, at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Oct. 12, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

A team stacked with 18 returning upper classmen, the Gauchos are ready for the challenge and look to take it to their conference opponents.</p>\n<p>“Passion, accountability, and commitment,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said when asked what the core values of his women’s soccer team are. Heading into his 17<sup>th</sup> season at UCSB, Stumpf could not be more excited for this young talented crew and their chances in the Big West this year.</p>\n<p>With a tough non-conference schedule lined up and Big West competition around the corner, Stumpf believes his team’s values will be the key to their success this season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I feel like this team is going to be defined by [these traits]”, Stumpf said. “Our team chemistry has exceeded others in the past couple years and the quality of our soccer is good enough to win games.”</p>\n<p>After losing two consecutive games on the road at Saint Mary’s and USF, Stumpf does not see UCSB’s 0-2 start as a signal of a losing year.</p>\n<p>“We completely dominated possession and shots in our first game and we lost two to nothing. I don’t expect that to happen in the future,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Despite being held scoreless in their last two defeats, the Gauchos have worked out their kinks in practice and are using their losses as motivation for their matchup against San Jose State this Friday.</p>\n<p>“One thing to take out of those losses is we didn’t score a goal in 180 minutes,” Stumpf said. “We’re facing a very good San Jose State team and this is going to be a game where we will get a few opportunities at the box. We’re looking for someone who can come up with one special moment in front of the goal.”</p>\n<p>The Spartans head into Harder Stadium with a 1-1 overall record. Although SJSU is a non-conference opponent, Stumpf believes these matches are exactly what UCSB needs in preparation for the team’s in-conference games.</p>\n<p>“We felt like getting a diverse group of coaching styles in the non-conference would help us with all the different styles we are going to see in the Big West,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>As far as players on the team, Stumpf anticipates an identity to be established in the front line, especially from sophomore forward Amanda Ball.</p>\n<p>“Amanda has some great athleticism to her and is a very explosive player,” Stumpf said. “She’s had a couple lingering injuries that hindered her training, but we’re slowly but surely opening up her minutes and making her game fit.”</p>\n<p>As a freshman, Ball stepped up and started seven games for the Gauchos scoring two game-winning goals. She was the offensive anchor last Sunday, breaking down USF defenders and taking four of the Gauchos’ five shot attempts.</p>\n<p>Other notables include junior midfielder Sara Feder and senior forward Angelisa Cortez.</p>\n<p>Coming off a knee injury her sophomore year, Feder hit the ground running during her redshirt season starting 15 matches for the Gauchos and scoring a team-high five goals. The Colorado native earned recognition for her play by earning Honorable Mention All-Big West honors.</p>\n<p>In her final season in a blue and gold uniform, Cortez hopes her impressive play from last season can carry on to the field this year. Cortez tied for a team-high five goals and 13 points in her junior year.</p>\n<p>UCSB will host its first non-conference game in Harder Stadium against San Jose State this Friday, August 28th. Tip off begins at 5 p.m. so make sure to cheer on our women’s soccer team as it hopes to earn its first victory of the 2015 season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64591\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/ucsb-determined-to-end-winning-drought/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64591\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/ucsb-determined-to-end-winning-drought/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/ucsb-determined-to-end-winning-drought/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/ucsb-determined-to-end-winning-drought/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/ucsb-determined-to-end-winning-drought/","id":1524,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1523,1522,1521],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Triumph at Harder: Gauchos Upset by UCR in First Round","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-11-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/HallieBrown_MSoc_vsCalPoly-20171014-16-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/HallieBrown_MSoc_vsCalPoly-20171014-16-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"When all was said and done, the UCSB men's soccer team could really only blame itself following its loss to UCR Wednesday night.

The score was by UC Riverside’s Eduardo Sanchez, and it ultimately granted the Highlanders a 1-0 first round victory that eliminated the Gauchos from their postseason aspirations.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It was a tough 90 minutes of regulation to watch, and the final three minutes were even harder. After a game that was mostly dominated by a Gaucho offense, the Highlander defense proved too stingy to allow any more than several shots on goal.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, no Gaucho attempts hit the back of the net and all Riverside needed was one in order to shock their opponents; and that they did as their window of opportunity presented itself in the 87<sup>th</sup> minute of play.</p>\n<p>Thus, the men’s soccer season has now come to a conclusion. Besides a foul ridden game and countless rotational substitutions, not much went for either team throughout the entire match.</p>\n<p>The first save of the night came fairly early as Gaucho freshman forward Sahid Conteh landed a sweeping shot that was covered by Highlander goalkeeper Vincent Morales. UCSB’s following shot was even closer than the previous as a well placed header by midfielder Joseph Ammer collided with the post in the 13<sup>th</sup> minute. For the rest of the first half the Gauchos dominated the majority of possession, but without another key opportunity it remained quiet and scoreless.</p>\n<p>Following the second whistle signaling the second half start, a combined 19 substitutions were made during play as both head coaches sought after any switch that may tip the balance of the game in their favor. Soon after, it was Sanchez’ score that sent UCSB’s ‘Soccer Heaven’ into a state of shock as the Gauchos fell victim to an early round exit.</p>\n<p>Harder Stadium was gloomy as the game-winning goal took the breath out of everyone and the final whistle sounded. Exhausted Gaucho players fell on top of the pitch as the Highlanders celebrated their biggest upset of the year.</p>\n<p>The severity of the loss was evident as Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg spoke to his team on the field rather than in the locker room.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had a trying and challenging season with lots of issues, going all the way back to Kevin [Feucht] getting hurt … so we’ve been playing catch up all year,” he said. “We went the first six games scoring three goals, the first three games scoring no goals, and ironically we ended the season just how we started it.”</p>\n<p>The coach’s words rang true as the Gauchos lack of offense decided not only the result of the postseason match, but several others throughout the year. Regardless of controlling the rhythm of games and minimizing opponents’ time of possession, the Gauchos just seemed to be missing that playmaking ability in the final third of their season.</p>\n<p>“Tonight, we were getting close but frankly I got nothing from my bench tonight. No one came off the bench tonight and helped us, and that was my biggest disappointment,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ head coach would then go on and mention the importance of finding some bench production within their current 27-man roster. Altogether, hopes still remain high for this young and very talented UCSB roster.</p>\n<p>Perhaps in the offseason, the team will work on adding the playmakers required in order to add to their future season’s total goal tally. For now, the Gauchos must put this loss behind them and focus on developing their star underclassmen as they shape the future of the UCSB men’s soccer program.</p><div

Then, in 2010, one of the greatest goalscorers of our time in former French national and Arsenal legend Thierry Henry followed in Beckham’s footsteps by leaving Lionel Messi and FC Barcelona to play for the New York Red Bulls.</p>\n<p>In more recent days, there has been an eruption of stunning moves. Coinciding with the United States’ increased fan interest in soccer (thanks for making such a great videogame, FIFA), we’ve seen American nationals Clint Dempsey, Michael Bradley, Jozy Altidore, Jermaine Jones and Mix Diskerud all make the move back to home soil. Former FIFA World Player of the Year Kaká, Chelsea legend Didier Drogba, and Italy’s Sebastian Giovinco are just a few more of the big names that have joined the league in the past year.</p>\n<p>And you can’t forget Los Angeles’ very own Giovani dos Santos of the Mexican national team, who has been absolutely killing it for the Galaxy.</p>\n<p>Back to the game. It was evident even in pregame warm-ups who the best players on the pitch were, with Pirlo and Villa in a class all on their own. However, that didn’t stop a Galaxy side that has played together for some time from absolutely dominating the last 75 minutes.</p>\n<p>Pirlo looked like a parent playing with his kid’s youth team. Every time he touched the ball it was magnificent. He seemed to always find the right man, with one-touch passes finding their mark nearly every time.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, he didn’t have much help, and the game quickly fell out of his and a frustrated Villa’s hands as dos Santos, Gerrard and reigning MLS MVP Robbie Keane celebrated goals for most of the second half.</p>\n<p>Still, when Pirlo was subbed out late in the second half, he received a heartwarming standing ovation from a Los Angeles crowd that was happy just to be able to witness firsthand his incredible talent. Villa capped his day off by scoring a classy, well-deserved penalty, making the final score 5-1 and improving his mark to 15 goals in 22 appearances for NYC.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the all-important question: what is it about MLS that is enticing enough for these players to make the move across the Atlantic, where the sport they’ve called football their entire lives doesn’t even go by the same name anymore?</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64502\" style=\"width: 231px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"789174628\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64497\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64502\" data-attachment-id=\"64502\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-24/la-vs-nyc-british-invasion-symbolizes-new-era-and-rise-of-mls/image-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?fit=620%2C350&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"620,350\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?fit=620%2C350&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64502 \" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?resize=221%2C125\" alt=\"image\" width=\"221\" height=\"125\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?w=620&amp;ssl=1 620w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image2.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64502\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">David Villa (right) is Spain’s all-time leading goalscorer (59 goals) / Photo courtesy of mlssoccer.com</p></div>\n<p>Well, for one, as is evidenced by Villa’s high goalscoring rate and the fact that the Galaxy have tallied four or more goals in five of their last 10 league games, the defending in MLS is not quite at the same level as it is in Europe. Aging stars who can no longer easily beat the younger, defensive studs that Europe has to offer can find solace knowing that they can still make a significant impact over here. This goes hand-in-hand with the tendencies of American crowds to be number-centric, awarding praise to those who are able to provide objective, statistical truths as to why they are the best rather than through actual observation.</p>\n<p>Another key factor is the absence of relegation in MLS. While in top leagues such as La Liga and the English Premier League teams finishing in the bottom three spots of the standings are moved down to a lower division the following season, MLS teams can simply look to rebuild and start fresh after a disappointing campaign. This takes away from the stress that players in Europe feel every year about playing for a club that might not even be in the same league they signed up for in a few months.</p>\n<p>And, despite the negative connotation America holds in many parts of the world, players who have played overseas their entire lives can get a ticket not only to live in a country as great as the U.S., but to play the sport they love and get paid top dollar doing it. Not to mention, even if a player is at an away game, he’ll still most likely receive more praise than hate – the fans are happy enough to be able to see them play at all. Also, people like being praised.</p>\n<p>The most important thing that MLS provides these players though, as Steven Gerrard has <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2015/01/07/steven-gerrard-im-leaving-liverpool-for-la-galaxy-to-win-trophies-5012612/\">made clear ever since he decided to play for LA</a>, is the chance to compete for something that matters.</p>\n<p>Now more than ever in the U.S., soccer is important. Everywhere you go, people are more interested and more knowledgeable in the sport than they ever have been. The USWNT just won the World Cup, and it made record-breaking viewership numbers in doing so. FIFA is the best-selling videogame franchise in the world of sports.</p>\n<p>The talent levels and competition, the viewership and overall interest, the amount of monetary investment, and the overall perception of MLS and U.S. soccer are all on the rise. The league just made the jump from 18 teams to 20 this past season and has plans to add at least four more franchises in the coming years.</p>\n<p>It takes money to make anything happen, especially in an underdog league. Luckily, ownership in MLS has shown an increased willingness to spend. NYCFC itself is owned by Manchester City, perhaps the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes%27_list_of_the_most_valuable_football_clubs\">highest roller</a> in the Premier League at this point.</p>\n<p>Looking at where MLS was back in 2007 – when David Beckham announced he was moving to LA – to where it is now, the future is as bright as ever. The more teams start reeling in big names and improving the level of competition, the more that soccer culture in America will only continue to rise.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64497\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-24/la-vs-nyc-british-invasion-symbolizes-new-era-and-rise-of-mls/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64497\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-24/la-vs-nyc-british-invasion-symbolizes-new-era-and-rise-of-mls/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-24/la-vs-nyc-british-invasion-symbolizes-new-era-and-rise-of-mls/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-24/la-vs-nyc-british-invasion-symbolizes-new-era-and-rise-of-mls/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-24/la-vs-nyc-british-invasion-symbolizes-new-era-and-rise-of-mls/","id":1525,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1524,1523,1522],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
