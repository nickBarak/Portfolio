Goodell could have taken matters into his own hands and penalized Rice from the beginning.</p>\n<p>Instead, he opted suspending the Baltimore Raven for only two games, and not until video of Rice knocking out his fiancée was released for public viewing — creating a media firestorm and causing the league to lose sponsors — did Goodell take serious action.</p>\n<p>Then, a serious of other domestic violence cases surrounding more NFL players came to light and the league found itself in a public image crisis.</p>\n<p>Rice’s situation was only the tip of the iceberg. Early into the season, Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson was indicted for reckless or negligent injury to a child, that child being his four-year-old son. The child suffered from cuts, lacerations and bruises. He told authorities, “There are a lot of belts in Daddy’s closet.”</p>\n<p>What should have been a year in which we saw if the Seahawks could repeat and watched J.J. Watt dominate opposing teams, has been overcast by player conduct off the field.</p>\n<p>But the NFL wasn’t the only league this year to shy away from scandal. In April, recorded audio of Clippers owner Donald Sterling making racist remarks was released, causing outcry from fans, players and other people within the league.</p>\n<p>Unlike Goodell, new NBA commissioner Adam Silver realized the gravity of Sterling’s remarks and took the appropriate action against him, banning the owner from the league for life.</p>\n<p>That’s what separates the two commissioners. One is concerned solely with profits, while the other is aware of his league’s place in society and is taking a stance for what is right.</p>\n<p>Despite controversy off the field, there were truly inspirational moments that reinforced why we love sports so much. Take for instance Mo’ne Davis, a Little League pitcher from Philadelphia who became the first girl to throw a shutout in the Little League World Series. Her New Year’s resolution: keep on throwing like a girl.</p>\n<p>Or how about Derek Jeter’s final farewell at Yankee Stadium. The 20-year veteran ended his legendary career with a game-winning hit in the bottom of the ninth inning. At that moment, one play captured the essence of a brilliant career.</p>\n<p>In Division III women’s college basketball, freshman Lauren Hill was diagnosed with brain cancer after committing to play for Mount St. Joseph in Cincinnati.</p>\n<p>With only a few months left to play, the NCAA decided to reschedule MSJ’s home opener so Hill could play. She had four points and said during the game, “Let’s not call this my last game. This is my first collegiate game.”</p>\n<p>So sports fans, although this might not have been the best year, keep in mind that for every league embarrassment there are a thousand more stories like Lauren Hill’s, and that’s what keeps us coming back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of December 4, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

question on everyone’s mind heading into Sunday is whether Tom Brady will show up or if he’ll pull a “Peyton” against this well respected defense. Coincidentally enough, it seems that the only time this HOF quarterback doesn’t show up for the February bowl game is when he is playing against the other Manning, and luckily for him, he isn’t this time. Instead, he will be taking on a much tougher opponent in the Legion of Boom.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor, Earl Thomas and Byron Maxwell have had their share of chances to beat up offenses this season. What makes these players so special is the fact that every one of them is capable of being the best defensive player on the field in any given game.</p>\n<p>This secondary is easily the best in football, but they have experienced some hiccups along the road. Where they seem to struggle is on the long balls, but luckily for them, that is something that Brady does not do very often. What the Legion of Boom covers best is any pass that’s in front of them, so if they can do what they do best for just one more game, they will add back-to-back champs to their résumé.</p>\n<p>We have seen the Seahawks tear apart limb from limb every elite quarterback with the exception of one: Thomas Edward Brady. This man is going into his sixth Bowl with the same franchise and head coach he’s had his whole career, and I highly doubt that he is looking to lose his third straight.</p>\n<p>If there is anyone in this league that can break up this strong defense, then it is definitely Brady. Unfortunately, the Patriots have just about the worst receiving core in the league besides Seattle, which doesn’t give him many options besides tight end Rob Gronkowski, his best receiver.</p>\n<p>Regardless of having nobody to pass to except Brandon Lafell and Danny Amendola, this QB has still gotten his usual passing number and has once again taken his offense to the last game of the season.  He has defeated top passing defenses this year like Cincinnati, Denver, Indianapolis and Buffalo twice. Rumors have it that injuries may affect both Sherman and Thomas and it is almost a guarantee that Brady will look to expose them on Sunday. It takes a madman to bet against this QB/Head Coaching duo.</p>\n<p>Defenses do win championships, but legendary players conquer all.</p>\n<p>Advantage: Patriots</p>\n<p><strong>Russell Wilson vs. Patriots Secondary</strong> by Sean White</p>\n<p>After an undoubtedly heroic performance in the Seattle Seahawks’ triumphant 28-22 comeback win over the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship, quarterback Russell Wilson is just one win away from leading his team to another Super Bowl victory.</p>\n<p>But he must first find a way to surpass a New England Patriots secondary that has been playing lockdown defense since the postseason began. In just two playoff games, the Patriots have a total of four interceptions and even held the Indianapolis Colts’ quarterback Andrew Luck to just 126 passing yards in the AFC Championship.</p>\n<p>With arguably one of the best cornerbacks in the NFL in Darrelle Revis, the Patriots automatically have an advantage coming into Sunday’s matchup. His ability to isolate and remove wide receivers from games by placing them on “Revis Island” can take away from a quarterback’s passing.</p>\n<p>Additionally, former Seahawk and “Legion of Boom” member Brandon Browner may be able to inform New England’s secondary with some insight on how to contain Russell Wilson.</p>\n<p>Although the Patriots may be able to limit Wilson’s amount of pass completions, they must be able to stop him outside of the pocket. His capability to scramble and make plays under pressure may be the most underrated aspect of this game. Wilson’s dual-threat skill set is what will allow the Seahawks to repeat as NFL champions. Expect a Seattle win as he proves yet again why he is so “DangerRuss.”</p>\n<p>Advantage: Seahawks</p>\n<p><strong>Bill Belichick vs. Pete Carroll</strong> by Sarah Stigers</p>\n<p>Trying to debate whether Bill Belichick or Pete Carroll will fare better in the Super Bowl is much like debating which is the lesser of two evils in my book, because if you are not a Patriots or Seahawks fan, you probably are not too fond of either team.</p>\n<p>However, putting personal preferences aside, these two teams got to the Super Bowl because they rely on those two evils — and ultimately, it was coaching that elevated both teams to Championship level.</p>\n<p>Let’s start this off by saying my money is on the Seahawks. Pete Carroll and the gang are coming off of an emotional victory over the Packers in the NFC Championship game. I think that any team will have a hard time upsetting that game flow, but I think if someone is going to give it a shot, it is going to be Belichick.</p>\n<p>Based on pure statistics in the NFL, there’s no questioning that the football genius that lies within Belichick’s brain is incredible, with three Super Bowl titles, six conference championships and 14 divisional championships. None of that, however, discredits the decoration Carroll received while he ran the USC empire.</p>\n<p>Carroll had nine years coaching in college football and emerged from his legacy with a .836 win percentage, on top of a 7-2 Bowl game record. Ignoring his short stint with, ironically, the Patriots in the late 90s, since his re-entry into the NFL in 2010, he already has one Super Bowl title with the Legion of Boom.</p>\n<p>I think the deeper team going into Sunday is the Patriots, and it is obvious that Belichick knows exactly how to play his stars in every aspect that he can. Belichick is no stranger to a strong defense, and he runs a tight special teams. Those two aspects are what win Super Bowls.</p>\n<p>It is very rare that a team can win two straight titles, and when it comes down to coaching, Carroll is a man that craves a legacy no matter where it takes him, whereas Belichick is a coach that will stick to his team.</p>\n<p>Where usually the latter mindset is what drives a team to be a cohesive and well-oiled machine, in this situation, I think the Pats know that this Super Bowl is not the end for them. They still have the legs to go for a few more years. Quarterback Tom Brady is a monster and Gronkowsi’s youth keeps the team fresh. The Patriots will simply not stop being good after this game.</p>\n<p>Though I cannot say this with certainty, I truly believe that same statement does not go for the Seahawks. This Super Bowl is Seattle’s chance of going down in history. I think Carroll will chase that dream through Sunday night and do everything it takes to achieve that goal.</p>\n<p>Advantage: Seahawks</p>\n<p><strong>Marshawn Lynch vs. Patriots Run Defense</strong> by Martin Cobos</p>\n<p>Marshawn Lynch may be a man of few words, but his polarizing running style has been the topic of conversation since he entered the league in 2007.</p>\n<p>“Beast Mode,” as he is known around Seattle, has perfected the art of letting his performance do the talking. So in true Marshawn fashion, we shall leave the hype alone and simply let statistics tell the story.</p>\n<p>Lynch is widely known as one of the most powerful running backs in the game today and for good reason. This season, he broke an NFL leading 109 tackles. Compare this to DeMarco Murray who finished in second place with 38 fewer broken tackles despite 117 more attempts.</p>\n<p>This bruising style of running helped Lynch lead the league in yards up the the middle this season. When Lynch is able to get at least 20 carries or break off a 20-yard run, the Seahawks are 24 games over .500. When neither of these instances occurs, the Seahawks are a mere one game over .500.</p>\n<p>On the opposite side of the ball, the Patriots have vastly improved their run defense this season. In 2013, the Patriots allowed a staggering 134.1 rushing yards per game, which ranked 30th in the league.</p>\n<p>This year, however, they rank in the top ten of the league, allowing just 104.3 rushing yards per game. The Patriots have carried their tough run defense into the playoffs as they have allowed only one rushing touchdown and have not let an opponent break off a 20-yard run this postseason. The Seahawks surely hold the advantage in this matchup with one of the most prolific running backs in the game, but the Patriots’ enhanced run defense will not go down without a fight.</p>\n<p>Advantage: Seahawks</p>\n<p><strong>Rob Gronkowski vs. Kam Chancellor</strong> by Mark Salay</p>\n<p>Tight end Rob Gronkowski is the Patriots’ biggest threat in the passing game and the amount of times New England can get him involved will be critical for the passing game. Gronkowski is such a big, physical player (6’6”, 265 lbs.), he uses his frame to beat defenders to the ball.</p>\n<p>Seattle’s strong safety Kam Chancellor, however, matches up well with Gronk and will be the one in charge of containing him. Chancellor, listed at 6’3”, 232 lbs., is just as physical and big to keep up with the tight end.</p>\n<p>One thing Chancellor absolutely needs to do to win this matchup is stop Gronkowski at the line of scrimmage, because he is such a force in the open field and Tom Brady will definitely find him.</p>\n<p>If the Patriots get to the red zone, then Chancellor will also have to take away the slant route New England uses to target its playing-making tight end.<br>\nGronkowski will get his looks, but Kam needs to win the majority of the battles for Seattle to gain the upper hand. So who will come up on top? Well, we’ll see soon enough.</p>\n<p>Advantage: Toss-up</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on pages 10 and 11 of January 29, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60243\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/superbowl-xlix-key-matchups-and-advantages/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60243\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/superbowl-xlix-key-matchups-and-advantages/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/superbowl-xlix-key-matchups-and-advantages/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/superbowl-xlix-key-matchups-and-advantages/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/superbowl-xlix-key-matchups-and-advantages/","id":2032,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[2031,2030,2029],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NFL Divisional Round: Matchups and Predictions","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sports editor Michael Jorgenson gives his predictions on what could be one of the most exciting Divisional Playoffs in recent memory.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>No. 6 Baltimore Ravens @ No. 1 New England</strong></p>\n<p>No matter what team they have to work with, Brady and Belichick have continued to find success.

The Panthers offense is too inconsistent in every important category to overcome the league’s No. 1 ranked defense.

Aaron Rodgers is the biggest question mark entering the game, but says he’s ready to go for this one. Both teams are formidable when it comes to the passing or running game, making this is a likely candidate for highest scoring game of the weekend. America’s team may have the edge if Rodgers is unable to fully perform.</p>\n<p>Prediction: Packers 35-24 Cowboys</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 8, 2014’s print

strenuous responsibilities. The rigor of these long days and weeks may not change with the times but the methods to each athlete’s madness surely do when transitioning from the long regular season to the all-important postseason or playoffs.</p>\n<p>The UCSB men’s and women’s swim teams are familiar with this shift in time, perhaps more than any other athletes, when they begin to prepare for their last meet of the year, the MPSF Championships.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This meet, unlike most sports’ playoff style, is one single competition featuring every team in the conference with the winner taking all.</p>\n<p>With all the weight on this final meet, a unique style of preparation is necessary to ensure success for team. The veterans of these dominant teams have truly mapped out their own individual style as they prepare for what could be their last NCAA meet.</p>\n<p>“Everyone prepares differently for big meets,” senior sprinter Wade Allen said. “I myself tend to enjoy the weeks leading up as workouts get lighter which allows for more rest and recovery.”</p>\n<p>For athletes like Allen, who carries a heavy workload for his team and greatly contributes to their success, it takes a balanced mixture of mental and physical preparation to compete against the best swimmers in the conference for the title. He has surely faced them all individually, but to have them all in the pool at once knowing that they have all trained for that same moment of stepping on to the starting block is a notion that can distract the greatest of athletes.</p>\n<p>“In-season dual meets are routine. With championship meets comes great unpredictability,” Allen says. “It is important to keep your composure. Getting mentally prepared is a completely different game than the physical portion.”</p>\n<p>Their preparation varies from athlete to athlete. Redshirt senior breaststroker Katie Records takes a more traditional approach to get ready for the “Big One”.</p>\n<p>Both athletes claim to enjoy visualizing their race in the training leading up to the meet and when race time comes, but both also make sure that they do not overthink their strategies to a fault.</p>\n<p>Records finds a ritual in sporting her big swim jacket and hood, as she sits behind her future lane, to black out any possible distractions visually and focus on her lane. She always has her headphones in with pump-up music playing to disintegrate the audible distractions of every MPSF team cheering on their teammates.</p>\n<p>For senior sprinter Chris Dotson, a different strategy keeps him going when it comes time for the actual meet.</p>\n<p>“I swim my best when I’m extremely relaxed, smiling and high-fiving my buddies behind the blocks,” Dotson said. “Naturally you will go through waves of emotions and motivation throughout, and it is the ones who can handle the ups and downs that is ultimately determined the winner.”</p>\n<p>Dotson finds that he gets his drive and energy by feeding off of his teammates, who Records claims are the loudest on the deck. He finds that the momentum a team can build by hyping each other up and running with the energy not only gives them a physical boost, but also a mental edge over their opponents. This kind of motivation pushes him when he is in the spotlight and prevents him from doing what some athletes tend to do: crack under the pressure.</p>\n<p>All three athletes agree that the preparation leading up to the week of championships is as important as every aspect of the competition, but not maintaining this focus when race time comes nearly forfeits that preparation. Allen begins training and maintaining as early as five weeks before the meet, when the team is still in the regular season, but knows once he is on the deck it is purely about focus and energy. Records, winner of multiple Big West Athlete of the Week awards this season, knows the state she must be in to race.</p>\n<p>“I definitely get into a zone before all of my races,” Records says. “Maintaining focus throughout the meet is crucial for us and then the support of our teammates get us in the mindset to just race fast.”</p>\n<p>The physical preparation is all said and done now with the team currently residing in Los Angeles as the MPSF Championships have kicked off. The last five weeks of “tapering,” as they call it, has been completed and their bodies are in shape to go all out. All three Gauchos shared a common goal in mind before embarking on their trip south: bring home the gold.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of February 19, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Daniel is a beat writer for the UCSB swim and men’s tennis teams.
