id=\"caption-attachment-84667\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sweet said he has been barred from entering campus. <em>Courtesy of UCSB Faculty Page</em></p></div>\n<p>Sweet’s leave of absence comes after a junior faculty member and an undergraduate summer trainee filed a complaint against him regarding an interaction in July of this year.</p>\n<p>Sweet detailed the interaction and his difficulties dealing with the UCSB administration in a Facebook post on Oct. 13.</p>\n<p>“A junior faculty member got a key to my locked graduate student office room and put one of his off-campus undergraduate summer trainees at the desk of one of my graduate students, displacing her private materials,” Sweet said in the Facebook post.</p>\n<p>Noticing the unlocked office, Sweet requested the undergraduate trainee leave the graduate student’s office.</p>\n<p>“I informed [the junior faculty member] of department policy on secure offices for grad students, and copied my department chair, late afternoon,” Sweet said. “She replied that she’d sort it out, and next morning sent an email telling [the junior faculty member] he was out of line, and that I had responded appropriately.”</p>\n<p>Sweet believed the issue was resolved at the time, but the administration presented a formal charge against him and suspended him approximately two and a half months later.</p>\n<p>According to Sweet’s personal inquiry into the matter, the details of the complaint were not the same as Sweet’s understanding of the encounter.</p>\n<p>Sweet was allegedly told that he “stalked” the female undergraduate trainee, “waited until she was alone” and “harassed and bullied her” before she fled, according to Sweet’s Facebook post.</p>\n<p>“The allegation and all of its add-ons are just flat out false,” he said.</p>\n<p>As of late October, Sweet is unable to access his on-campus office and teach classes.</p>\n<p>In an updated Facebook post on Oct. 24, Sweet said one of his courses is canceled and the other is being taught by a grad student.</p>\n<p>“I think this is an example of how hypersensitivity to sexual harassment can be used unfairly to try to settle scores,” Sweet said. “I don’t know what score is being settled here, but it is causing a lot of disruption, not simply to my good name.”</p>\n<p>“I am aware that former students and scientific colleagues worldwide have reacted with incredulity… UCSB is getting a monstrous black eye over this.”</p>\n<p>UCSB did not offer an official statement regarding Sweet’s case.</p>\n<p>Sweet’s full Facebook post can be viewed <a

Main space as a “safe space for the workers to decompress” for the duration of the strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s important to have the institutional support behind the workers who are really just asking for fair wages and stable benefits,” Solomon said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also asks the Senate to formally endorse the strike and requests the Office of the Student Advocate (OSA) have a representative at the strike to offer OSA resources and services for the workers on strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student Advocate General (S.A.G.) Grecia Martinez will also be purchasing $600 worth of food and beverages for the workers through the Senate’s unallocated funds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Senate decided to double the original amount requested ($300) after learning that the strike is expecting approximately 500 students per day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution also calls upon A.S. President Brooke Kopel and Chancellor Henry T. Yang to write a letter in support of the strike to Janet Napolitano, UCOP (UC Office of the President), the UC Board of Regents and UC Labor Relations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I will readily write the letter and consult the authors of the resolution and students that worked on it for input on the letter,” Kopel said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second resolution, authored by Palmerin and Briseno, calls for an A.S. “work stoppage” in support of the strike. It promises to compensate the A.S. student workers who sign in at the strike and miss their shifts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A.S. entities that will be affected by the work stoppage include the A.S Bike Shop, A.S. Recycling, A.S. Department of Public Worms, A.S. Zero Waste Committee, A.S. Publications and the A.S Main building, according to the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facilities including the A.S. Food Bank and the A.S. Legal Resource Center will not be closed due to the nature of the services they provide for students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution also requires no police presence in A.S. Main for the duration of the strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third resolution, authored by Cornejo and Uribe, encourages student workers to strike in solidarity and “endorses the usage of any and all AS resources in providing aid” to students who do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building upon the resolution presented by Solomon and Toubian, this resolution also requires OSA to offer several services including “information relating to University rights, protocols, and procedures, information on strikes and protests rights and procedures, information on appeals processes, and referrals to local legal representation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) plans to strike from Oct. 23 to Oct. 25 to protest a “year and a half of deadlocked negotiations [and] concerns about growing racial and gender disparities within UC’s workforce,” according to a press release from AFSCME spokesperson John de los Angeles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Numerous undergraduate and graduate students spoke at public forum, calling for the A.S.

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Daily Nexus archives</em></p></div>\n<p>In response to the demands set forth by the protesters, the Department of Black Studies was established.</p>\n<p>The creation of that department paved the way for additional departments such as the Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies, the Department of Feminist Studies and the Department of Asian American Studies.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think in retrospect that we fully understood or comprehended the significance and the lifetime gravity that that event represented,” Murad Rahman, chair of the Black Student Union (BSU) in 1968, said.</p>\n<p>“We certainly by no means did we know and fully understand all of it … maybe until years and years after that, in my opinion.”</p>\n<p>Rahman remembers the events of Oct. 14 that year clearly.</p>\n<p>He and the 11 other students shouldered uncertainty, risk and, most of all, unwavering resolve as they took over North Hall.</p>\n<p>At the time, North Hall held the mainframe computer for the entire UC system and was considered “the most critical point” of the campus, Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Rahman and other students attended UCSB during a time of tumultuous social and political climate. Significant moments, such as the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy as well as the rise of prominence of Malcolm X and the Black Power Movement, created the backdrop against which students experienced college life.</p>\n<p>Being among the small number of African American students at the time provided a difficult environment to navigate, Cynthia Davis, secretary for BSU in 1968, recalled.</p>\n<p>“There was a[n] identity crisis because we were such a minority there on campus,” Davis said. “Because of that fact, sort of being isolated like that … we tried to find ways where we could group together to support one another.”</p>\n<p>BSU was an important avenue for African American students to support each other and discuss the challenges they faced as students at UCSB and a minority race in the 1960s, according to Davis.</p>\n<p>Students of BSU worked to raise awareness about issues faced by African American students and fight for changes they felt would benefit their community and black communities throughout the nation, Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Dalton Nezey, a football player in 1968 and one of North Hall Takeover participants, joined forces with Rahman and other BSU members in discussion about what the school needed to be doing better for its black students.</p>\n<p>Several of those discussions revolved around the mistreatment of black athletes on the football team, which included the lack of financial aid given to black athletes in comparison to their white counterparts, the use of derogatory language by coaching staff and the general lack of respect black students were given.</p>\n<p>“We felt that we were being treated differently, and … in that conversation about football, we started looking at the structure of the campus,” Nezey said.</p>\n<p>These complaints, coupled with “racial insensitivity, [and] racial illiteracy” on campus as well as the national social strife at the time, were the final catalyst for the North Hall Takeover, Rahman said.</p>\n<p>In secret – from the public as well as most members of the BSU at the time – Rahman, Nezey and other students devised a plan to secure the computer center at North Hall and demand changes at UCSB from the chancellor at the time, Vernon Cheadle.</p>\n<p>Students planned the “high-risk operation” two weeks in advance.</p>\n<p>BSU members located all the exits in the building, prepared for attempted infiltration from police and threats of violence. They also determined how they would communicate and negotiate with key players on the outside.</p>\n<p>Even on the morning of the Takeover, some of the protestors, though resolved in their mission, were apprehensive about what the rest of the day would entail.</p>\n<p>“We knew we were doing the right thing … the question was, how fearful were we of the consequences? That was the issue,” Thomas Crenshaw, one of the protestors, said.</p>\n<p>“Were we fearful? Yeah, we were fearful. Were we afraid? Yeah, we were afraid. There were a lot of us who met to go into North Hall. Only 12 of us showed up.”</p>\n<p>The 12 students arrived at North Hall around 6 a.m. on Oct. 14, when they anticipated the halls would be empty of workers and students. The protestors convinced the few technicians who were present to leave after explaining the gravity of the situation about to take place.</p>\n<p>The students had coordinated a team on the outside to facilitate negotiations at the chancellor’s office while the 12 remained barricaded inside North Hall.</p>\n<p>Booker Banks, another member of the 12 inside the building, addressed the crowd gathered outside the building throughout the day. He kept them both informed and entertained during the negotiations.</p>\n<p>“[Banks] was very, very crucial in making the whole operation a success and in winning over the minds and hearts of students [so] that what we were doing inside and the whole operation was a positive and constructive event,” Rahman said.</p>\n<p>It was late afternoon when the 12 received word the chancellor’s office had agreed to the demands.</p>\n<p>“It was a moment of celebration, a moment of relief because we didn’t know whether or not our demands were going to be met,” Rahman said.</p>\n<p>50 years later, the North Hall Takeover remains one of the most significant actions take by BSU and has had reverberating effects on campus.</p>\n<p>But the advancements set in motion by these students’ actions were far greater than they could have imagined at the time.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84425\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84425\" data-attachment-id=\"84425\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/50-years-ago-12-students-and-the-takeover-that-changed-everything/50th-anniversary_online-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"50th anniversary_ONLINE-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-84425\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=1832%2C1374&amp;ssl=1 1832w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=1376%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/50th-anniversary_ONLINE-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84425\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Several of the 12 protestors gathered at UCSB to celebrate the Takeover’s 50th anniversary. <em>Courtesy of Professor Jeffrey Stewart</em></p></div>\n<p>“What’s really amazing to me is to look at all the pictures and see yourself in these pictures at 18, 19 years old not realizing that you’re contributing to history at the time but that you have made history,” Davis said.</p>\n<p>“You feel very proud that you happen to be in the right place at the right time to make such a positive contribution.”</p>\n<p>Many of the participants cite the Takeover as a significant moment in their lives, both shaping their time at UCSB as well as the future they would go on to have.</p>\n<p>“[My involvement] shows and is an indication to my children and my grandchildren as to sacrifices that sometimes have to made in order for progress to be attained,” Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Rahman now works as a supervising case manager for a community organization in Los Angeles working toward gang prevention.</p>\n<p>Davis also attributes her time in BSU as “stirr[ing] up in me the importance to learn more about my heritage, to be proud of who I was and to be in a position to fight for basic civil rights.”</p>\n<p>She currently works as an assistant professor at Charles R.
