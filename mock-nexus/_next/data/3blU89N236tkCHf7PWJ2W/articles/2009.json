As many as 28 different types of light bulbs sold at the five major retailers allegedly contain patented technology, according to the court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that from 2010 to 2019, researchers at UCSB’s Solid State Lighting and Energy Electronics Center (SSLEEC) patented a series of four innovations that allowed LED lights to mimic the orange glow of Thomas Edison’s clear incandescent light bulbs without toxic filaments and at a fraction of the cost, according to court documents obtained from Levy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The documents, all of which are duplicates save for minor changes, credit three full-time UCSB professors with inventing the patents: James “Jim” Speck, Steven DenBaars and Shuji Nakamura, who was the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All are materials professors within the College of Engineering. DenBaars is also an electrical and computer engineering professor, while Nakamura is the solid state lighting and energy center co-director. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nakamura did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding the alleged patent infringements.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joseph “Joe” Incandela, vice chancellor for research at UCSB, said in a statement to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that the unpaid royalties from the retailers in the lawsuit can be put back into “future research, education, and the development of new technologies.” Incandela is also a physics professor at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope that the action taken by UC Santa Barbara will underline the importance of respecting the rights of university patent owners,” Incandela said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Court complaints note that “substantially all” light fixtures allegedly produced using UCSB’s filament technology are manufactured in China. Target and Walmart had knowledge of patented technology on their shelves as early as December 2017, according to court complaints, when the two stores were sent a “notice of infringement” from the university.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The strategy has been to reach out directly to the retailers because the products are primarily made overseas, which makes it impractical and difficult for UC to pursue infringement,” Levy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, UCSB made efforts to form licensing agreements with retailers outside of court, Levy said, but was stiff-armed by retailers after unsuccessful attempts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Businesses, particularly certain industry sectors like these sorts of consumer products, tend to either ignore or just discount any outreach they have from a university about their need for a license,” Levy said. “They don’t think a university is actually going to enforce those patents, so they just ignore it and carry that risk.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, in 2019, five years after patented products allegedly began saturating the market, UCSB is seeking litigation. The university was hesitant to sue, Levy said: “Litigation, especially of this scale, is a last resort.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levy noted that UCSB’s Office of Technology and Industry Alliances made “a lot of efforts to have business conversations with appropriate entities in the lighting industry,” but said they had no luck, and litigation became “necessary.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The instances when universities seek legal action over patent rights are rare, Levy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Until this case, there really are very few examples of universities directly enforcing their patent rights against industry,” Levy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s decision to seek litigation comes on the backdrop of a much larger issue in which the threat of stolen knowledge is constantly looming, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a systemic problem … It’s important for academic institutions to have tools like this available to them to make sure their rights are respected.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If UCSB is successful in court, the money would be split three ways between Longford Capital — a litigation firm working with the university — SSLEEC researchers responsible for the patents and UCSB itself, </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-07-30/uc-santa-barbara-sues-led-lightbulbs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloomberg reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

process in each case. <em>Nexus File Photo </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student, referred to in court documents as John Doe, is suing on his own behalf as well as on behalf of all other UC students who were disciplined under several different sexual harassment and sexual violence policies ranging from 2015 to 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The policies, according to the lawsuit, include: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 2015 Interim Policy on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence, implemented on 6/17/2015</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California PACAOS-Appendix-E: Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Student Adjudication Framework, implemented on 1/1/2016</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy, implemented on 1/1/2016 </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Interim Appendix E – Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment (SVSH) Student Adjudication Framework, implemented on 3/1/2019</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All local University of California campus procedures modeled after the aforementioned system-wide policies</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that the UC Regents uses an investigation model that has been found unlawful in previous court cases, referencing the January 2019 case </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">v. Allee</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In the case, the court ruled that students accused of sexual misconduct in cases where the credibility of witness reports are central to the claim must be allowed to cross-examine the witnesses — either directly or indirectly and in person or through a method like videoconferencing, in front of a neutral judge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the UC’s investigation model, the responsibility for the investigation falls to “a single [Title IX investigator] who acted as police, prosecutor, jury, and judge without a live, in-person hearing before impartial adjudicators where the accused could question or cross-examine the complainant and witnesses,” the suit alleges. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC changed its adjudication process in March 2019 after the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe v. Allee</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ruling to comply with the live hearing requirement. On July 31, the UC unveiled a more comprehensive guide to the hearing process, one that is “fair, treats parties with respect and compassion, and results in just and reliable outcomes,” according to the </span><a href=\"https://www.ucop.edu/title-ix/resources/student-adjudication-framework/interim-svhs-student-adjudication-framework-ppt.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">July SVSH Student Investigation and Adjudication Framework</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe’s suit represents those who were disciplined under the policies before the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe v. Allee</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ruling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe’s specific Title IX case began in February 2017, court documents say, when UCLA’s Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity received a report that Doe had allegedly sexually harassed and stalked another student on multiple occasions between September 2016 and February 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit says Doe cooperated with the school, “meeting with the Title IX investigator several times and providing documents to support his defense that the allegations against him were entirely false.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe alleges that he asked for access to the evidence collected by the investigator but had his requests denied by both the investigator and UCLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that while the investigation “disclosed no direct evidence” of either stalking or sexual harassment, the Title IX investigator concluded there was a “preponderance of evidence” that Doe had engaged in sexual harassment and stalking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCLA Student Conduct Officer then confirmed the Title IX investigator’s findings and suspended Doe for two years. Doe appealed the decision and had his suspension reduced to one year after the appeal body found him responsible of sexual harassment but not stalking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe once again appealed the decision, arguing that “the finding was made in the absence of evidence supporting the elements of sexual harassment in the Policy and the application of a minimum one-year suspension for ‘other sexual contact’ in the absence of any contact whatsoever was improper.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His suspension was reduced to three months, but he was required to reapply to UCLA and “submit documentation of his ability to be a student ‘without engaging in any behavior that would violate university policy.’” He would also be placed on disciplinary probation for the rest of his time at UCLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A second proposed class member in the lawsuit, John Doe2, was a graduate student at an unnamed UC campus in 2016 when he was notified in March that the campus’s Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity had been notified of research misconduct and stalking allegations against him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe2 was ordered to stay 100 yards from the graduate student he allegedly harassed, and he was restricted from his research. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to Doe’s case, Doe2 alleges that he cooperated with the investigation and provided evidence that proved the allegations against him false, and was also not allowed to see other evidence collected by the investigator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that the investigation “disclosed no direct evidence” of stalking, computer hacking or that “any online accounts were compromised or hacked,” but Doe2 was found guilty of stalking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe2 says in the suit that there were 113 exhibits of evidence that were not provided to him and 40 unidentified witnesses who were not named, even though he repeatedly requested the evidence and the witness statements, including through the California Public Records Act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe2 was suspended for two years, but he appealed the decision and had his suspension reduced to one year after the appeal body decided he was not responsible for violating the stalking and sexual violence policies, only the physical abuse policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe2 appealed the decision once again but had his appeal denied. He then filed a writ to “set aside the improper administrative finding that [he] is responsible for a violation of Conduct Policy 102.08 and the one-year suspension.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court ruled in Doe2’s favor, and the university started a new Title IX investigation in December 2018. Doe2 alleges there has been no action from the university since then. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC spokesperson Claire Doan said they had not been served with the lawsuit and had no comment at this time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ariana Alvarez, Title IX director at UCSB, said she believed the Title IX process offered students due process and declined to comment on the case specifically. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara County Court has reversed three UC Santa Barbara Title IX decisions in the last year, noting a lack of due process in the Title IX process in each case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the</span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-08-15/uc-regents-found-in-contempt-of-court-expelled-student-allowed-to-return-to-ucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> first case</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Judge Donna D. Geck agreed with the student’s claim that UCSB’s internal policies were “Confusing, Internally Inconsistent, and Unfair,” and ruled that the UC Regents failed to provide the student with a fair hearing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-22/sb-superior-court-reverses-ucsb-students-suspension-for-sexual-assault/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">second case</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Geck again called attention to the Title IX process, writing in the decision that in the university’s hearing, “Noticeably absent was even a semblance of due process.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the accused does not receive a fair hearing, neither does the accuser,” Geck added in court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucsb-student-exonerated-from-relationship-violence-charges-after-629-days/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">third case</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Judge Thomas P. Anderle found that the school predetermined the student’s guilt, thus violating the due process requirements of the federal and state constitutions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Instead of making that decision based upon facts, the law, and in fairness, [UCSB] has decided to do it their own way,” Anderle wrote in court documents.</span></p>\n<p>The full lawsuit can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190802-Amended-Petition.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [8/9]: This article has been updated to include a link to the full lawsuit.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Moving away is always a difficult thing to do. No matter the age, moving away from the people you made bonds with and the places you grew attached to is something that most would like to avoid.</p>\n<p>Sometimes though, moving away to a new place is the only option to keep on doing what they love. This is true about UCSB’s own Mitchell Hamilton, a junior sociology major who had to leave his dream school to come to Santa Barbara and continue doing what he loves most: playing water polo. It is a decision he certainly has come to love and embrace.</p>\n<p>Hamilton grew up loving water polo. He was a star polo player in high school, leading his team to four league championships. He was also honored with achievements such as First Team All-America and First Team All CCS. However, he says he owes all his success to his mother, the person who encouraged him to play such a demanding sport.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I started playing water polo when I was in seventh grade,” Hamilton said. “My mom was the one who pushed me into water polo and I really owe a lot to her.”</p>\n<p>Being the great high school player that he was, Hamilton had many options to continue his playing career. Ultimately he settled on Cal, a school he admired growing up, not only for its academics, but also its consistently good water polo program.</p>\n<p>Hamilton seemed to have made the right choice at the time. As a freshman, he scored 16 goals for the Golden Bears and was a key player on the team. Cal eventually made it to the MPSF Championship against USC before losing the match 9-5. Still, as a freshman Hamilton played a big role, scoring two goals in that game, a good sign for the future.</p>\n<p>As a sophomore, Hamilton again registered 16 goals along with 15 assists. Once again he was a big factor on the team even though it didn’t make a run as deep as the year before.</p>\n<p>“I loved Cal. The players were great.” Hamilton said. “I liked the competiveness that went on in practice. I felt like everybody was really fighting for a spot to travel every practice.”</p>\n<p>Although Hamilton showed great promise and had a great two years at Cal, something always bothered him. He kept on having troubles with the coaching staff. The issues got so bad that he decided to leave the water polo program after his sophomore season.</p>\n<p>“After a while I didn’t see eye-to-eye with the coach, which is why I left the program.” Hamilton said. “I didn’t want to play for him anymore. It was a tough personal choice.”</p>\n<p>Hamilton now was faced with the toughest choice of his young adult life; to return to Cal without ever playing water polo again or leave the school he loved. He decided to take a semester away from school to really think about what he wanted, working as a math tutor and caterer in the meantime.</p>\n<p>“It was actually really fun,” Hamilton said happily. “It was nice to make some money and just take time off. My family was also very supportive, something I am thankful for.”</p>\n<p>While Hamilton was deciding his next step during the 2014-2015 campaign, the UCSB water polo program was suffering its worst season ever. The Gauchos finished 11-15, winless in conference play, and finished seventh place in the MPSF championships.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Wolf Wigo knew his roster was more than talented to make a better run next year but he also knew getting a player like Hamilton wouldn’t hurt. The two were almost meant for each other. Hamilton needed a new start and Wigo needed another attacker to replace Eric Van de Mortel, who graduated after last season as one of UCSB’s top offensive players.</p>\n<p>“When Wolf reached out and contacted me, he really highlighted the great opportunities I would have at UCSB,” Hamilton said. “And the guys on the team are all a bunch of winners, which are the type of people I like hanging out with.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Hamilton was swayed and decided to come play his remaining two years of eligibility at Santa Barbara, a decision that has been beneficial for everyone involved.</p>\n<p>Since coming here, Hamilton has set new career highs in both goals scored and steals with 21 and 18 respectively. He has also become a team leader and is a guy that the whole locker room respects.</p>\n<p>“My new career highs are cool but I’m not worried about that,” Hamilton said. “I’m just really happy to be on such a great water polo team and contributing to wins.”</p>\n<p>Hamilton’s modesty is admirable; however, his head coach knows that he is a big factor on this team and is happy that he decided to join.</p>\n<p>“He’s the fastest guy on this team,” Wigo said. “He helps with the counter-attack and he’s a great player enjoying a great season. He’s also a guy that works everyday as hard as he can and sets a good example for the younger guys. I’m really proud of him.”</p>\n<p>Hamilton is not just a hit with the coaching staff, but also with the players. He is a great locker room guy that the players love being around. This is no more apparent than with seniors Derek Shoemaker and Chris Whitelegge.</p>\n<p>“He plays a huge role on this team and his shot is deadly,” Shoemaker said. “He’s my roommate and I love hanging with him. He’s a great influence and he’s been a great teammate.”</p>\n<p>“He’s just such a skilled player.” Whitelegge added. “I remember playing against him when he was at Cal and he was good then, I’m glad he plays for us now. He’s great to be around and his positive energy constantly rubs off on the team.”</p>\n<p>With the seniors departing soon as the season is coming to an end, Hamilton will be the new face of UCSB water polo, something that he has earned with his great play and something he hopes to keep living up to.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, leaving Cal was very hard, but it seems to have paid off for Hamilton. He has been able to be a factor on a team that has been very welcoming of him and he has come to love the atmosphere of Santa Barbara in general.</p>\n<p>“I love the ocean, and the girls are beautiful here,” Hamilton jokingly said. “I just really love it here and I love this team. I love being back on a team with a bunch of great dudes, playing a game I love.
