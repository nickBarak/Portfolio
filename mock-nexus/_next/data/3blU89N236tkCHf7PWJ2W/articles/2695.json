We have been around since 1930, and we’ve been student-run and independent ever since.</p>\n<p>In the past 85 years, we have consistently won top rankings in competitions across the state and, in both 2012 and 2013, we were nationally ranked as a top-10 college newspaper by The Princeton Review. We were the only UC newspaper to receive that honor. But weirdly enough, we don’t actually have a journalism program at UCSB — which we consider to be one of our biggest advantages.</p>\n<p>Because we are not funded or sponsored by the university, we are able to give the students an organic, uncensored voice that does not have to go through any type of university editing. This means we get to do things like publish a story that leads to the resignation of a corrupt chancellor who embezzled over $170,000 (1986, Steve Elzer on ex-Chancellor Robert Huttenback), and the university cannot stop it from being published.</p>\n<p>We also get to do shit like say “shit,” because that’s how some students speak, and we have a duty to respect that creative decision. But the coolest part of being independent is that, each year, all of us get to make the Nexus exactly what we want it to be. All of us meaning the people who work here, sure, but also you, reader.</p>\n<p>We have our history, traditions and our standards, but every day we have the opportunity to make this paper exactly what we want it to be. If you want to see more coverage on this, tell me! If you want to see less talk about that, tell me! If we messed up or continue to mess up, please tell me! I am as much your employee as anyone’s, and it’s my job to make sure that the content delivered to you is as perfect as it can be.</p>\n<p>Imagine the Daily Nexus as your megaphone. If you have something to say — which I sincerely hope you all do — we’ll help you say it louder. And if you want to work with us, there’s always room. We have about 200 people working with us already, but this is a family that is always looking to grow.</p>\n<p>Come visit us under Storke Tower, check out our orientation sessions on September 28 and 29 at 6:30 p.m., enjoy a free carnival and FMLYBND concert on September 22 from 1-4 p.m. in Storke Plaza and send me an email at eic@dailynexus.com.</p>\n<p>So, whether it’s your first time on campus or your last first time on campus, welcome to paradise! I can’t wait to work with you all.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,<br>\nEmile Nelson</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of the Thursday, August 27, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily

id=\"caption-attachment-66304\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Accessible, Attainable, Affordable Coalition UCSB (AAAC) will host #MillionStudentMarch Thursday beginning at Storke Tower to demand tuition-free public colleges, the cancellation of all student debt and a $15 minimum wage for all campus workers.</p>\n<p>The march, which will begin at noon, is part of a nationwide movement including all UC campuses and over 90 other colleges and universities. AAAC is organizing the event with the United States Student Association, the Associated Students (A.S.) Office of the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA), the A.S. Office of the Student Advocate and UCSB-4-Bernie.</p>\n<p>Event organizer and second-year mathematics major Kyle Butts said the UC Board of Regents treats the University as more of a corporate entity than an academic institution, beginning when Ronald Reagan became governor of California.</p>\n<p>“Reagan ushered in an era of neoliberal thinking in California while he was governor,” Butts said. “That coupled with 17 Regents being business men who serve 12 year terms and only one student Regent, it is pretty clear that the UC is a business now to them.”</p>\n<p>According to Butts, the march will partially address how the 1960 California Master Plan for Higher Education, which reaffirmed California’s prior commitment to the principle of tuition-free education, has been abandoned.</p>\n<p>“This is evident in when Governor Schwarzenegger and the UC Regents met in 2004 for the Compact for Higher Education,” Butts said. “There they made clear that students and donations would be the primary sources of funding instead of state funding.”</p>\n<p>Butts said tuition-free college is attainable.</p>\n<p>“If we decide that it is time for our school to return to a true public university, we can make it happen,” Butts said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Residents of California did not have to pay to go to a university like UC Santa Barbara fifty years ago, so I ask what makes us different from the students 50 years ago. I say there is no difference.<br>\n–<em> Josephine Ampaw</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Event organizer and third-year political science and feminist studies double major Josephine Ampaw said she hopes the Teach In AAAC hosted last week succeeded in educating students on tuition and debt and inspired attendees to affect change.</p>\n<p>“I hope this course of action will first off be taken seriously by our city, state and national leaders, who will execute a plan in order to make free higher education a reality after bringing the demands to the center stage,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p>According to Ampaw, accessible higher education is an investment in the future of the country.</p>\n<p>“I believe students have to fight for free tuition because education is a right, not a privilege,” Ampaw said. “Every person who lives in the state of California, in the United States and across the globe deserves the right to not only a elementary and secondary education, but to a higher education as well.”</p>\n<p>Ampaw said California has had tuition-free public higher education in the past.</p>\n<p>“Residents of California did not have to pay to go to a university like UC Santa Barbara fifty years ago, so I ask what makes us different from the students 50 years ago. I say there is no difference,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p>According to Butts, the demand for a $15 minimum wage for all UC workers aims to facilitate the “American Dream.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a whole class of people who aren’t given the same opportunity as middle and upper middle-status people. With expensive public education and a $9 minimum wage, they as a collective are not able to overcome poor conditions with hard work,” Butts said. “Instead, the Million Student March is trying to level the playing field and create accessible forms of social mobility.”</p>\n<p>Butts said UCSB is a hub for student political engagement.</p>\n<p>“Looking at the history of UCSB and the UC system as a whole, I think we’re the heart of the student movement,” Butts said. “By hosting the march here at UCSB, we’re simply entering the long history we’ve had in activism.”</p>\n<p>Second-year psychology major Hannah Houska said the “the fight is now” against tuition hikes, because UC’s tuition freeze will end at the 2017-18 academic year.</p>\n<p>“Our goal is not to continue the cycle of tuition hike and tuition freeze, but rather our goal is to lower tuition,” Houska said.</p>\n<p>According to Butts, #MillionStudentMarch will encourage students to be more politically active.</p>\n<p>“Come Thursday, it will be clear that frustration will bring students out,” Butts said. “It would be so easy to not come, but a million students across this country are going to have this issue be talked about, so activism is alive and well here at UCSB.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

On-campus senator and second-year economics and political science double major Nawar Nemeh presented five bills written by himself and off-campus senator and third-year political science major Stevan Abdalmalik regarding future A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>UCPD Lieutenant Mark Signa said the department is currently discussing events as alternatives to the I.V. party scene during Halloween and the option of assigning fewer law enforcement officers to the community than were present last year.</p>\n<p>“As we’ve done in the past year, there has been a good reduction of people during Halloween,” Signa said. “The general plan is focusing hard on putting together concerts on campus that draw students on campus to sober events. The goal is to start reducing the number of officers. We want to have Halloween known not as an outsider event but a local event for Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh presented “A Bill to Switch Associated Students Elections to a Single Transferable Vote System.” Nemeh said a single transferable vote system, which aims to establish proportional representation by allowing voters to rank candidates, could improve voter representation in A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>“This process ensures that votes are not wasted,” Nemeh said. “We want to have a multi-party system.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh then presented and “A Bill to Update Article XIX Section 2 of the Associated Students Legal Code,” which outlines a new process by which new political parties register through the Office of Student Life (OSL).</p>\n<p>Nemeh said parties should register as campus political organizations through OSL because they are active year round.</p>\n<p>“The Elections Code assumes parties aren’t active outside of week four of winter through week six of spring quarters, which is certainly not true,” Nemeh said.</p>\n<p>Nemeh also said political parties registered as campus organizations through OSL would receive an advisor to help them “organize politically” throughout the year.</p>\n<p>“Students who feel unsafe or stressed out or lost will have an advisor as a resource for this party,” Nemeh said.</p>\n<p>Nemeh then presented “A Bill to Update Article XIX Section 4 of the Associated Students Legal Code,” which outlines A.S. campaign regulations such as procedures for candidate forums.</p>\n<p>Senate tabled the five bills until its following meeting on Oct. 7.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64982\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/a-s-discusses-halloween-party-system-bills/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64982\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/a-s-discusses-halloween-party-system-bills/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/a-s-discusses-halloween-party-system-bills/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/a-s-discusses-halloween-party-system-bills/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/a-s-discusses-halloween-party-system-bills/","id":2694,"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez"},"related":[2693,2692,2691],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
