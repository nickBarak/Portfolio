Michael Little and his wife, Tiffany Little, filed their own lawsuit against the department in March 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Siegel alleges in her lawsuit that she was sexually harassed by Michael Little, Smorodinsky and an unnamed officer and was later denied a promotion after she refused to enter into a relationship with Smorodinsky. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the lawsuit, Siegel worked for the department between June 2015 and August 2019; after reporting several instances of harassment, she resigned after being told by UCPD Chief James Brock that she had become a “target” within the department. Brock took over the department as the interim chief in May 2019 after former UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson, who is named in the other lawsuits, left the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The five other lawsuits </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-03/breaking-ucpd-officers-sue-ucpd-members-for-alleged-mistreatment-after-reporting-sergeant/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Little and Tiffany Little v.

Nearly all of the lawsuits allege violations of the California Whistleblower Protection Act, unsafe work practices and a “harassing” environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The attorney representing the Littles, Signa, Reyes and Stern did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding the status of the internal mediations. </span></p>\n<p><b>Allegations Against Little: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the lawsuit, after Siegel completed field training in spring 2016, Michael Little allegedly “grabbed Siegel’s lower back/buttocks area, pulled her close and tried to kiss her.” After she pulled away, a separate and unnamed UCPD sergeant then “pushed Plaintiff Siegel against a wall and attempted to kiss her.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In late 2017, Siegel allegedly reported to Lieutenant Rob Romero that the Littles were “causing a hostile workplace,” according to the lawsuit. She then brought up her concerns to Lieutenant David Millard, who allegedly told her that a sergeant within the department, Daniel Wilson, had stated that she “was causing issues in the department and needed to be investigated because of her gender and relationships.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the lawsuit states that after Siegel received a promotion to corporal and field training officer in October 2018, Michael Little, who “failed to get a position he applied for,” “became angry and began telling coworkers that Siegel only received her promotion because she was sleeping with a supervisor.”</span></p>\n<p>According to a statement provided by Michael Little’s lawyer, Little “categorically denies each and every allegation.”</p>\n<p><b>Allegations Against Smorodinsky: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the lawsuit, after Siegel applied for a forensic analyst position within the department in August 2018, Smorodinksy “ordered Siegel to come to his home” and “ordered her to leave her cell phone and radio in the car.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He then proceeded to tell her that she was the “top candidate for the forensic analyst position, but that he could not trust her because Siegel would not engage in the kind of personal relationship he wanted,” saying that he “wanted to get married and have babies with Siegel.” She told him that she “would not date” him, according to the lawsuit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuit states that a few days later, Smorodinsky called Siegel and told her that “she was not a good fit for the forensic analyst position.” When Siegel reportedly told him that “sometimes relationships do not work out the way we want them to and that’s just how it is,” he responded, “Well, when things don’t go the way you want them to at work, I’ll be sure to remind you that that’s just how it is.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Siegel further alleges that she faced discrimination from other officers. In one instance, while responding to a call about an intoxicated person with Wilson and Officer Saray Rubio, Rubio “refused to help” Siegel, stating, “I don’t have to do anything you tell me. You are not a real Corporal.” According to court documents, both Wilson and Rubio have “a close friendship” with Michael Little.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Siegel filed two Title IX complaints with the university during 2018 and 2019, but both were rejected, according to the lawsuit. She also reportedly filed sexual harassment complaints with a whistle-blower hotline, the university’s Office of the Ombuds and human resources. She “never received any resolution regarding her complaints,” according to the lawsuit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosanna Vargas, a representative from the attorney’s office representing Siegel, said in an email that Siegel “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hopes to be able to change the culture at the UCSB Police Department for future women in the police department.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ms. Siegel was a devoted police officer for the UCSB Police Department. However, her career was cut short because of the gender bias embedded throughout the police department,” the statement said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Though she complained about the harassment, her complaints were never thoroughly investigated by anyone at the police department or the Regents,” Vargas continued.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University spokesperson Andrea Estrada said that the university “cannot comment on pending litigation.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Updated [April 29, 2:22 p.m.]: This article was updated to include a statement from Little’s lawyer. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

The Nexus</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">agrees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Karnsrithong and Reynolds both said in their endorsement interviews that they hope to take advantage of the lobbying process and fight for legislation that supports student needs, Karnsrithong has no personal lobbying experience and lacks his opponent’s fluency in drafting legislation and reviewing policy. This is imperative, as the duty of the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) is to represent student needs on the UC, state and federal level through means such as lobbying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Karnsrithong struggled to answer basic questions about major student issues, including those about Title IX and even what the role of the EVPSA is. He did not seem to have any concrete platform points that he wanted to accomplish if elected, nor an understanding of what exactly an executive position demands of an individual. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frankly, the Nexus does not believe Karnsrithong is a competitive candidate, particularly juxtaposed with Reynolds, who has done a lot of advocacy work outside of A.S. already. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus was impressed with the depth of Reynolds’ platform points, as her well-planned and thought-out approach makes achieving her goals more likely if elected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having worked on a number of bills with Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, the representative for Santa Barbara County in the State Senate, Reynolds’ legislative experience adds to her ability to advocate for student needs and would aid her in achieving her main goals as EVPSA: providing basic needs for all communities, providing equitable financial aid, increasing funding for mental health resources on campus, protecting survivors’ rights and lobbying for policies to diversify the UC Board of Regents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her sophomore year, Reynolds expanded her background with legislation and policy when she joined SASA as a policy analyst. There, she organized UC Santa Barbara students’ lobbying efforts against United States Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos’ proposed amendments to Title IX.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the Department of Education is currently reviewing Title IX, Reynolds believes </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“it’s extremely important that survivors, and all students who could potentially become survivors, are protected from regulations that could detrimentally change the course of their cases and their lives.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, she plans to make use of the EVPSA’s statewide advocacy platform and her lobbying experience to fight for survivors and “uphold Obama-era Title IX policies.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Karnsrithong and Reynolds both agree that Title IX is not effective in its current form, Karnsrithong’s only experience with its policies come from his training as a resident assistant, and he was unable to speak specifically to what changes in Title IX policy needed to be made.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Reynolds does not have previous experience working inside the EVPSA office, she has worked closely with the office and Lobby Corps to host SASA’s first-ever Sexual Assault Awareness Month last April. During that month, she used her legislative experience to explain bills pertaining to sexual assault to students who signed up to lobby.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds became SASA’s president and UCSB director during her junior year. In her new roles, Reynolds worked to increase awareness about sexual assault and gender bias by organzing summits and town halls — many of which were scheduled to take place in April, which is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, and have now been canceled due to the coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through her involvement with SASA, she also helped create Isla Vista’s first-ever </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-15/center-dedicated-to-helping-victims-of-sexual-violence-opens-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">survivor resource center</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in October 2019, the product of a partnership between the Isla Vista Community Services District and Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds is also experienced with the UC Office of the President (UCOP) and the UC Student Association, necessary for the role of EVPSA, who is required to meet with the UC president on behalf of the student body frequently. She currently serves as UCSB’s undergraduate representative to the Title IX Student Advisory Board. Altogether, her history of working directly with the UC Student Association and the UCOP speaks to her qualifications for the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of basic needs, Reynolds plans to lobby for legislation that would push the UC to provide better mental health services for students. She also plans to expand the role of Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) and the Campus Advocacy Resource &amp; Education Center (C.A.R.E.) through increased funding and a “more diverse staff.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds also hopes to alleviate food insecurity by working with the A.S. Food Bank and lobbying for legislation that provides support to those who are food insecure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re all fighting for these basic needs as college students. And there shouldn’t be the fact that we have to have certain communities fight harder for them,” Reynolds said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds hopes to uplift marginalized groups by facilitating direct feedback from them but maintains that she would not speak on their behalf. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think prioritizing not only marginalized communities that are very visible in the community, but also ones that may be less visible, like the undocumented students at UCSB, is important,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to maintain transparency within the EVPSA office — something that Reynolds believes the current EVPSA, Daevionne Beasley, could have done better — she plans to hold town hall-style events where students can come together and hear about the work the EVPSA office is putting out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the nature of the EVPSA office’s budget, Reynolds wants to publicize the office’s expense reports, as “students should know exactly where their student fees are going.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking at Reynolds’ work so far, it’s clear that as EVPSA, she would have the experience and drive to continue advocating for students, albeit with a much larger platform. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My passion for students’ needs and for elevating students’ voices is instrumental in this work,” she said. “I don’t think you can do this type of work without having that passion.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Had Karnsrithong waited an extra year to run for EVPSA and taken the time to hone the skills necessary for the role, he could have been a strong contender. But this year, that is not the case. For the 2020-21 EVPSA term, Reynolds’ qualifications speak for themselves, and the Nexus is certain that she’s the right candidate for the job. </span></p>\n<p><em>Update: The Nexus has replaced the portraits done of each candidate with their self-submitted headshot.

2018, and the three-goal comeback against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the Champions League last year. Those were certainly nice moments. But they never felt indicative of broader success; rather, they felt lucky. United fans were happy we finished second because, frankly, we didn’t deserve to (thank you, David de Gea). United fans were happy we came back against PSG because we knew we lacked the quality to compete with a team of that caliber — something United proved when they flamed out in the next round against Barcelona.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But on Wednesday, when Manchester United dismantled Sheffield United 3-0, I felt hope.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I say dismantled because, well, the 3-0 scoreline doesn’t do justice to the performance. After two early goals, Manchester United was content to maintain possession, forcing the Blades to chase the ball around for most of the second half. The Red Devils kept 68% possession on Wednesday, while outshooting Sheffield United 13-4.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be transparent, it was a lackluster performance from Sheffield United, who have looked less-than-stellar since the restart. While the Blades still sit in an impressive eighth place, they’ve looked much more like the newly promoted side they are in recent times, rather than the team that was pushing to qualify for the Champions League back in March.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Wednesday’s performance was bigger than gaudy stats, bigger than an underwhelming opponent. No, Wednesday’s performance was a blueprint to future success for Manchester United.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since Manchester United acquired creative maestor Bruno Fernandes in January, pundits and fans alike have wondered how Fernandes could coexist with star French international Paul Pogba, who had spent most of the season on the sidelines with an ankle injury. In February and March — without Pogba — Fernandes displayed his quality, racking up 4 goals and 3 assists as an attacking midfielder. Fernandes’ ability to play a killer pass, as well as his lethal long-range shot, allowed Manchester United to better break down opponents playing a low defensive block.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a healthy Pogba, however, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had to devise a plan in which the two could play together. While both offer creativity and quality going forward, both also oftentimes struggle on the defensive end. Many pundits speculated that playing both together would cause problems for United’s back four.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it remains to be seen how the two perform together against a top opponent, Wednesday’s performance should help disprove that theory. Solskjaer employed Pogba as a deep-lying playmaker, which enabled him to control the pace of the game while still providing cover for the back line. Although not quite as dangerous going forward as he usually is, Pogba still had the ability to play dangerous through balls — which he successfully did throughout the game. Meanwhile, Fernandes operated in his favored attacking midfielder role, linking up with Pogba and the front three on multiple occasions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, Solskjaer utilized veteran midfielder Nemanja Matic as a holding midfielder who acted as the glue that kept the entire formation functional. There’s no doubt that the 31-year-old has lost a step in recent years; with Pogba and Fernandes ahead of him on the pitch, however, they don’t need his pace. Instead, Matic operated just in front of the full-backs, sniffing out any counterattacking chances that Sheffield United had when Pogba opted to move up the pitch into the attacking third.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be clear, Manchester United wasn’t flawless on Wednesday. Marcus Rashford — Manchester United’s top goal scorer this season — missed a few easy chances, although his passing was pristine. The Red Devils still desperately need a right winger: Mason Greenwood is great, but he’s a far better second-striker than winger. The backline of Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof — as solid as it’s been this season — still struggled against pacy counterattacks. And striker Anthony Martial won’t be able to score a hat trick every game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Manchester United wants to challenge for the title next season instead of fighting for a Champions League berth, it will need to improve on all of these fronts while renewing the contract of Pogba.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For the first time in recent memory, however, there’s a clear path ahead for Manchester United. It may not be much, but after everything that has gone wrong in the past seven years for the Red Devils, it’s a welcome start.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

Six applicants will then be selected after applications close on June 1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lisa Klock, the process innovation program manager of the College of Letters &amp; Science Information Technology (I.T.) department, explained that a visit to Westmont College in Santa Barbara served as a major catalyst for the internships. In observing Westmont I.T. interns, she noted that “it [was] extraordinary what the students are capable of” as they worked alongside faculty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klock stressed that UCSB’s internships are open to anyone “who’s really wanting this” and that they’re “not just looking for the coder.” All majors, she said — including humanities and social sciences majors — who demonstrate creativity, motivation and “a desire to learn something new” are welcome to apply.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Explore, dream and discover,” Klock summarized. “Coding can be taught.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although interns will be positioned in different departments and will be working with different sets of software, Klock said that students will still meet regularly to share their progress, talk about their experiences and present their work to administrators. The objective is to foster a sense of camaraderie among all six interns and prepare them for the “real world,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chief among the program’s considerations, Klock said, is to increase student involvement on campus and to “keep these students working for the UC and inside the UC family.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We only have what is known as ‘one deep’ structures in many of our IT operations,” Matthew Hall, associate vice chancellor for I.T. and chief information officer of UCSB, said in an email. “If a person leaves, it leaves a skills and capabilities gap.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The solution is to “immerse students in I.T. culture,” Klock said. That involves having undergraduates with full administrative privileges directly creating and editing the school’s digital infrastructure, she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a win-win,” Hall said. “Employers benefit by lowering the burden of on-boarding well-qualified candidates. And the interns are equipped with practical skill in a high demand field.” Another benefit, he said, would come in the form of “a potential pool of future employees” for the UC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, the coronavirus put a wrench in the internship plans, but staff members adapted the internship training in order to keep them on pace with the original schedule.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The pandemic struck the same month we sent out the application,” Rebecca Carroll, the technical project manager at Enterprise Technology Services, said. As a result, the I.T. department was forced to adapt the program relatively quickly during its shift to working remotely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carroll explained that internship training will be conducted throughout the summer, through either Zoom meetings or all-expenses-paid online courses like LinkedIn Learning, Pluralsight and the UCSB Learning Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For interns who may not have ready access to a device of their own, Carroll said, the department will provide them with laptops, with all of the necessary software pre-installed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Come fall quarter, Klock hopes that students will be able to physically work at the offices on campus “once everything opens up again.” In the meantime, she said her priorities include clear communication and assignments for interns and making sure that “the student is happy in their needs.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The results from this year’s pilot internships will inform the next year’s, Klock said, and in the coming years, her goal is to expand the program across the entire UC system.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94276\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-03/ucsb-information-technology-will-pilot-student-internship-program-in-summer-2020/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94276\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-03/ucsb-information-technology-will-pilot-student-internship-program-in-summer-2020/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-03/ucsb-information-technology-will-pilot-student-internship-program-in-summer-2020/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-03/ucsb-information-technology-will-pilot-student-internship-program-in-summer-2020/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-03/ucsb-information-technology-will-pilot-student-internship-program-in-summer-2020/","id":1796,"author":{"id":237,"name":"Yiu-On Li"},"related":[1795,1794,1793],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
