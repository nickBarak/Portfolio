Elections Board presented at Wednesday’s Senate meeting. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Elections Board initially mandated a special election for the EVPSA position to take place in Fall Quarter 2018 after Mayela Morales, a current fifth-year global studies and Chicanx studies double major, was disqualified approximately three weeks after the Spring Quarter 2018 elections were held. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Declaration of Candidacy period for the EVPSA special election officially ended on Oct. 2, leaving Madeline Loudon, the runner-up in the Spring Quarter 2018 EVPSA election, as the only candidate in the race. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final deadline to vote was extended multiple times, as the special election was repeatedly unable to meet the voter threshold. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final deadline to vote ended Nov. 4, with the special election unable to meet the 16 percent threshold.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Nov. 4, A.S. Elections Board Chair John Paul Renteria </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-04/breaking-evpsa-seat-to-be-left-vacant-for-rest-of-academic-year/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">confirmed </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">there will be no EVPSA for the 2018-19 school year following.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Nov. 8, Elections Board held a meeting in which Davis Quan, Elections Board member, motioned to hold a special election during Winter Quarter 2019 for the EVPSA position, citing that it would follow A.S. Legal Code, according to Elections Board minutes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If an executive officer position should become vacant after the fifth (5th) meeting of Fall Quarter, an election must be held by the fourth (4th) week of Winter quarter,” according to Article 11, section 2, (A.1.1) in A.S. Legal Code.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Elections Board held another meeting on Nov. 13, in which Elections Board member Andrew Yan motioned to set the voter threshold for the winter special election to 10 percent, according to Elections Board minutes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Quan stated that since the threshold for a General Election is 20%, a special election voter threshold for one position should be half of that,” the Elections Board minutes read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Wednesday’s A.S. Senate meeting, Elections Board Chair John Paul Renteria presented the petition to hold a special election during Winter Quarter 2019 for the EVPSA position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Elections Board’s minutes, Election’s Board would have begun advertising for the special election after the petition was approved by A.S. Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Wednesday’s A.S. Senate meeting, Renteria said he believed the threshold of 10 percent is obtainable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In June, A.S. Senate passed a resolution temporarily splitting the position’s funds and duties between the External Vice President for Local Affairs, the Student Advocate General, the A.S. President, the A.S. President Proxy and the Lobby Corps Co-Chairs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A letter from UC Student Association President Caroline Siegel Singh and Chair Davon Brandon Thomas said this vacancy is “deeply concerning and signals a lack of understanding of exactly how vital this position is to the UC Santa Barbara student body.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Due to the vacancy, UCSB students have already missed 2 of the quarterly meetings with UC President Janet Napolitano and her staff,” the letter continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is often during these meetings that EVPs are tasked with bringing up major campus issues to be addressed by the Office of the President.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The letter was voted on by the External Vice Presidents from every UC, their office staff and the board as a whole, according to the EVPSA office’s Campus Organizing Director Alexandra Gessesse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To be honest, we’re going to keep doing the same work. But what will the office look like to the larger state of California, I don’t know,” Gessesse said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an injustice to students’ needs and concerns beyond the absence of an executive member.”</span></p>\n<p>The full UCSA letter can be read <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ucsb-letter.pdf\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

They’re sitting here and they’re just putting stuff together,” he said.</p>\n<p>He added that while hip-hop has become more accessible to more people, some of the core elements of the genre have been compromised in the process.</p>\n<p>Sociology of Hip-Hop will discuss these types of paradoxes in the genre as well as changes in the messages, sounds and producers of hip-hop.</p>\n<p>“I’m really testing the boundaries of, like, what is modern hip-hop,” he said. “How does hip-hop go from poor people to what we’re seeing as rich people music?”</p>\n<p>Mitchell wants students to come out of the class having adequate knowledge about the social context of modern hip-hop as well as how to think critically about hip-hop, its producers and why it looks and sounds the way it does today.</p>\n<p>Discussion topics in Sociology of Hip-Hop will include stigmas, dichotomies of masculinity and femininity, sexualization and desexualization and LGBTQ+ artists and issues, according to Mitchell.</p>\n<p>“I’m gonna give you information and I want you to be able critically assess how do you feel and what do you agree with, what don’t you agree with, what do you know about hip-hop,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>Mitchell has been workshopping these courses since his first year at UCSB, when the idea to teach a course at UCSB in hip-hop first dawned on him.</p>\n<p>After teaching a hip-hop course at Los Prietos Boys Camp in his freshman year and later teaching a hip-hop class at Santa Barbara City College, Mitchell decided the topic was something that students at UCSB could also benefit from.</p>\n<p>“Hip-hop is actually very complex and complicated. It’s also very hands-on. People can learn that,” he said.</p>\n<p>Mitchell said the legitimacy of hip-hop as a serious musical genre is sometimes undermined by beliefs about it being too simple and too distant from the pillars of music theory. He expects there to be some criticisms of the hip-hop classes from colleagues and faculty once the class begins.</p>\n<p>“I have people that will love the class in the music department … and then a lot of people will for sure hate it and don’t like that it’s intentionally going away from Western pedagogies on purpose and intentionally not doing what my teacher taught me,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>These courses are offered through a program that allows students in the College of Creative Studies to teach a course during their time at UCSB. Students in the program must present syllabi and teaching plans for the course before they are approved to teach it, according to Mitchell.</p>\n<p>Mitchell worked on his plans for the courses throughout summer, having to make many changes throughout the process and prove the classes to be legitimate, educational courses.</p>\n<p>As far as he knows, this is the only time the classes will be offered, as Mitchell knows of no one who would be interested in taking over the class once he graduates.</p>\n<p>Mitchell hopes these courses will show students not only that music education can be an advantageous career path but also that they have the capability of being successful in whatever they choose to do in the future.</p>\n<p>“Music’s not worthless at all. I want people to embark on that,” Mitchell said. “I just care about influencing people to do the best in what they want to do.”</p>\n<p>After graduating, Mitchell plans to obtain a masters degree in music education and return to his alma mater in Stockton to teach music and composition in hip-hop production.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Nov. 15 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

id=\"caption-attachment-84666\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A 3-D model of Henley Hall shows one of the sides of the building. <em>Courtesy of Henley Hall Model YouTube video</em></p></div>\n<p>Henley Hall, named after its donors Jeff and Judy Henley, will be the new headquarters for the Institute for Energy Efficiency (IEE). It will serve as home to a lecture hall, 17 labs, faculty and administrative offices and a three-story open-air atrium.</p>\n<p>The IEE focuses on the creation of new technologies and methods of energy conservation and sustainability, according to the UCSB Housing, Dining and Auxiliary Enterprises website.</p>\n<p>Henley will be the largest hall at UCSB to date with an estimated at 49,000 gross square feet. It is now in the initial stages of development.</p>\n<p>It will be designed to reduce its water and energy usage, along with its emissions.</p>\n<p>“[Henley Hall] is an outgrowth of our high-priority need for lab and teaching space, and also a recognition of UC Santa Barbara’s leadership in cutting-edge research on energy efficiency,” Leslie Colasse, project manager for Henley Hall, said.</p>\n<p>Henley is designed to maximize space and minimize the carbon footprint the building creates, according to the UCSB Design, Facilities and Safety Services website.</p>\n<p>The building will be composed of mostly steel and concrete with terracotta roof paneling and spires to promote natural shade and cooling.</p>\n<p>Henley is entirely donor funded, with a $56 million budget provided by the Henleys and various other anonymous donors.</p>\n<p>The idea for the new hall came about due to growing class size, restrictive lecture hall capacity and the Institute’s growing impact on the UCSB campus, according to Associated Students (A.S.) President Brooke Kopel.</p>\n<p>“I think it is pretty apparent on campus that there is a shortage of classroom space. The amount of resources UCSB is given, there is still students sitting on the floor… Students [are] taking midterms on floors and that just entirely unacceptable,” Kopel said.</p>\n<p>News of Henley first reached the A.S. Main Office after complaints came in about blocked off bike paths around Campbell Hall, she added.</p>\n<p>Henley Hall and the IEE will be the Henleys’s largest gift to UCSB. The Henleys have been involved with the UCSB campus since the early 2000s.</p>\n<p>“Because I spent the majority of my career in the technology industry, my wife and I have been drawn to the terrific STEM programs… at UC Santa Barbara which have achieved national prominence over the decades,” Jeff Henley said in an email.</p>\n<p>“We realized that more and more laboratory space will be critical to attracting and retaining the best faculty as well as the best students for STEM, so this is primarily why we decided to support [Henley Hall].”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div
