In 1937, he was hired as head coach of the UCSB men’s basketball team. During his 20-year tenure, Coach Wilton totaled a record of 205-163, which still stands as the best winning percentage by any head coach in UCSB history at .557. Although Wilton has passed on, his children, Mike and Wendy, will accept his induction to the Court of Champions.</p>\n<p>Joining Coach Wilton will be one of his former players from UCSB, Gene Snyder. Following his time as a player, Snyder became one of the most successful basketball coaches in Santa Barbara High School’s history, leading the Dons to a total record of 104-77 in eight seasons.</p>\n<p>Lowell Steward is another former player who will be ushered in with the 2015 class. He became the school’s first African-American captain and helped lead UCSB to the semifinals of the NAIA tournament, where he was not permitted to play due to segregation issues. In late 2014, Steward passed on due to illness. His son Lowell Jr. will accept his induction.</p>\n<p>A UCSB alum as well, Coach Jim Eyan will be the final male inductee. Former assistant coach at Santa Barbara City College for four years and head coach of Dos Pueblos High School for a season, Eyan then served as an assistant coach for five years at UCSB. He then transitioned to the professional level. In his time, he has experienced an NBA finals with the Lakers and two Western Conference Championships with the Trailblazers.</p>\n<p>The Court of Champions will also welcome two women, Cori Close and Barb Beainy, who were teammates on UCSB’s women’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>A four-year starting point guard, Close is the first Gaucho to record a career total of 1000 points and 500 assists. After graduating, she went on to become an assistant under UCSB Head Coach Mark French for nine years. As Head Coach of UCLA’s women’s basketball team, Close recently led the Bruins to a championship victory in the WNIT tournament this past season and holds an overall career record of 72-60.</p>\n<p>Close’s former teammate Beainy was awarded Big West Player of the Year and Clutch Player of the Year in 1992, when the team won its first ever Big West title. Following her outstanding career, Beainy now serves as the Director of UCSB’s Wellness and Fitness program in Exercise and Sports Studies.</p>\n<p>“UCSB has been a huge part of the Santa Barbara community on multiple levels and we are thankful to have them in the area,” Pickering said. “UCSB Basketball has provided entertainment for the community, an outlet and bridge for our youth, and the school itself shapes and develops so many of the young people in our area.”</p>\n<p>Along with these six inductees, another 11 who have embraced huge roles in both the Santa Barbara and basketball communities will be honored this Sunday evening as well.

That may be the oldest sports cliché in the book; however, it has rung true over and over again as the teams that are playing their best come playoff time tend to fare well and make it the farthest. That trend has not been consistent in the 2015 NHL Playoffs as the season-long juggernauts have flexed their muscles and knocked out some of the hottest teams in the league like the Minnesota Wild and the Ottawa Senators. While the Ducks and the Blackhawks have already wrapped things up out west, the Eastern conference remains up for grabs as the Capitals and the Rangers will need game seven and Carey Price is willing the Canadiens back into Montreal’s series after falling behind 3-0 to Tampa Bay.  Recap:</p>\n<p><b>Washington Capitals vs. New York Rangers (Tied 3-3)</b>– Alexander Ovechkin put the Capitals on his back this series and carried them to a 3-1 lead over the Rangers. That is when the offense clicked and a Henrik Lundqvist with his back against the wall is a dangerous Henrik Lundqvist. Two straight wins have tied the series and brought it back to New York for a pivotal game seven. There are so many different factors that will affect Wednesday’s game and it will ultimately become a battle of who shows up and who does not. Braden Holtby has been vulnerable in the last two games, allowing six goals over that span while his offense has provided him only three goals of support; none of those from Alex Ovechkin. While Alex Ovechkin and Henrik Lundqvist headline this series, I believe that it will be up to Braden Holtby and the Capitals defense to shut down the Rangers if they want to have any chance of moving on.</p>\n<p><b>Anaheim Ducks vs. Calgary Flames (Ducks win 4-1)-</b> The Ducks seem to be on a mission this postseason as they overpowered the Flames with size and experience to cruise to a 4-1 series victory. This series taught us a lot about both Anaheim and Calgary. We learned that Anaheim has the depth and high-octane offense to make a serious charge at Chicago next round and reach the Stanley Cup. We also learned that Calgary may not have had the firepower to win this year, but they will be back and back with a vengeance. Johnny Gaudreau looked poised and dangerous after being benched in the second period of game two and the sky is the limit for the rookie. Not to mention its hard not to imagine what this team could have done with a healthy Mark Giordano. Anaheim Head Coach Bruce Boudreau has already pegged Chicago “the fastest team in the NHL”, which is going to test the versatile defense of the Ducks. If Frederik Andersen can match Corey Crawford in goal then the Ducks have a serious chance to take this series.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Nbk86c29uI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><b>Chicago Blackhawks vs. Minnesota Wild (Blackhawks win 4-0)- </b>Just a few weeks ago, no one in their right mind would have chosen Corey Crawford to beat Devan Dubnyk in a goalie battle; however, that was the case in this series as it was all Blackhawks all the time. Crawford was magnificent all series and after being benched in the opening series for Chicago, he made the most of this opportunity giving up only seven goals in four games to a high-powered Minnesota offense. The Wild deserve all the credit in the world for even making it to where they did, as no one expected them to make a charge into the postseason, let alone defeat Stanley Cup favorites St. Louis. That is exactly what Mike Yeo did and with a historic second half of the season for Devan Dubnyk, the Wild were able to dominate the NHL and rapidly climb up the standings. Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville has not been shy in praising the talented Anaheim Ducks and knows that his team will have their hands full in the next round. Patrick Kane is playing like the best player in the posteason right now and if he keeps scoring at his current pace, no one will be able to stop Chicago.</p>\n<p><b>Tampa Bay Lightning vs. Montreal Canadiens (Tampa Bay 3-2)</b>-Fresh off of a bruising seven game series against Detroit, no one expected Tampa Bay to come out and play the way they did against Montreal. The Canadiens had far more rest and still found themselves behind 3-0 to the Lightning and scrambling for answers. Carey Price has been the answer for this team all season long and he has responded with two great games to keep Montreal afloat. The offense of the Canadiens cannot be overlooked as they have scored eight goals in their last two games and seem to be putting things together at the right time. Is it too little too late though? Steven Stamkos and the deadly offense of the Lightning will look to stop their mini-skid and move on to the Eastern Conference finals on Tuesday. I believe that the Lightning will wrap it up at home, but if they take it to game seven then they will be in a bad position playing on the road with very little momentum.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63324\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-12/nhl-playoffs-getting-hot-at-the-right-time/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63324\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-12/nhl-playoffs-getting-hot-at-the-right-time/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-12/nhl-playoffs-getting-hot-at-the-right-time/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-12/nhl-playoffs-getting-hot-at-the-right-time/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-12/nhl-playoffs-getting-hot-at-the-right-time/","id":2024,"author":{"id":321,"name":"Jack Mathews"},"related":[2023,2022,2021],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NBA Offseason: Where Will LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony End Up?","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony opting out of their contracts, questions arise as to where the two stars will end up. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>There is no doubt at all that these next couple of months will belong to LeBron James. As of yesterday, the King decided to opt out of his contract with the Miami Heat and test the market of free agency, and everyone will follow the crown. This two-time champion and four-time MVP is certainly the player that any team would love to land in hopes of bringing the Larry O’Brien Trophy to their town.</p>\n<p>Although James has opted out, this does not mean he will be leaving the Miami Heat. James could easily re-sign with the Heat but of course with a new, higher salary. Surely, the King is worth the money, but it would be a complicated situation in trying to afford all of the All-Stars that grace the Miami franchise. James will keep an eye on the moves that the Heat makes in the offseason to make his final decision, but he will also welcome offers from other squads in the end. In this current time, James has two main options: stay or return.</p>\n<p>Ironically, the Cleveland Cavaliers have been blessed by James, taking his talents to South Beach. Since “The Decision,” the Cavs have been given three number-one picks in the draft and other top-five picks as well in just a few years. If they were to start the player that they draft this year, they would have five young athletes with a lot of potential, but no real leader.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Cavs have a lot of power with their pick this year and the players they have taken before, and they can use this to an extreme advantage. If they were to deal out some player and make cap room, they could ultimately bring James back to his first throne in Ohio.</p>\n<p>The King has wanted to bring a championship back to the homeland since he was drafted and now he has a second shot. With point guard Kyrie Irving and the rights to this year’s No. 1 draft pick, we would surely see an exciting Cavs team to watch and James’s legacy would truly be complete.</p>\n<p>The choice that would be better than James going back home would be to stay in Miami. He just opted out of playing for a team that has been to four straight NBA Finals, in which his team won half. Yes, the fact that he lost two does taint his reputation, but he’s still LeBron James.</p>\n<p>A team going to four straight championship rounds has been unheard of since the Magic and Bird era, and this band of stars pulled it off. Miami is truly the place where James has the greatest chance of success. If the old gang stays together, they have a chance at winning a couple more rings, but not five… or six… or seven.</p>\n<p>Aside from James, another star has hit the market as well. New York Knicks small forward Carmelo Anthony will possibly look for a new arena to play in this upcoming season.</p>\n<p>They say that it is hard to get superstars to play well together for an entire season and the Knicks were a perfect example of this. With former player Derek Fisher coming in as coach, I can’t see a title coming anytime soon and neither could Melo. Now in pursuit of a ring, and not a wad of cash, he has two very valuable options to look at.</p>\n<p>First is the one that people have been buzzing about since the season ended: Chicago. This team has continued to be consistent and a dominant defensive powerhouse throughout the last couple of seasons. Even with former MVP Derrick Rose sitting out nearly two full seasons and Luol Deng moving to Cleveland, the Bulls have still been a name in the Eastern Conference.</p>\n<p>The team’s defensive play has been enough to carry them to victories without Rose, but their offense has struggled to the point where D.J. Augustin became their first scoring option. In comes Melo and this is a completely different offense.</p>\n<p>Rose’s success and effectiveness is unclear with this franchise at this point, and Anthony is someone that they can rely on to take the shots. If Rose were to return and possibly accept a role as a facilitator, he could use his slashing skills to his and Melo’s advantage while still getting his own buckets.</p>\n<p>Another possible home for Carmelo would be Houston. He would join a band of strong offensive players and an already well-suited program that just lacks a bit of direction. The Rockets have all of the tools they need in James Harden up top, Dwight Howard down low and a now-proven Chandler Parsons supporting them.</p>\n<p>Adding Melo into the mix could be dangerous, going back to making stars play well together, but the Heat was able to do it twice and these guys would have the same level of talent with Anthony on their squad.</p>\n<p>This could be the more likely spot due to Chicago’s latest move. The word surrounding the Bulls now is the hot trade option in Minnesota Timberwolf, Kevin Love. To acquire the double-double machine, the Bulls have been said to give away possibly Taj Gibson, Tony Snell and both of their first round picks.</p>\n<p>They are certainly on top of Minnesota’s K-Love option, along with the Warriors who could be looking to dish Klay Thompson. There are plenty more agents to keep an eye on this season and, with a fantastic draft class coming in, this will surely be an exciting off-season.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared in June 24, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55856\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/nba-offseason-where-will-lebron-james-and-carmelo-anthony-end-up/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55856\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/nba-offseason-where-will-lebron-james-and-carmelo-anthony-end-up/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/nba-offseason-where-will-lebron-james-and-carmelo-anthony-end-up/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/nba-offseason-where-will-lebron-james-and-carmelo-anthony-end-up/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/nba-offseason-where-will-lebron-james-and-carmelo-anthony-end-up/","id":2026,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[2025,2024,2023],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2015 NFL Rule Changes: New Rules Add New Flavor","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"NFL owners agree on rule changes that will go into effect for the 2015 season","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-5-27-21.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1098905170\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"63907\"><img data-attachment-id=\"63913\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/2015-nfl-rule-changes-new-rules-add-new-flavor/2015-5-27-21/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-5-27-21.jpg?fit=1400%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1400,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2015 5 27 2(1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-5-27-21.jpg?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-5-27-21.jpg?fit=888%2C634&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft  wp-image-63913\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-5-27-21.jpg?resize=636%2C454\" alt=\"2015 5 27 2(1)\" width=\"636\" height=\"454\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-5-27-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;ssl=1 1400w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-5-27-21.jpg?resize=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-5-27-21.jpg?resize=1024%2C731&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>The 2014 NFL season was a complete rollercoaster ride for Commissioner Roger Goodell.

Instead, he has remained composed and seems to be committed to improving the future of the NFL. Three rules concerning the distance of the Point After Touchdown, known as the “P.A.T.,” and two-point conversion regulations were adjusted.</p>\n<p>The P.A.T. will no longer be kicked from the two-yard line, but will now be attempted from the 15-yard line. Formerly a 20-yard kicking try, the change in range now sets kickers up with a 32-yard extra-point attempt.</p>\n<p>Still, this adjustment is not a definite change as its success within actual game situations has yet to be tested. The restructuring of the P.A.T. will start off as a one-year trial. Depending on its impact, owners will have the chance to vote for or against the rule in the NFL’s following offseason.</p>\n<p>Finally joining college football in use of the same rule, defenses can now return turnovers that occur during an offense’s two-point conversion attempt for a score of two-points. Since the addition of the two-point conversion to the NFL in 1994, a turnover always resulted in a dead play with no points for the defense. Unchanged is the distance of the two-point conversion as it will remain on the two-yard line.</p>\n<p>Since the two-point conversion is already a short distance away from the end zone, this rule is not problematic. Promoting the use of the two-point conversion should attract more football fans, but making the play easier could potentially become a standard score for offenses.</p>\n<p>While other rule proposals await for team owners to discuss and settle on, these new changes are encouraging in the NFL’s progression.</p>\n<p>The change in the P.A.T. will definitely increase the entertainment level of the sport as kickers will face a more challenging 32-yard attempt. Prior to this rule change, the 20-yard point after effort was a routine score that usually was followed with a commercial.</p>\n<p>The P.A.T. not being an automatic extra point after a team scores a touchdown will make games more intriguing. It forces coaches to make gutsier play calls in crucial, sometimes win or lose situations which allows the game to become more enjoyable for fans.</p>\n<p>Kickers may not appreciate extending the P.A.T. distance now, but it elevates the importance of their position. Kickers are commonly underappreciated due to the fact that they can be replaced so easily, especially when scoring an extra point from the two-yard line is such an effortless task.</p>\n<p>Moving the P.A.T. to the 32-yard line makes the point after attempt more appealing as it increases the amount of pressure on the kicker. It is a chance for kickers to remind everyone of their importance on the field.</p>\n<p>We have all known the two-point conversion attempt to be an unexpected, surprise play call. With these rule changes, does this mean that the anticipation of two-point conversions will possibly detract from its spontaneity? Without a conclusive answer, we will all have to wait and see if the change will help or hurt the game.</p>\n<p>Certainly, giving defenses the opportunity to score off of failed two-point conversion attempts may be the greatest adjustment made. It enhances the intensity of late-game situations in which defenses gain the chance of being game changers. Which is only acceptable since “defense wins championships,” right?</p>\n<p>Imagine a return of an interception, fumble recovery or blocked field goal attempt of a two-point conversion try being the difference in a team winning or sending a game into overtime. These are the types of bizarre scenarios that have given college football a slight entertainment advantage over the NFL. Giving defenses the chance to benefit from causing turnovers is another possibility for the NFL to become more amusing.</p>\n<p>Although many blame Commissioner Goodell for a lack of professionalism and responsibility during the 2014 NFL season, the NFL and NFLPA’s effort to improve the game of football is refreshing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 28, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63907\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/2015-nfl-rule-changes-new-rules-add-new-flavor/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63907\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/2015-nfl-rule-changes-new-rules-add-new-flavor/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/2015-nfl-rule-changes-new-rules-add-new-flavor/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/2015-nfl-rule-changes-new-rules-add-new-flavor/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/2015-nfl-rule-changes-new-rules-add-new-flavor/","id":2025,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[2024,2023,2022],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
