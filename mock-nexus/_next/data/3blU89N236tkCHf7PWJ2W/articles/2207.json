Individuals from all ten UC campuses and their respective medical centers are marching in protest.</p>\n<p>Since AFSCME representatives are spread across the state, their presence at UCSB wasn’t as large as the previous workers’ strike this past May, according to Cierra Sorin, Graduate Student Association (GSA) president.</p>\n<p>“The purpose today is to send a clear message about consciousness and awareness, and to spread our voices about what we want the university to know,” said Juan Donato, head groundskeeper at UCSB and AFSCME strike organizer.</p>\n<p>Employees across UCSB showed their support for the strike throughout the week.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“We demand their labor and then demean them for that kind of labor. And it’s really hypocritical and really elitist.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jay Stemmle, Student Academic Skills Specialist for Campus Learning Assistant Services (CLAS), spoke during the rally on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>“This is what my boss wrote to me yesterday: ‘Jay, not showing up for your scheduled shift is not protected speech… If you fail to report to work, it will be considered insubordination/serious misconduct, and your actions will be subject to discipline.’”</p>\n<p>Because of this, she decided to further research the rights of the employees who are on strike.</p>\n<p>She found that as long an an employee’s contract does not explicitly condemn participating in solidarity strikes, then striking is within their legal right, according to SCIU vs. Fresno In Home Supportive Services Authority from 2015.</p>\n<p>Stemmle told the crowd about this decision, hoping to educate UCSB employees who were unaware of their rights.</p>\n<p>“If [there are] other people in that situation, I want us to be able to find each other, strategize, talk to each other, get each other the help we need,” she said.</p>\n<p>Cathy Murillo, mayor of Santa Barbara, spoke at the rally on Wednesday afternoon in support of AFSCME’s action against UCSB.</p>\n<p>Murillo emphasized her personal connection to the strike as she spoke — her grandmother worked in the garment district in Los Angeles and was an organizer for the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union.</p>\n<p>“You deserve a salary that respects the hard work that you do. I’ll send some little fairy-vibes up to the Regents, for them to look at the good people here, and give you a good contract, the contract you deserve. I’m here for you today, folks,” she said.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"84533\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/afscme-protests-ucs-lack-of-action-during-second-day-of-strike-hundreds-show-up-in-support/screen-shot-2018-10-25-at-12-13-09-am-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?fit=1916%2C1267&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1916,1267\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2018-10-25 at 12.13.09 AM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?fit=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?fit=888%2C587&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84533\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?resize=888%2C587\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"587\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?w=1916&amp;ssl=1 1916w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?resize=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?resize=768%2C508&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?resize=1024%2C677&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?resize=980%2C647&amp;ssl=1 980w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-25-at-12.13.09-AM-1.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>Numerous student groups showed up to support the workers during the strike.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen five or six teaching assistants in my department, including some who are holding sections right now. I’ve seen a couple of our professors bring their classes out,” Sorin said.</p>\n<p>One of these TAs was Amanda Rodriguez, a second-year graduate student studying sociology with an emphasis in feminist studies. She brought her students to the rally on Wednesday to observe the strikers and ask questions.</p>\n<p>“As a GSA member, the GSA executive board stands firmly behind AFSCME, and as a United Auto Workers (UAW) member I stand firmly behind them, and UC needs to know we’re watching, we care, and we’re willing to mobilize on [AFSCME’s] behalf,” Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>The issue of workers’ rights carries personal significance for many students who marched on Tuesday and Wednesday, including Frances Olague, a third-year psychology major.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been coming to these ever since I was a little kid because my mom works for UC Berkeley. It’s really close to home since my mom is a UC worker, and I feel like with their petitions and everything, how it goes through affects my life as well,” Olague said.</p>\n<p>Despite the strong student support present throughout the strike, some students were still in opposition. Their criticism is often centered around the workers’ lack of higher education or seemingly self-chosen job choice.</p>\n<p>“There was definitely people that didn’t seem too happy with [the strike], but I was happy to be out here, and I was happy to see as many students as there was out here as well,” said June Mihalich, a sociology major in her last quarter.</p>\n<p>One post on UCSB’s Free &amp; For Sale group on Facebook mentioned a UCSB student telling the demonstrators to be quiet because she had midterms and yelling at them to “fuck off.”</p>\n<p>Dozens of commenters argued whether the girl’s reactions were valid.</p>\n<p>“We demand our McDonald’s so fast, but we shame those workers when they ask to at least be able to get a living wage. We demand their labor and then demean them for that kind of labor. And it’s really hypocritical and really elitist to say that,” Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>Leaders of the strike emphasized that it takes the combined action of students, employees and workers to make an impact that UCSB administrators cannot ignore.</p>\n<p>“As union workers, let’s stick together. Together, we will make this work, together we will win,” Donato said.</p>\n<p>The AFSCME strike will continue on Thursday, Oct. 25 until 6 p.m. at Storke Tower.</p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.1 of the Oct. 25 print edition of the</i> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Elections Board initially mandated a special election for the EVPSA position to take place in Fall Quarter 2018 after Mayela Morales, a current fifth-year global studies and Chicanx studies double major, was disqualified approximately three weeks after the Spring Quarter 2018 elections were held. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Declaration of Candidacy period for the EVPSA special election officially ended on Oct. 2, leaving Madeline Loudon, the runner-up in the Spring Quarter 2018 EVPSA election, as the only candidate in the race. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final deadline to vote was extended multiple times, as the special election was repeatedly unable to meet the voter threshold. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final deadline to vote ended Nov. 4, with the special election unable to meet the 16 percent threshold.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Nov. 4, A.S. Elections Board Chair John Paul Renteria </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-04/breaking-evpsa-seat-to-be-left-vacant-for-rest-of-academic-year/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">confirmed </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">there will be no EVPSA for the 2018-19 school year following.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Nov. 8, Elections Board held a meeting in which Davis Quan, Elections Board member, motioned to hold a special election during Winter Quarter 2019 for the EVPSA position, citing that it would follow A.S. Legal Code, according to Elections Board minutes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If an executive officer position should become vacant after the fifth (5th) meeting of Fall Quarter, an election must be held by the fourth (4th) week of Winter quarter,” according to Article 11, section 2, (A.1.1) in A.S. Legal Code.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Elections Board held another meeting on Nov. 13, in which Elections Board member Andrew Yan motioned to set the voter threshold for the winter special election to 10 percent, according to Elections Board minutes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Quan stated that since the threshold for a General Election is 20%, a special election voter threshold for one position should be half of that,” the Elections Board minutes read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Wednesday’s A.S. Senate meeting, Elections Board Chair John Paul Renteria presented the petition to hold a special election during Winter Quarter 2019 for the EVPSA position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Elections Board’s minutes, Election’s Board would have begun advertising for the special election after the petition was approved by A.S. Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Wednesday’s A.S. Senate meeting, Renteria said he believed the threshold of 10 percent is obtainable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In June, A.S. Senate passed a resolution temporarily splitting the position’s funds and duties between the External Vice President for Local Affairs, the Student Advocate General, the A.S. President, the A.S. President Proxy and the Lobby Corps Co-Chairs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A letter from UC Student Association President Caroline Siegel Singh and Chair Davon Brandon Thomas said this vacancy is “deeply concerning and signals a lack of understanding of exactly how vital this position is to the UC Santa Barbara student body.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Due to the vacancy, UCSB students have already missed 2 of the quarterly meetings with UC President Janet Napolitano and her staff,” the letter continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is often during these meetings that EVPs are tasked with bringing up major campus issues to be addressed by the Office of the President.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The letter was voted on by the External Vice Presidents from every UC, their office staff and the board as a whole, according to the EVPSA office’s Campus Organizing Director Alexandra Gessesse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To be honest, we’re going to keep doing the same work. But what will the office look like to the larger state of California, I don’t know,” Gessesse said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an injustice to students’ needs and concerns beyond the absence of an executive member.”</span></p>\n<p>The full UCSA letter can be read <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ucsb-letter.pdf\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

They’re sitting here and they’re just putting stuff together,” he said.</p>\n<p>He added that while hip-hop has become more accessible to more people, some of the core elements of the genre have been compromised in the process.</p>\n<p>Sociology of Hip-Hop will discuss these types of paradoxes in the genre as well as changes in the messages, sounds and producers of hip-hop.</p>\n<p>“I’m really testing the boundaries of, like, what is modern hip-hop,” he said. “How does hip-hop go from poor people to what we’re seeing as rich people music?”</p>\n<p>Mitchell wants students to come out of the class having adequate knowledge about the social context of modern hip-hop as well as how to think critically about hip-hop, its producers and why it looks and sounds the way it does today.</p>\n<p>Discussion topics in Sociology of Hip-Hop will include stigmas, dichotomies of masculinity and femininity, sexualization and desexualization and LGBTQ+ artists and issues, according to Mitchell.</p>\n<p>“I’m gonna give you information and I want you to be able critically assess how do you feel and what do you agree with, what don’t you agree with, what do you know about hip-hop,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>Mitchell has been workshopping these courses since his first year at UCSB, when the idea to teach a course at UCSB in hip-hop first dawned on him.</p>\n<p>After teaching a hip-hop course at Los Prietos Boys Camp in his freshman year and later teaching a hip-hop class at Santa Barbara City College, Mitchell decided the topic was something that students at UCSB could also benefit from.</p>\n<p>“Hip-hop is actually very complex and complicated. It’s also very hands-on. People can learn that,” he said.</p>\n<p>Mitchell said the legitimacy of hip-hop as a serious musical genre is sometimes undermined by beliefs about it being too simple and too distant from the pillars of music theory. He expects there to be some criticisms of the hip-hop classes from colleagues and faculty once the class begins.</p>\n<p>“I have people that will love the class in the music department … and then a lot of people will for sure hate it and don’t like that it’s intentionally going away from Western pedagogies on purpose and intentionally not doing what my teacher taught me,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>These courses are offered through a program that allows students in the College of Creative Studies to teach a course during their time at UCSB. Students in the program must present syllabi and teaching plans for the course before they are approved to teach it, according to Mitchell.</p>\n<p>Mitchell worked on his plans for the courses throughout summer, having to make many changes throughout the process and prove the classes to be legitimate, educational courses.</p>\n<p>As far as he knows, this is the only time the classes will be offered, as Mitchell knows of no one who would be interested in taking over the class once he graduates.</p>\n<p>Mitchell hopes these courses will show students not only that music education can be an advantageous career path but also that they have the capability of being successful in whatever they choose to do in the future.</p>\n<p>“Music’s not worthless at all. I want people to embark on that,” Mitchell said. “I just care about influencing people to do the best in what they want to do.”</p>\n<p>After graduating, Mitchell plans to obtain a masters degree in music education and return to his alma mater in Stockton to teach music and composition in hip-hop production.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Nov. 15 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
