The Gauchos managed to put the tying run on second with 2 outs in the inning, but Reinke struck out Jennifer Johnston to end the game. The loss extended the Gaucho losing streak to three games.</p>\n<p>In the Gauchos’ Friday night game against San Jose State, their losing streak was extended to four games as the Spartans crushed Santa Barbara 12-3.</p>\n<p>The nine run margin is the largest deficit UCSB has endured since playing Texas A&amp;M earlier in the season. San Jose starter Chantrelle Ladner pitched a complete game, giving up three runs on seven hits in seven innings, while striking out six to pick up her fourth win of the year.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, second baseman Arianna Palomares and DP Jacqueline Hinojosa each collected two hits apiece in the game. The Gauchos scored all three of their runs in the second inning. The three runs were tallied by Palomares, senior Samantha Stark, and freshman Melanie Menor.</p>\n<p>San Jose’s powerful lineup took its toll on the Gauchos’ pitching staff, as it recorded 12 hits on the day, with home runs by outstanding sophomore outfielder Brittany Abacherli and infielder Arissa Pinedo.  Abacherli went 2-4 with three RBI’s, while Pinedo knocked in four RBI’s with two runs scored.  Gaucho starter Ashley Ludlow lasted only one inning, giving up four earned runs while striking out two.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ weekend only got worse when it took on the BYU Cougars on Saturday morning, losing 8-0 in just five innings. BYU starting pitcher McKenna Bull deserved all the attention in this one as she threw a masterful five inning no-hitter.  This was Bull’s second no-hitter of the year as she gave up just one walk.</p>\n<p>She struck out seven Gauchos in the game, striking out the side in the fifth to close it out. Cougar DP Madison Merrell went 2-3 in the game with a home run and four RBI’s.</p>\n<p>The UCSB pitching staff seemed to run out of steam when it allowed five runs in the fifth inning, all off Gulvin who had replaced Ludlow in relief.  Ludlow had a tough day giving up five earned runs in four innings.</p>\n<p>The only Gaucho baserunner in the game came on a walk to Altmeyer leading off the second inning.  However, she was left stranded at first base as the Gauchos simply couldn’t find contact at the plate against Bull’s pitching.</p>\n<p>Riding a five game losing streak, UCSB managed to turn things around in its Saturday afternoon game against Colorado State. After facing them the day before, the Gauchos knew what it would take to get a win, and that’s to score early as they won the game 11-7 in a slugfest.  Santa Barbara scored six runs in the third to break open its lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were paced by center fielder Stacy Cavazos who hit a home run and finished with four RBI’s. Second basemen Arianna Palomares also hit a home run and drove in two runs. Right fielder Jessica Johnston went 4-5 at the plate with two runs scored.</p>\n<p>In addition, Altmeyer and third basemen Emily Brucelas each had 2 RBI’s a piece.</p>\n<p>Gaucho sophomore starting pitcher Lena Mayer picked up her fifth win on the year, scattering seven hits and four runs while striking out two.</p>\n<p>Rams’ starter Bridgette Hutton took her fifth loss of the season after giving up six runs on five hits in just two innings while striking out one batter.</p>\n<p>In Sunday’s game, the Gauchos took on San Diego State again and lost in heartbreaking fashion 6-5 on a walk-off solo homer by Aztec third baseman Molly Sturdivant leading off the bottom of the seventh. It was Sturdivant’s only hit in the game.</p>\n<p>The game started out well for the Gauchos as they scored three runs in the first inning capped by a two-run homer from second baseman Emily Brucelas.</p>\n<p>Kristen Clark led off the inning with a single, and she was sacrificed to second by Palomares. While facing two outs, Altmeyer doubled home Palomares, followed by the Brucelas home run to make it a 3-0 Gauchos’ lead. Santa Barbara added an unearned run in the second to make it 4-0 and registered its fifth run in the sixth inning.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs battled back however, with two runs in the second and a run in the fifth before tying it at five all with two more runs in the sixth on three hits when San Diego brought 9 batters to the plate.</p>\n<p>In the top of the seventh, the Gauchos rallied, putting two runners on base.  They got as far as third base with two outs before UCSB’s opportunity to possibly score ended on a flyout to centerfield off the bat of Stacy Cavazos.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were led by Brucelas and shortstop Melanie Menor in the losing effort.</p>\n<p>Brucelas went 2-4 in the game with the home run and two RBI’s, while Menor went 3-3 at the plate with a run scored.  Also contributing for UCSB was Clark who had two hits, two runs scored and an RBI.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had 13 hits in the game. Starting pitcher Ashley Ludlow pitched well for the Gauchos giving up just three earned runs in 5.2 innings while scattering eight hits and striking out two.  Veronika Gulvin came on in relief in the 7<sup>th</sup> and took the loss.</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to rebound next weekend when it returns home to host the Gaucho Classic II, and will take on Bakersfield, Seattle, Santa Clara and San Diego once again.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69056\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/slow-start-ends-with-ucsbs-lone-victory-at-san-diego-classic-ii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69056\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/slow-start-ends-with-ucsbs-lone-victory-at-san-diego-classic-ii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/slow-start-ends-with-ucsbs-lone-victory-at-san-diego-classic-ii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/slow-start-ends-with-ucsbs-lone-victory-at-san-diego-classic-ii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/slow-start-ends-with-ucsbs-lone-victory-at-san-diego-classic-ii/","id":1139,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1138,1137,1136],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird","biography":"Not available","articles":[48,49,50,51,59,60,62,63,1118,1120,1123,1137,1138,1139,1140,1141,1142,1143,1144,1145,1148,1150,1176,1177,1178,1179,1183,1403,1406,1407,1410,1419,1421,1425,1426,1434,1436,1437,1444,1445,1447,1448,1449,1450,1451,1452,1455,1490,1494,1927,1928],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Look To Impress Home Crowd This Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-04-at-1.46.10-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-04-at-1.46.10-PM.png?resize=892%2C583&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB Gauchos will be playing the University of New Mexico Lobos on Sunday, March 5.

The pitching staff is anchored by junior McKenna Bull who is 11-7 on the year with a 3.77 ERA and an outstanding 148 strikeouts in 119 innings.</p>\n<p>In Saturday afternoon’s game, Santa Barbara will play Colorado State at 2:00 p.m. The Rams come into the weekend with an overall record of 9-11 on the season, but are currently playing well as they have won 6 out of their last 7 games.</p>\n<p>The Rams are led by junior shortstop Haley Hutton who was just named the Mountain West Softball Player of the Week on March 8. She’s hitting .475 on the season and leads the team in runs scored with 19.</p>\n<p>Colorado’s ace pitcher is senior Holly Reinke who carries a 2.90 ERA, with 43 strikeouts and a 6-5 record into this weekend’s tournament action.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos close-out the Classic on Sunday afternoon with a game against San Diego State at 2:00 p.m.  The Aztecs are a healthy 13-9 on the season, and after a 6 game winning streak in February, have gone 5-5 over their last ten games.</p>\n<p>The pitching staff carries a solid team ERA of 3.31 lad by staff ace junior Erica Romero with a 3.37 ERA and a 7-4 record.</p>\n<p>The Aztec lineup features sophomore catcher Jenavee Peres who leads the team in hitting with a .444 average and also leads with 5 home runs and 15 runs scored.  Red shirt freshman utility player Katie Byrd also contributes with a .362 average and a team leading 15 RBI’s.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to improve upon their solid record in the San Deigo Classic II which is set to start Friday, March 18th at 11:30 am against Colorado State at the SDSU Softball Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69048\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-17/ucsb-looks-to-keep-improving-at-san-diego-classic-ii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69048\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-17/ucsb-looks-to-keep-improving-at-san-diego-classic-ii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-17/ucsb-looks-to-keep-improving-at-san-diego-classic-ii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-17/ucsb-looks-to-keep-improving-at-san-diego-classic-ii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-17/ucsb-looks-to-keep-improving-at-san-diego-classic-ii/","id":1138,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1137,1136,1135],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Simmers Down at Louisville Slugger Invitational","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-03-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/softball2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/softball2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Having won eight of its last 10 games, the UCSB softball team was unable to continue its streak with a 1-2 finish at the Louisville Slugger Invitational this past weekend.

\r\n</script> \n<p>In Friday’s game, the Gauchos got off to a great batting start against Utah Valley, scoring all of its eight runs in the first four innings.</p>\n<p>Freshman infielder Sierra Altmeyer sparked the rally in the first inning with a two out double to center field, helping bring in sophomore outfielder Jessica Johnston from first for a score. In the third inning, Altmeyer doubled again to score Johnston, who had singled and stole second. Altmeyer went 2-2 on the day at the plate and finished with two doubles, two RBI’s and was walked twice.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos scored three more runs in the fourth without a single hit, as junior outfielder Kristen Clark and senior infielder Arianna Palomares both scored on bases loaded walks by Utah Valley pitchers.</p>\n<p>Gaucho freshman pitcher Veronika Gulvin pitched well through three innings, holding the Wolverines without a hit.  However, in the fourth, things began to unravel for UCSB as Utah Valley scored three runs on three hits.</p>\n<p>The string of hits and scores led to Santa Barbara sending pitcher Lena Mayer on the mound in exchange for Gulvin. Towards the game’s ending, Ashley Ludlow closed out the game with four strikeouts in 1.2 inning of relief to pick up her fourth win of the season.</p>\n<p>Despite its win the previous day, UCSB’s play declined in its matchup on Saturday as it was unable to score a single run off of Iowa State, losing 2-0.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had only four hits in the game, all from Clark. Although its offense lacked of its usual production, UCSB ended Saturday’s loss with a solid pitching performance as Gulvin and freshman pitcher Ashley Wright combined for just two unearned runs on five hits.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara came close to scoring in the first inning when Clark hit an infield single, eventually advancing to second on a sacrifice bunt by Palomares. However, that’s as far as the Cyclones would let her go as she couldn’t find her way to third.</p>\n<p>In the following game, the Gauchos lost to Mississippi State 5-2. The only two runs the Gauchos could score occurred during a rally in the third inning, in which consecutive singles and a sacrifice bunt put junior outfielder Stacy Cavazos and Clark into scoring position. A double into center field hit by Altmeyer brought both runners home.</p>\n<p>In attempt to bounce back from their loss earlier in the day, it looked hopeful for the Gauchos leading 2-1 in the third inning. But, that would be UCSB’s only lead of the game as Mississippi State got to starting pitcher Ashley Ludlow with four more runs in the sixth.</p>\n<p>Ludlow pitched a complete game while enduring her third loss of the season, giving up five runs, three of which were earned to go along with nine hits and five strikeouts.</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to improve on its performance in this weekend’s upcoming San Diego Classic II.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69017\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-13/ucsb-simmers-down-at-louisville-slugger-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69017\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-13/ucsb-simmers-down-at-louisville-slugger-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-13/ucsb-simmers-down-at-louisville-slugger-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-13/ucsb-simmers-down-at-louisville-slugger-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-13/ucsb-simmers-down-at-louisville-slugger-invitational/","id":1137,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1136,1135,1134],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
