F&amp;B) met Monday in the UCen State Street room to consider 10 funding requests from nine campus organizations.</p>\n<p>The committee began its meeting with $34,000 in Office of Student Life (OSL) funds, $6,665.26 in Senate unallocated, $45,000 in Student Initiated Outreach Program, $45,000 in Culture Weeks and Graduations, $27,000 for sports teams and $17,164 for academic teams. A.S. F&amp;B fully granted five requests, partially granted one request, tabled two requests and declined funding for one request.</p>\n<p>Kapatirang Pilipino (KP) requested $730 for Filipino Visibility Week, which begins Nov. 9 and will include an open-mic night, a parol (Filipino Christmas lantern) making workshop, a Justice for Filipino-Americans March in L.A., a carnival and Filipino cuisine throughout the week.</p>\n<p>A KP representative said the week’s events will portray the academic, cultural, social and political pillars of the organization.</p>\n<p>“We try to have events that really enforce the pillars of our organization, so we are here to ask for funding for our Filipino Visibility Week,” the representative said.</p>\n<p>The committee fully funded the group on the condition that the $160 initially requested for decorations and arts and crafts would be used solely for parol-making supplies.</p>\n<p>American Indian Student Mentor Association representatives Dayoung Yun and Marisol Alamillo requested $6,000 for their annual harvest festival.</p>\n<p>Yun said the annual festival is for native students and allies who are unable to go home for the holidays. According to Yun, the goal of the festival is to celebrate native identity and unite native students with their culture.</p>\n<p>“The event originated in 1975 when some native students couldn’t go home for Thanksgiving, so we began to offer an alternative for those students,” Yun said. “It’s a safe space for our native students and allies and every student is welcome to attend.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to table the request until next week to discuss the use of the organization’s one-time exception clause in the allocation of funds.</p>\n<p>Pi Sigma Rho representative Bharat Raman requested $170 for an outreach barbeque.</p>\n<p>Raman said the event is for potential members of the physics honors society.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of this event would be to interact with prospective new members, get people to join,” Raman said. “We’re speaking to freshman physics classes which have hundreds of students.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B Vice-Chair and third-year political science major Isabelle Ninh said the committee cannot fund “recruitment events.”</p>\n<p>“Since the event is for physics students with certain requirements, it is more of a recruitment event than an open-student event,” Ninh said.</p>\n<p>The committee voted unanimously to decline funding to the organization based on the nature of the event.</p>\n<p>Cultura Arts representative Marla Arciniega requested $705 to fund their annual Dia de los Muertos event.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to fully fund the event.</p>\n<p>Japanese Language Cafe representatives Kai Kawashina and Sheila Ho requested $98 to hold a Uri Uri workshop and karaoke night/potluck.</p>\n<p>Kawashina said the events are a way for American students learning about Japanese culture or language to interact with international students from Japan.</p>\n<p>“The students from Japan can teach the American students who are learning Japanese or Japanese culture,” Kawashina said. “It’s a community to learn about Japanese culture using Japanese language”</p>\n<p>The committee voted to bundle and fully fund the two events.</p>\n<p>UCSBreaking representatives Christina Chong, Chris Pom and Steven Hu requested $1,350 to host a breakdancing competition at UCSB. They requested $1050 for judges and DJs, and $300 for prize money.</p>\n<p>Hu said the event is a way the group to gain recognition as a breakdancing club.</p>\n<p>“It’s a great way to get people interested in our club and it allows us to expand our club,” Hu said.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to partially fund their request, excluding the prize money, because it is against precedent to allot prize money to an organization.</p>\n<p>Lambda Sigma Gamma requested $1,300 to hold a Mr. Greek Universe pageant to raise money for their national philanthropy: California Head Start Program. The event is open to all of Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>A Lambda Sigma Gamma student representative said the event is a way to encourage inter-Greek relations while raising money for a cause that helps young students across the state.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund the fundraiser event, under the condition that all UCSB would be free to participate and attend the event.</p>\n<p>Afrikan Black Coalition student representatives Gold Okafor and Odera Anakwenze requested $30,000 for an annual Afrikan Black Coalition Conference held on Feb. 12 to Feb. 14 that spans the whole UC system. It was last held at UCSB in 2007 with 400 people. This year, Afrikan Black Coalition anticipates 900 people will be in attendance.</p>\n<p>Okafor said the conference is a way for black students on campus to gather as a community and learn about the way their community interacts with the world. Students will also learn from prominent black public figures about future professional success. Student will learn about the theme of the event, “Planting the seeds of the future, planning our next steps.“</p>\n<p>“It’s really important that black people on our campus and anyone in our community feel welcome here and are able to see each other and really flourish,” Okafor said.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund the event, with $15,000 from the OSL funds and $15,000 from the Culture weeks and graduation funds for the Winter 2016 quarter.</p>\n<p>Health and Wellness Liaisons for the Residence Hall Association (RHA) Jose Magana and Paloma Hinojosa requested $2,474 to install condom dispensers in each of UCSB’s residential halls. Currently, students in the residence halls may obtain condoms by requesting them from their hall’s Safe Sex Peer or Residence Hall Advisors.</p>\n<p>Magana and Hinojosa said the goal of the dispensers would be to make condoms more accessible for the general student body and promote safer sex.</p>\n<p>“There’s a stigma for going to another person to get a condom, even the Safe Sex Peers, and we want to eliminate that stigma. We want to put the dispensers somewhere where all students will have access to them.”</p>\n<p>The committee had concerns about the safety of the dispensers, and voted to table the request indefinitely as A.S. representative works collaboratively with RHA to create a safer, more functional condom dispenser plan.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

The social offered free food and included a talk from UCSB’s new Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn. The TSA will host socials, workshops, a mentoring program and other events throughout Transfer Awareness Month in November.</p>\n<p>Office of Student Life Associate Dean of Students and Lecturer Don Lubach said now is the “greatest” time to be a transfer student at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I’ve worked with transfer students over the years, but, until the last couple of years, I haven’t seen transfer students really recognize their unique identity and get to know each faster,” Lubach said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biopsychology major Monica Luong said it can be difficult to establish friends as a transfer student.</p>\n<p>“Freshmen get to, like, live in dorms and they’re right next to each other, but if you’re a transfer student you might not be placed next to people your age,” Luong said, “There need to be more events just for transfer students because they feel older than everybody if they go to most social events.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year black studies major Javae Valentine said housing was an issue for her when she transferred to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to find housing. I feel like it’s a common thing that UCSB fucks up your housing,” Valentine said. “They messed up my housing so I didn’t have anywhere to live at first and I was mad about that, but after that it got pretty good. I love this school.”</p>\n<p>Third-year math major Travis McCahon said after he transferred he also felt frustrated at UCSB for its lack of communication between departments.</p>\n<p>“This school is awful at talking to itself, like the Financial Aid to the BARC office,” McCahon said. “I almost got kicked out of school because one said I was good and the other said I wasn’t, so that’s a bit of an issue.”</p>\n<p>TSA President and fourth-year psychology major Marilyn Garcia said transfer students have a negative stigma on campus.</p>\n<p>“It’s like you’re a third-year on paper but like a freshmen,” Garcia said, “And you have one day for orientation — that’s not enough to tell you about the different resources that we have here on campus.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said building a social network among transfer students will help alleviate challenges transfer students face.</p>\n<p>“I feel like we need to help transfer students out and we can do that, not just by having leaders like me and my exec board, but also by having a community,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>According to Klawunn, the school values its transfer students because of the experience they bring from other campuses.</p>\n<p>“You get here and you start to tell us things like ‘why does UCSB do that this way?’ instead of assuming that this is how everything should be,” Klawunn said. “That kind of perspective and that kind of insight helps us to run things better.”</p>\n<p>Klawunn said transfers contribute to the campus community by taking leadership roles.<br>\n“Another thing I’ve seen is that transfer students … are really good at taking on campus leadership, so we are here to help you figure out how you want to step into that leadership,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>TSA founder and fourth-year film and media studies major December Brown said she is optimistic the transfer student experience will improve this year, largely due to the coming Transfer Student Resource Center.</p>\n<p>“That’s going to be opening up in January and we have six new undergraduate positions, two new graduate student positions, a new transfer director and two new academic advisors to work in the centre,” Brown said. “So they’re pretty much going at it full throttle.”</p>\n<p>Brown said TSA hopes to increase the number of incoming transfer students accepted to UCSB in upcoming years.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to do mentorship programs with incoming community college students during their application period,” Brown said. “We’re going to be mentoring incoming students on personal statement, helping them choose classes.”</p>\n<p>Brown said the TSA will try to provide the resources the University does not have to help increase the amount of transfer students attending UCSB every year.</p>\n<p>“I believe we’re at 24 percent transfer students right now; we want to get to 33 percent as a part of Janet Napolitano’s transfer action report,” Brown said. “She wants to have 33 percent transfer students at every UC location, so we’re going to do that.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

School workshop Thursday evening in the Dolores Huerta Conference Room to share information on the resources available to first generation, underrepresented students pursuing graduate education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chican@ Studies Department peer advisors Carmen Mares and Beatriz Cano geared the workshop toward students of color, providing information about the application process to obtain a master’s degree or a Ph.D. The presentations provided an overview about applying for financial aid, studying for the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) and making connections with faculty members to get into a desired graduate program. Current graduate students discussed potential routes to graduate school and personal circumstances which motivated them to continue their education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third-year Chican@ studies and Black studies double major Veronica Mandujano said she was compelled to attend this workshop because she does not know anyone who has gone to graduate school prior to the workshop.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I just want to know every resource available to me,” Mandujano said. “I want to know who I can link up with, and who can offer me information when I need it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mandujano said the workshop offered several resources for attendees, including information about fellowships, paying for grad school and out-of-state schooling.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a great presentation and I learned a lot but mainly planning ahead, planning as much as much as you can … and the different types of grad schools that are available,” Mandujano said. “Speaking to current grad students was just kind of a more personal time to understand their experience.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chican@ studies teaching assistant Terri Cecchine said she went through the same experiences and felt it was her responsibility to relay information about the graduate school process to students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am the first in my family to pursue a Ph.D., to receive a masters, so when I was approached by Carmen and Betty, of course I wanted to help out,” Cecchine said. “I have to help those that are following in the path that I have carved out for myself, it’s not easy for everyone to get here and so now that we are here, it’s really important that we network and give back, and give our wisdom.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Cecchine, a low percentage of minority students acquire Ph.D.’s due to financial and social circumstances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like it’s really hard given the obstacles that a lot of people of color are born into – the lack of resources, lack of network, lack of peer support and lack of parental support,” Cecchine said. “For whatever reason, all of those things are prominent in white communities or communities that don’t have financial stipulations, so they are obviously given a lot more access to education.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chican@ studies department peer advisor Carmen Mares said she held the workshop because she would like more guidance in applying to graduate school, and felt many other students were in the same position.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a peer advisor here has helped me provide resources to other students, especially students that are Latino, Chicano that are first generation,” Mares said. “That’s a goal as a peer advisor to help other students like me that don’t really know what their career goals are at the moment.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chican@ studies department peer advisor Beatriz Cano said her main goal was to reach out to first-generation students upon becoming a peer advisor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[My goal is] to reach out to Chicanos, to let them know that they weren’t alone, they didn’t have to struggle,” Cano said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cano said she wanted to host the workshop because she was struggling to find resources to aid her graduate school application process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am pretty sure that people are interested in grad school and are struggling as bad as we are and so the purpose of this workshop is for us to help them and to help ourselves, to create this community,” Cano said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

According to the new policy, any University employee who is not a “confidential resource” — including resident assistants, teaching assistants and any other student employees</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who hears about possible sexual assault must notify the Title IX office.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a draft of the policy sent to UC campuses, University of California Office of the President (UCOP) has asked faculty, staff and students from all UC campuses to review the 25-page policy and submit comments by the end of October, after which UC’s Policy Work Group will review the suggestions and complete a final draft by January 2016. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UConsent Coordinator, Take Back the Night Co-Chair and fourth-year global and feminist studies double-major Ashley Morgan helped organize the forum and said it was important to hold an event during which a variety of people could have their voices heard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We wanted different perspectives from all different groups and backgrounds,” Morgan said. “Because we are educated on [the policy], we might not be able to come up with questions or not be able to get out of a certain tunnel vision, so it’s great to have all these different perspectives telling us what their concerns are.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assistant Director of C.A.R.E. Briana Conway said organizations need to hear specific student needs in order to best serve them</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The best of intentions — through policy and administration — if [they are] not speaking to the population who we’re trying to serve, then we’re failing,” Conway said. “I love opportunities like this where we can bridge administration’s best efforts with what really speaks to our student population.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Graduate Student Association Vice President of Committees and Planning Timothy Irvine</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who helped organize the event, the new policy would mean that survivors who do not wish to report an incident would have fewer options for confidants, seeing as many people are now required to report such information to Title IX.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It reduces the amount of people who the survivor can confide in because they know if they do confide in this person, they’re putting them in a terribly awkward position,” Irvine said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate student Jennifer Selvidge said it creates a unique problem for graduate students and teaching assistants who may be friends with their undergraduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We as graduate students and we as TAs should not be mandatory reporters so that students do have an option to confide in their friends and people they may view as their friends, like their TAs,” Selvidge said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Title IX coordinator Ricardo Alcaíno said the policy would not automatically lead the Title IX office to pursue the case if, for example, more damage would be caused to the survivor by launching an investigation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not like if someone is a responsible employee and they report it, we’re off to the races,” Alcaíno said. “It’s so no students on campus feel like there’s nothing to do. That’s the most important thing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Morgan, one of the “largest weaknesses” of the proposal is the absence of a mandatory minimum suspension for perpetrators. During a 13-hour sit-in in May, #NowUCSB campaigned for a four-quarter minimum suspension of students convicted of sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Irvine said the document should include mandatory minimum suspensions to warn students that there will be serious actions taken against perpetrators of sexual violence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of this is that people would know there will be consequences, because, so often, there are no consequences,” Irvine said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alcaíno</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> said that a mandatory suspension may impact whether or not survivors choose to report an incident.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most survivors want to know what’s going to happen to the respondent,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alcaíno</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> said. “That may determine if they’re going to come forward or how much they’re going to tell us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conway said the efforts of students, including the #NowUCSB sit-in, are resulting in more progressive policies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am so proud and honored to be a part of UCSB,” Conway said. “Students are at the center of all of this. I think student activism is what’s driving change at a large university.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The forum’s organizers plan to set up a public Google Doc where anyone can suggest changes to the policy draft. These suggestions will then be submitted to UC’s Policy Work Group, which is currently drafting the final policy for the president’s approval in January.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Google Doc is viewable <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UAWatvwkdamAuSIr85HLvsj52rd-n1AYufUnba281fM/edit\">here.</a></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nicholas-bogel-burroughs/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>test description</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:sdjklfh@kjasdn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65578\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/new-draft-for-sexual-violence-policies-to-accept-community-input/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65578\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/new-draft-for-sexual-violence-policies-to-accept-community-input/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/new-draft-for-sexual-violence-policies-to-accept-community-input/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/new-draft-for-sexual-violence-policies-to-accept-community-input/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/new-draft-for-sexual-violence-policies-to-accept-community-input/","id":2661,"author":{"id":113,"name":"Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"},"related":[2660,2659,2658],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
