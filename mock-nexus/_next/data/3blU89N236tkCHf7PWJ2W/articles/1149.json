However, as the old sports adage goes, it’s defense that wins championships and one Warriors player especially stands out in this field.</p>\n<p>Draymond Green’s legacy doesn’t only end at three-time NBA Champion, three-time NBA All-Defensive First Team and the 2017 NBA Defensive Player of the Year — but it does give you a good idea of his elite repertoire.</p>\n<p>Green is known around the league for his fiery passion and explosive play on the court, especially as of late when considering his recent string of performances in this year’s playoffs. Notably so, he’ll be entering the Finals series in fine form as he’s coming off a spectacular Western Conference Championship performance against the Portland Trailblazers, where he tallied 16.5 points per game, almost nine assists and 12 rebounds.</p>\n<p>This ability to show that he can produce on both ends of the court makes Green a significant X-Factor that the Toronto Raptors must take into account. Not to mention, he may have a good shot at Finals MVP — that is, if the next X-Factor doesn’t suit up in time for this series.    <strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Durant</strong></p>\n<p>As the current all-around best player in the league, Kevin Durant is someone who needs very little introduction. Still, his status for the NBA Finals may be in question as he’s been dealing with an apparent hamstring injury that’s kept him sidelined since the second-round series against the Houston Rockets; Golden State has already confirmed he will not be ready in time for game one in Toronto.</p>\n<p>At first, the media expected Durant’s injury to be much worse than it turned out to be, with diagnoses like an ACL tear being projected. However, recent reports have brought concern down to merely a hamstring injury which offers him a chance to return to action for the Warriors very soon.</p>\n<p>But this only begs the question of if his return may in fact hinder Golden State’s chances considering the team is 31-1 in their last 32 games with Curry and without Durant. Still, Durant’s presence should without a doubt bolster his side’s attack and offer another set of clutch hands if a win is on the line in the late-game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Regardless, these X-Factors’ potential storylines will make this 2019 NBA Finals one of the most highly anticipated championships in recent memory and will surely give basketball fans everywhere a spectacular show.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Toronto Raptors just made the NBA Finals for the first time in their franchise’s history. This is fantastic for Raptor fans; however, they are going to have to beat the Golden State Warriors, the team competing in their fifth straight finals. Does Toronto have any chance of dethroning this star-studded superteam? Obviously guys like Kawhi Leonard and Steph Curry will have crucial roles in the outcome of this series, but for the Raptors, who else is going to step up to stop the Warriors? This best of seven will most likely come down to a few key players taking their game to that next level, on the NBA’s biggest stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first potential X-Factor of this series is Kyle Lowry. The 12th year veteran out of Villanova took a lot of scrutiny early in these playoffs for his Game 1 performance versus the Orlando Magic. Since that game, he has been playing extremely efficient, averaging 14.7 points per game and with a 45% shooting percentage. Along with his scoring, Lowry has been facilitating the Raptors’ offense, averaging 6.4 assists per contest. Coming into this Finals, Lowry will face his toughest challenge yet, defending Steph Curry. Although the Warriors can score in a variety of ways, their offense is at its best when Curry is playing well. If Lowry can pester and harass Curry to force him out of the groove, then the Raptors could have a legitimate chance.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toronto’s next potential game changer in this series, is Fred VanVleet. Since the birth of his second child on May 20, VanVleet has been shooting the lights out. In the 15 playoff games prior to his sons arrival, VanVleet was not turning heads, only averaging four points per game and hitting just 19.5% of three-point attempts. Since May 20, VanVleet has broken out, now averaging 16 points per game and has nailed 82.4% of three-point attempts. If Fred VanVleet can continue this hot shooting streak, the Raptors’ chances improve dramatically in this series. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another key component to Toronto’s success is found within Pascal Siakam. Having to most likely matchup with Warriors forward, Kevin Durant, Siakam is going to have to be extremely active on the defensive end of the floor. Luckily for him, Siakam is 6’9’’, with a 7’3’’ wingspan and moves like a guard. Hopefully he can put all of his length and quickness to work when trying to contain Kevin Durant. In these playoffs, Siakam has been scoring very profficently, averaging 18.7 points per game on 45% shooting. The Raptors will need Siakam to continue to produce for them on both ends of the floor if they want any shot at winning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some athletes often think that seasons are won or lost based off of certain players within the team. This isn’t the case in the NBA Finals. Championship series are never won by one single player. Every year, the NBA Finals is won by the best team. With that, if the Toronto Raptors want any chance of hoisting the Larry O’Brien Trophy, it is going to take an overall collective effort. The starters all the way to the last guy on the bench are going to have to step up to put a stop to the Warriors’ reign. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

UCSB’s students have helped make their soccer team No. 1 in the nation in college soccer attendance for the past six years running.</p>\n<p>This year with the departure of five starters and a large number of new recruits, UCSB will have a new look to it. Sophomore Ismaila Jome leads the Gauchos from the midfield as their most exciting young prospect, being the only player on the team voted to the Big West Men’s Preseason All-Conference Team as well as being named to the Preseason All-American Third Team by College Soccer News.</p>\n<p>Defensively, stellar goalkeeper Josh McNeely will be UCSB’s last line of defense just outside the net. The sophomore is coming off of a brilliant freshman year in which he set numerous freshman program records, including lowest goals against average with 0.83 goals allowed per game and minutes played with 1,836. His performances earned him the title of Big West Preseason Defensive Player of the Year as voted by College Sports Madness.</p>\n<p>In UCSB’s first game of the preseason against Westmont, the Gauchos dominated on their way to a 2-0 victory. Senior forward Reed McKenna looks primed to be an offensive leader this season already having tied his offensive production from last year with a goal and an assist in this year’s opener.</p>\n<p>Goals might be hard to come by for a relatively inexperienced squad, especially after the departure of the team’s top two goalscorers in Goffin Boyoko and Achille Campion. However, the 15-goal total that those departing players left behind might open the door for new players to showcase their talent.</p>\n<p>“We’re replacing [last year’s starters] with one of the best freshmen classes we’ve had in a long time,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “The key is for us to incorporate our young players and have the starting sophomores step up and show their improvement. If we can get goals from new players, work on our defense and get on the same page, then by the end of the year we will be a very good team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will be playing at home during move-in weekend against San Diego State on Sept. 26 and Drake University on Sept. 28. The Gauchos’ quest for another Big West Conference title begins Oct. 2 at Harder Stadium against Cal State Northridge.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Wade’s impact was immediate and in just his third year as a professional, he would lead the Miami Heat to their first finals appearance against Dirk’s Mavericks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mavs were the favorites and won the first two games convincingly to take a 2-0 series lead. However, Wade would rise to the occasion and lead the Heat to the promised land. Miami would win the next four games and were crowned champions, and Wade was awarded the finals MVP award for his performance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both players proved that they earned their stardom by reaching the finals but would struggle to recreate their success for the next five years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be that as it may, Wade had written himself into NBA history, while Nowitzki’s career was plagued by “what-ifs” and almosts. Many — including myself — thought it was likely that he’d ended his career without ever winning a championship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2011, however, Dirk proved naysayers wrong by completing what is undoubtedly one of the most legendary championship runs in NBA history. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the finals, Dirk’s Mavs and Wade’s Heat — revamped by adding superstars LeBron James and Chris Bosh during the offseason — would meet again, and this time the Heat were the clear favorites. Yet Dirk would cement his name in history by playing like a man possessed, defeating the juggernauts in six games and rightfully earning his finals MVP.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both players are considered to be some of the best to ever play the game of basketball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wade is considered to be one of the top four shooting guards of all time. He’s personally my favorite player, and I’ve been watching him play since the day he entered the league. His 16 years have brought me great joy, and his actions on and off the court not only inspired me and many others, but also made me proud to call him a role model.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, Dirk has been a player I’ve loved and hated. His dominance in the Western conference brought me pain as I watched him defeat and deny the playoff chances of my hometown team, the Warriors, repeatedly. Yet I always respected his attitude and his loyalty. His move, the one-legged fadeaway, is iconic, feared and loved by many.

She struck out three and shut down a Gaucho lineup which dominated in their last series against Cal Poly. Gaucho catcher Samantha Stark was the lone bright spot for Santa Barbara as she had 3 hits on the day.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos did see some hope when they rallied to load the bases with two outs in the fourth inning. With freshman infielder Sierra Altmeyer, junior infielder Emily Brucelas, and freshman infielder Melanie Menor all on base, Ashley Wright stepped up to the  plate hoping to deliver a key hit.</p>\n<p>However, Misfeldt forced Wright into a groundout to end the rally. The Gauchos also rallied in the fifth by putting two runners on with one out, but Misfeldt again left them stranded.</p>\n<p>UCSB starting pitcher Ashley Ludlow pitched six innings, and took the loss. She allowed three earned runs and 12 hits in the game. Ludlow got in trouble in the first inning, after back-to-back RBI hits led to an early two-run lead for the Highlanders. UCR continued its attack, scoring again in the fourth and sixth innings.<br>\nIn the second game on Saturday afternoon, the Gauchos hitting came alive as they dominated the first three innings of the game and took an early a 6-0 lead. However, the Gauchos would soon see it all fall apart as the Highlanders rallied for five runs in the final two innings to beat the Gauchos 7-6 in a heartbreaking defeat.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos banged out eight hits in the game, registering two RBI’s each from Kristen Clark and Samantha Stark. Melanie Menor and outfielder Jessica Tetzlaft also had RBI’s.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders had 14 hits on the day led by second baseman Haley Harris who went  2-3 on the day with three RBI’s and a run scored. UCR right fielder Madeline Richard also went 3-4 with a run scored and a stolen base.</p>\n<p>Gaucho freshman starter Veronika Gulvin endured her ninth loss of the year, giving up seven runs and 14 hits in six innings of work.</p>\n<p>Riverside starter Anessa Cepeda pitched 6.2 innings, giving up six runs on eight hits while striking out two batters and walking five. Starter Tayler Misfeldt came on in relief to get the final out of the game to pick up her 16th win of the season.</p>\n<p>In Sunday’s game, the Gauchos again suffered a defeat at the hands of the Highlanders who completed the sweep with an eight inning 4-3 victory over UCSB.</p>\n<p>The game got off to a rocky start for the Gauchos as starting pitcher Veronika Gulvin gave up two earned runs in the first inning on a two-run homer by Highlander first baseman Natalie Sanchez.</p>\n<p>Ashley Ludlow then came on with only one out in the first to take over for the remainder of the game. Ludlow pitched brilliantly and took a 3-2 lead into the seventh until the Gauchos’ defense committed an error allowing the tying run to score.</p>\n<p>The game went into extra innings, but would end in Santa Barbara’s demise in the bottom of the eighth as UCSB’s defense completely collapsed. The Gauchos committed three more errors and allowed the winning run to score, handing the Highlanders the game and the series sweep.<br>\nHighlander starter Tayler Misfeldt pitched all eight innings for UCR, giving up three earned runs, one in each of the fourth, fifth and seventh innings. She gave up eight hits and struck out four in winning her 17th game of the year. Misfeldt claimed all three wins for the Highlanders in the series.</p>\n<p>UCSB will remain on the road for its next series as it will face Cal State Northridge beginning on Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69746\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-swept-by-ucr-unable-to-preserve-leads/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69746\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-swept-by-ucr-unable-to-preserve-leads/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-swept-by-ucr-unable-to-preserve-leads/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-swept-by-ucr-unable-to-preserve-leads/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-swept-by-ucr-unable-to-preserve-leads/","id":1148,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1147,1146,1145],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
