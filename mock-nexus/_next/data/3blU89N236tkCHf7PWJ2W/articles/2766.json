Novak developed the idea for the installation, titled <em>Hesperus is Phosphorus</em> (The Evening Star Carries Light).</p>\n<p>The event is the first of two memorial projects to light the tunnel from campus to I.V., the other being an interactive light installation inside Pardall Tunnel. A third lighting project, Blunite, created by students in art professor Kim Yasuda’s class, I.V. Open Lab, will illuminate I.V. and the campus with blue lights using Professor Shuji Nakamura’s Nobel Prize-wining LED technology.</p>\n<p>Novak said he wants the Field of Light project to resemble a field of poppies during the day and stars in the sky at night.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to do something with a field of poppies that looked like stars,” Novak said. ‘The only way we can do this is with solar lights — they’re sustainable, we don’t need wiring and they’ll come on at night. They’ll be like a star field and you can look up at the sky.”</p>\n<p>According to Novak, community participation is a key part of social change.</p>\n<p>“It really takes an effort on everyone’s part to keep the world civilized,” Novak said. “It’s about what we build together. It’s the effort we put in together. And to highlight the things the world wants to encourage and diminish the things we don’t want to encourage.”</p>\n<p>Novak said he hopes art installments like the Field of Light will increase safety on campus.</p>\n<p>“This project is hopefully a beginning so we can do more such interventions on campus,” Novak said. “Not only annually as a reference but throughout. It’s already very beautiful but we can make it more beautiful.”</p>\n<p>Novak said though Pardall Tunnel is frequently used, it is poorly lit and will better connect I.V. and campus once the lighting projects are complete.</p>\n<p>“The main thing is to let people know that they’re welcome to campus, to let people know they’re safe when they exit campus,” Novak said. “To form a bridge between Isla Vista and campus and to make the presence of people in the tunnel important and illuminated.”</p>\n<p>Bhavnani said her goal is to unite the community through the solar light display and to celebrate the lives of those who passed away on May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“We are honoring those who were lost,” Bhavnani said. “We want to plant the solar lights as a way to bring the community together in act of common remembrance.”</p>\n<p>According to Bhavnani, the event is a way to remember those who passed away last spring, and the use of LED lights helps to honor Nakamura’s achievement, as well.</p>\n<p>“I want do something for the campus and I think this is a wonderful way to remember those who are deceased and to bring light into our lives,” Bhavnani said. “Especially with Shuji Nakamura being awarded a Nobel prize, that’s also a type of honor. Somehow it all comes together.”</p>\n<p>Event organizer and second-year mathematics major Anjali Naicker said she encourages people to volunteer as part of a community healing process.</p>\n<p>“I really hope everyone comes and becomes a part of this artwork,” Naicker said. “The art is beautiful and it will be really magical in a way.”</p>\n<p>Naicker said the event is especially significant because the domestic dispute Monday evening on Sabado Tarde Road triggered emotions in many students.</p>\n<p>“We really need this, especially right now,” Naicker said. “It brought back a lot of anger and painful memories. How dare the media bring these feelings back? We need to heal now more than ever and I feel grateful to be a part of such a beautiful event.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63350\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/art-installation-to-light-campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63350\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/art-installation-to-light-campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/art-installation-to-light-campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/art-installation-to-light-campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/art-installation-to-light-campus/","id":2766,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2765,2764,2763],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli","biography":"Not available","articles":[2332,2347,2356,2359,2380,2387,2428,2433,2440,2446,2452,2460,2463,2464,2468,2470,2474,2484,2497,2510,2521,2528,2555,2569,2573,2626,2627,2628,2642,2706,2745,2751,2753,2756,2766,2770,2806,2836,2975,2979,2987,2993,3451,3593,3596,3759,3762,3765,3899,3901,3909,3963,3965,3969,3986,4462,4464,4483,4505,4521,4623,4647,4699,4768],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Nuglets of Wisdom: Tar, Seaweed and Finding a Surf Niche","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I used to get a lot of dirty comments about the big bottle of Johnson’s Baby Oil Gel I keep in the shower rack.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I used to get a lot of dirty comments about the big bottle of Johnson’s Baby Oil Gel I keep in the shower rack.

Like an STD for a beach, I.V. is plagued with massive deposits of kelp.</p>\n<p>The stuff is possessed, I swear it. Like clockwork, every time you’re having a particularly crowded sesh and the wave you’ve been waiting for comes along, you’ll start paddling or try to jump to your feet — only to be thrown backward like a hog-tied animal, constricted by the kelp’s tentacles. More than a few times I could’ve seriously benefitted from carrying a weedwacker in the surf.</p>\n<p>To be fair, most every surf location has its own quirks. Regardless of your talent, you’ll quickly learn things about the local toothed marine animals, rock formations, shallow reefs, troublesome kelp, rough beach accesses, rip tides, river mouths and the multitude of little obstacles particular to different surf locations. However, some beaches are pristine — unmarred by dangerous protuberances or crafty tides. But those are the rare ones.</p>\n<p>For instance, I know that at a certain secretive surf spot underneath the Golden Gate in SF, anyone paddling out during a quickly outgoing tide is sure to be sucked out to sea, to float in absolute fear in the cold, shadowy waters underneath the massive orange bridge.</p>\n<p>I also know that if you visited the Westside in Santa Cruz on a solid swell, the Lane has a dangerous rock bordering the takeoff zone that’ll take a hefty chunk out of your boards, fins or dome if you don’t hop it as you pump the line.</p>\n<p>Sands Beach has a particularly menacing rock — about a quarter of the way to the river mouth, in the inside — that exposes itself on left-breaking waves at low tide and lurks just beneath the surface on a higher tide.</p>\n<p>As surfers, we accumulate a repertoire of water lore that is both essential to our survival and complimentary to our understanding of the elements and the melding of soul with nature. Most of the time, it’s going to take a couple of scrapes and bruises to alert you of certain ocean phenomena in your surf realm.</p>\n<p>Notice I said “your surf realm.” That’s the whole point. By encountering the risks and perks that come with the sport, you craft for yourself a niche in the spiritual, soulful sea, a niche that few understand but most envy.</p>\n<p>So go find your niche. There’s nothing worse than going to the first full week of class without first dousing yourself in tangy brine-water and rubbing tar out of your hair with baby oil, all in quest of that elusive perfect session.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus <em>surf columnist Elliott Rosenfeld hopes your surf niche doesn’t get in the way of his.

organization, the remaining funds will be used to pay for special projects and community events throughout the year that are sponsored by KCSB Radio. <em>Tamari Dzotsenidze/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The student-run radio station struggled to match previous fund drives which raised $35,000 in 2017 and $29,000 the year before.</p>\n<p>Miles Bishop, KCSB general manager, explained that last year’s Thomas Fire impacted the station’s ability to advertise for the event and win over donors.</p>\n<p>“[The fires] really put us out of commission for the whole of December,” he explained.</p>\n<p>In previous years, the fund drive’s planning started in November and had about three-and-a-half months for setting up and advertising. This year, that time was cut down by a month.</p>\n<p>Besides preparation issues, Bishop said that conflicting fundraising relief aid for the Thomas Fire and Montecito mudslides was another factor in the drop in donations.</p>\n<p>Although he hadn’t cross-checked KCSB’s donor list, he guessed that the previous contributors were providing more towards relief efforts.</p>\n<p>“Some people weren’t really comfortable donating to us when there’s other causes for direct relief,” he said.</p>\n<p>The radio station’s event faced another roadblock with the adoption of a last-minute advertising pitch to contribute 10 percent of every $1,000 dollars collected by KCSB to the Direct Relief organization assisting in aid for areas affected by the fires and Montecito mudslides.</p>\n<p>This pledge required KCSB to tiptoe over university warnings and get an official invoice from Direct Relief in order to fulfill that promise.</p>\n<p>According to Bishop, “The university didn’t want us to act as agents of [Direct Relief]. We can’t say we’re ‘donating’ 10 percent. We have to say we’re contributing to them, but not on their behalf.”</p>\n<p>Despite conflict and delays, the radio station continued the fund drive that consisted of 24-hour radio shows that asked listeners to donate. They also offered listeners “thank you gifts” like vinyl records, concert tickets and others.</p>\n<p>KCSB also sponsored festival events in downtown Santa Barbara and hosted an open-mic night fundraiser in Goleta.</p>\n<p>After contributing 10 percent of every $1,000 raised to the Direct Relief organization, the remaining funds will be used to pay for special projects and community events throughout the year that are sponsored by KCSB Radio.</p>\n<p>Despite the challenges, Bishop is satisfied with everything he and his team put together.</p>\n<p>“In the grand scheme of things, 23k is pretty good and I’m really proud of everyone I’m working with, especially given the circumstances,” he said.</p>\n<p>While the official fundraiser has ended, online donations will still be collected until March 16, through PayPal and Network for Good.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the March 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of the story stated KCSB would donate “10 percent to the Direct Relief organization.” The station will donate 10 percent of every $1,000 raised. The story also stated Bishop referred to KCSB’s 2017 donor list and “contested” that the donors were now putting money toward relief efforts. Bishop said he hadn’t cross-checked the donors between this year and last and he only “guessed” that the donors were contributing money elsewhere.</em></p><div

Food Bank, which caused students to mistake it for a sign-in sheet.

The other week we reported that 2,100 used the food bank on the three days it was open,” he said.</p>\n<p>During the week of Feb. 26, Le set up his petition in the Food Bank and students mistakenly signed it, thinking it was a sign-in sheet, according to the Food Bank Committee’s minutes from a March 2 meeting.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_81874\" style=\"width: 753px\" class=\"wp-caption

id=\"caption-attachment-81874\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">“We’ve actually crossed off all the names of the students who mistakenly signed onto that petition, mistaking it for the food bank sign-in sheet … We were able to move that sign-in sheet,” Le said. <em>Photo submitted anonymously</em></p></div>\n<p>“The petition misled since it was stating that it was mainly meant for the expansion of the Food Bank without clearly stating of the expansion of the UCen by increasing student fees,” advisor Rodolfo Ortiz said at the Food Bank Committee’s meeting.</p>\n<p>“The petition was put next to the sign-in sheet which caused students to mistake between the forms,” Vice Chair Tabitha Yuen said at the meeting.</p>\n<p>The minutes reference the petition as having been “set-up by Hieu Le at the Food Bank lounge last week.”</p>\n<p>Le, however, did not respond when asked if he had set up the petition in the food bank himself.</p>\n<p>Le acknowledged that the petition had been placed “next to the sign-in sheet for the actual food bank.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve actually crossed off all the names of the students who mistakenly signed onto that petition, mistaking it for the food bank sign-in sheet … We were able to move that sign-in sheet,” he said.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to “disapprove” the UCen expansion petition in the food bank during the March 2 meeting, meaning they will no longer allow the petition to be placed within the bank, according to first-year history major James Ferraro.</p>\n<p>“The ballot language is long and extensive … What I would argue is that people aren’t going to look through it in depth, people are going to vote for things and not see it, and so people are going to pass a fee raise,” Ferraro said.</p>\n<p>Funding for the project will come from a combination of student fees, the university itself and an alumni donation fund, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“We’ve raised about $2.5 million on campus equities, not donors yet,” Le said. “There is an anticipation that we’re gonna raise quite a good amount, but we don’t have a certain figure in mind yet.”</p>\n<p>Senator Alexandra Gessesse and Dumlao both said Le and his fellow students have not been open regarding fees when approaching students about the petition.</p>\n<p>“Not only have I witnessed [this], but constituents have told me that they’re not being told the fact that their student fees are going to be increased,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>“The issue is, even if we get donors and we assume that they’re going to give us $10 million, there’s still a budget that needs to be covered that would be from the student expense,” she added.</p>\n<p>Dumlao explained the project is being publicized as expanding the food bank and improving the UCen rather than focusing on the fact that student fees will rise.</p>\n<p>“I’ve heard from multiple people, both people who have been asked to sign the petition and … people who Hieu has been soliciting to work with him, that they have been told not to say or explicitly mention right off the bat that student fees will be raised if you sign that,” he said.</p>\n<p>Le denied not fully explaining the petition to students.</p>\n<p>“The cost is reflected in the petition, and our process is to hold the highest standards of integrity,” Le said. “Students at this university are very smart, and they know what they’re signing and they know what the idea is. Our job is to educate them on the process.”</p>\n<p>According to the petition, the UCen is now more than 50 years old, was designed to accommodate 17,000 students and was last updated in 1994. Currently, UCSB has more than 25,000 students and 6,800 faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>It is projected that 28,000 students will be enrolled by 2025, the petition says.</p>\n<p>“These facilities can no longer support the needs of our growing community, nor are they designed to keep up with the ever-changing and increasing technological demands of the current generation,” the petition reads.</p>\n<p>The project was first proposed six years ago, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“All three sponsors, A.S., the Division of Student Affairs and the University Center worked and consulted with students, clubs and organizations,” Le said. “The Office of Budget &amp; Planning was the one who drafted the [current] proposal.”</p>\n<p>If the petition is placed on the ballot and students vote in favor of it, student fees will increase $21.42 per quarter during Fall Quarter 2018. The increase will remain an additional $21.42 per quarter until Fall Quarter 2022, at which point it will increase to a “maximum” of $99.61 per quarter, including summer, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“We’re addressing an overcrowded campus; students are competing against each other for spots, spots inside the classroom; people are sitting in the aisles; students are waiting two weeks to see a psychological or academic counselor,” Le said.</p>\n<p>“Essentially, what we’re looking at is that students are competing against each other for spots, rather than we’re not addressing the issue in terms of providing access, and fair access, to each and every single one of our campus community [members],” he added.</p>\n<p>The petition needs 3,116 signatures to be placed on the ballot for students to vote on during Spring Quarter, according to Le. The deadline to get these signatures is March 16 and as of Wednesday night, the petition has approximately 2,000 signatures.</p>\n<p><em>Shomik Mukherjee contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Gessesse said “constituents,” not “kids.”</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the March 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
