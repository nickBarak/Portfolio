Signa filed his own lawsuit against former UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson in November 2018. <em>Nexus file photo </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit makes several allegations against current and former members of UCPD, including former Chief of Police Dustin Olson, former Assistant Chief of Police Cathy Farley, Lieutenant David Millard, Lieutenant Mark Signa, Lieutenant Robert Romero, Officer Tiffany Little, Officer Michael Little and Officer Ryan Hashimoto.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges Smith was consistently retaliated against by UCPD staff for bringing attention to concerning practices and behaviors within the department. Some of Smith’s concerns included alleged police mockery of Chancellor Henry T. Yang, of fellow officers and of sexual assault and rape victims, as well as falsifying sexual assault reports and racial discrimination. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit is the most recent of the three to be filed. It alleges that Lieutenant Signa, the plaintiff in the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mark Signa v. UC Regents </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">case against UCPD filed in November 2018, consistently retaliated against Smith. Smith allegedly brought repeated grievances about Lieutenant Signa and other officers’ behavior to former Chief Olson, but court documents state Smith “has continued to be the target of harassment and retaliation” – even after resigning from the department in November 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mark Signa v. UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, court documents allege that Smith participated in a “Good Ole Boys’ Club” within the department, which allegedly fostered and condoned misconduct, favoritism, harassment and retaliation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final of the three suits filed against UCPD since November is from Officers Tiffany and Michael Little, spouses working within the department. According to court documents, in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Little v. UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the pair alleged that they were retaliated against after reporting Smith for allegedly having an extramarital affair with a subordinate officer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All three cases referenced specific events in which the officers were both involved but alleged different circumstances and details on what exactly happened. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the most recent case filed, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe v. UCPD</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Smith alleges that Officer Signa, Officers Tiffany and Michael Little and Officer Hashimoto “engaged in relentless acts of defamation of character and false light” and “have created and promoted a narrative within the UCPD and surrounding law enforcement agencies” about Smith’s resignation and integrity as an officer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case also alleges that Lieutenant Signa, the Littles and other officers “conspired” against Smith by making a personnel complaint against him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith resigned near the end of 2017 due to alleged “ongoing harassment and retaliation” and UCSB’s “inaction” in response to the conduct, court documents state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allegations in Smith’s case against UCPD date back to 2014, shortly after Smith was hired in the department, according to court documents. Below are the specific allegations the case makes against individual UCPD officers and the department as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><b>Lieutenant Mark Signa </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Court documents allege that since the start of Smith’s employment in August 2012, a group of officers have “consistently failed to leave the station for nearly entire shifts and spent most nights at the station playing video games, watching movies, and/or browsing the internet.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lieutenant Signa allegedly participated in these activities and showed “inappropriate ‘Youtube’ videos to the squad.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As sergeant, Smith allegedly “gave clear directives that officers were to stay out of the station, not to watch TV or movies or play video games on duty,” court documents state. In response, Lieutenant Signa allegedly “scoffed” at Smith’s directives and posted “multiple colored photocopies of [World War II-era] General Patton throughout [the] station” with Smith’s name on them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith also allegedly requested multiple trainings in the time span between 2015 and 2017, but “Signa denied all of these requests, while consistently allowing other sergeants to attend courses,” court documents allege. When Smith asked about this, Lieutenant Signa allegedly said Smith was “developed enough” and that the “Department did not need to spend any money” on Smith. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around April 2015, amid “scrutiny regarding the handling of sexual assault cases,” the department allegedly took reports in which “males were being listed as rape and sexual assault suspects, despite no evidence of a crime occurring,” according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The department also allegedly took reports “where victim’s statements were being exaggerated to meet elements of a crime.” Signa allegedly ordered that officers continue “classifying all males as suspects in any sex-related case, whether or not a crime had occurred.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly expressed concern that this practice was “libelous” and did not adhere to “standard and appropriate law enforcement procedures, and potentially violated due process.” Signa allegedly “became upset” with Smith and told him to “let the district attorney figure out who is guilty and who is not.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa also allegedly said “UCPD could not afford the political scrutiny.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD members also allegedly created a “secret log” for sexual or domestic violence cases, which all officers in the department had access to. Officers were allegedly “not to disclose knowledge of this log within their reports to avoid discovery.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly reported concerns of the secret log to Olson and Farley. Olson allegedly said he would “look into” the concerns. Court documents say this secret log still exists within the UCPD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the end of 2016, Signa allegedly ordered Smith to continue training “an African American officer, despite the fact that the Officer was not meeting the training standards.” Signa allegedly said “it was a politically sensitive matter because the officer was black,” citing Olson’s desire for greater diversity in the department. Smith allegedly reported Signa’s statements to UCPD staff, but no action was taken. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In February 2017, Smith was allegedly assigned to a “mutual aid response” at UC Berkeley for the upcoming campus appearance from Milo Yiannopoulos. While at the event, UC Berkeley police officers allegedly “refused to allow the officers assisting from various U.C. Police Departments” to intervene with “students and civilians [who] were being brutally beaten by the anarchists.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly reported the events at UC Berkeley and his concerns to Olson and was questioned by Olson upon his return from UC Berkeley. Olson allegedly “received a call from U.C. Berkeley Police Chief Margo Bennett,” who yelled at Olson and was “furious” with Smith for voicing concerns regarding the Milo Yiannopoulos event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further incidents regarding Signa can be viewed on pages 5 through 10 of the court documents. </span></p>\n<p><b>Officer Ryan Hashimoto </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Smith served as sergeant for UCPD, he allegedly “reported several violations of policy and law to Signa,” which continued to create points of retaliation against Smith. Some of those violations pertained to Officer Hashimoto’s alleged misconduct in the office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Officer Hashimoto allegedly “made multiple cartoon videos” of officers, crime victims, citizens, university officials and employees in which he “used his own voice to play the character of each person.” At times, the videos “were discriminatory toward several protected classes of persons.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hashimoto allegedly created a video depicting an officer in the department – referred to as “Officer M” in the complaint – who was known to allegedly contact “female sexual assault victims unsolicited,” as well as sexual assault advocates from the Women’s Center. The video allegedly “depicts the advocates yelling ‘Rape!’ at the victims and forcing the victims to make sexual assault reports.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith also allegedly reported Officer M to Signa after Smith discovered that “Officer M was having sexual assault advocates call his personal phone directly to report cases” without notifying a dispatch or supervisor. Smith ordered Officer M to stop this practice. UCPD allegedly took no action regarding Officer M.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hashimoto’s alleged videos also depicted Chancellor Yang with Officer Hashimoto using a “Chinese accent, making derogatory and inappropriate statements.” Hashimoto also allegedly mocked an African-American dispatcher through “videos and in person impersonations.” Hashimoto’s alleged impersonations of the dispatcher included mockery of the dispatcher “speaking and eating food.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On another occasion, Hashimoto allegedly acted out “a fictional situation where the dispatcher was playing with a large black dildo that Hashimoto named ‘King Kong Dong.’” Officer Hashimoto allegedly “often walked into different areas of the UCPD and would yell ‘King Kong Dong’ while impersonating the dispatchers voice. He would position his forearm in front of his groin area, and then slap his arm on desktops as if he was slapping a dildo on the desktop.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Officer Hashimoto also allegedly “inappropriately joked” and stated to UCPD staff “that the victim in the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/rape-2014-daniel-chen-ucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniel Chen rape and kidnap case</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> contracted herpes from the suspect,” while UCPD was conducting the investigation. Officer Hashimoto allegedly “mocked the victim’s Asian accent, and in the accent stated: ‘I have herpes on my pussy.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In January 2018, while Smith was working in Montecito following the Thomas Fire and the Montecito mudslides, he was shown a recording allegedly made by Hashimoto in which Hashimoto was verbally “mocking an evidence video and audio recording” related to the sexual assault, sodomy, kidnapping and robbery case of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/trial-for-iv-menus-owner-will-begin-in-late-july/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">v.</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Patrick Galoustian</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this video – a tape of Galoustian allegedly “sexual[ly] assaulting a transvestite victim” – Hashimoto allegedly mocked Galoustian’s accent in a voice-over, made sexual references to the victim and made “statements in essence of rubbing their (Galoustian and the trans victim’s penis’ together).”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly reported the video to UCPD on Jan. 27, 2018. At the time, Olson and Lieutenant Millard allegedly confirmed that they were “aware of the recording.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Officer Tiffany Little and Officer Michael Little </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith also reported alleged misconduct from married UCPD officers Tiffany and Michael Little, who “frequently left their assigned patrol areas while on duty and traveled to their personal residence in Goleta using UCPD vehicles.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Littles would also allegedly “stay at their residences for extended periods of time, fail to answer calls for service, and ask other officers to handle calls for service for them.” The suit alleges that the Littles’ actions “are a violation of policy and a theft of funds.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to court documents, Officer Michael Little also allegedly “talked about his fantasy to have a black man try to steal his wallet so he can ‘fucking shoot him in the fucking face.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Officer Michael Little allegedly approached Smith and other officers and “related a fictitious story about how he (Little) is walking through a parking lot and a black man approaches him and tries to rob him of his wallet. Little would then mimic responding by stating, ‘How about I shoot you in the fucking face!’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He would then allegedly “slightly draw his firearm from the holster as if he was going to draw his weapon” while reciting the story. Little allegedly “acted out this fantasy, by telling the story” while he was instructing at the firing range and “fir[ed] his duty weapon multiple times” at the shooting target. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly reported Little’s actions to Signa, but “Signa dismissed the claims against Michael Little and Hashimoto as ‘blowing off steam.’” The suit alleges that “Signa deliberately failed to take any action to further investigate the claims against Tiffany Little because of his personal relationships with these officers.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit further alleges that “Signa conspired with Michael Little, Tiffany Little, and Hashimoto to knowingly file false accusations of misconduct against [Smith] in the form of a personnel complaint,” resulting in an Internal Affairs investigation into Smith and an administrative leave that lasted over a month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly “requested an internal investigation into the false accusations made against him.” As of late March 2019, UCPD has allegedly “failed to investigate the officers who made false allegations against” Smith, according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Smith’s resignation at the end of 2017, Signa allegedly told UCPD staff that Smith resigned “in bad standing, to avoid termination.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly demanded “for the harassment, retaliation, and first amendment violations to cease, no less than ten times since his departure from UCPD” in person to Olson, Farley and Lieutenant Millard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the university allegedly “hired an attorney to investigate” Smith’s complaints, the Littles allegedly “briefed and debriefed several individuals before and after interviews” relating to the investigation and “attempted to recruit members of UCPD” to make complaints against Lieutenant Millard and Olson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that Smith “continues to suffer losses in earnings and other employment benefits as well as past and future non-economic injury.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peter Horton, Smith’s lawyer, wrote in an email to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith attempted to address significant misconduct relating to Lt. Mark Signa, Officer Michael Little, Officer Tiffany Little, and Officer Ryan Hashimoto.

But he made it clear from his first moments wearing a Trail Blazers uniform that he was not just another early first-round point guard bust. Lillard took the NBA on in his rookie year <em>à</em><em> </em>la Chris Paul in 2005, taking home Rookie of the Year honors in a landslide. He was fearless, he was very good and just about everyone who saw him knew that he was going to be something special.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to this year, and to say that the Blazers’ future is bright would be a huge understatement. Lillard finished his first ever first-round series with averages of 25-6-6, with all of his main statistical categories making drastic improvements. With LaMarcus Aldridge complementing Lillard’s all-star play, the Blazers were able to take down the fourth-seeded Houston Rockets in six games. The last play we saw from that series will surely be remembered for years to come. With 0.9 seconds left, trailing by two, Lillard caught the ball off a screen, quickly planted his feet and knocked down one of the most cold-blooded threes I have ever seen, sending his team to the next round.</p>\n<p>He’s a guy who plays well beyond his years, and if he keeps progressing at this rate, we’re going to be seeing him hold up an MVP trophy someday, whether it’s in May or June.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Dwight Howard – Looking Bad</b></p>\n<p>Speaking of Lillard’s shot, my favorite moment was actually the one we saw shortly after. The Laker in me will hate the Blazers as a team forever, but it will always love that post-game celebration for one reason: Dwight Howard’s face.</p>\n<p>Dwight was once a top MVP candidate in Orlando and the easy choice for Defensive Player of the Year. He was once considered Superman. But ever since the Dwightmare began, it’s all gone downhill for him. He was out with a back injury for his final days in Orlando, traded to the Lakers, experienced the worst, most embarrassing year in the Kobe Bryant era at the time (and there have been a couple of really bad ones) and ran away from the bright lights to Houston. It didn’t take long for him and the rest of the league to realize that Dwight’s days playing second fiddle to a shooting guard were not over yet.</p>\n<p>This team has been clearly established as James Harden’s team from the second Harden arrived two years ago. Let’s face it though — Dwight’s numbers are still up there. He averaged 26 points and nearly 14 rebounds per game in the first round — it’s just the way he looks on the court. He used to be the closest thing to Shaq we had left. He used to be a dominant force. For the last two years, though, he’s looked like a pushover. His mentality is that of a pushover, and his record of 2-8 in the playoffs since leaving Orlando is something that is surely haunting his already-tarnished reputation right now.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Oklahoma City Thunder – Looking Bad</b></p>\n<p>Losing Game Five at home — no matter how close it was to a win — was not something that these hopeful champs should have let happen. They did what they were supposed to do, winning Game Six in Memphis in a convincing fashion and finishing it off at home in Game Seven, but there are some holes in the Thunder’s armor that the rest of the league is surely aware of.</p>\n<p>The last time Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant were both healthy in the playoffs, they made it to the Finals. However, San Antonio will have no fear playing the young Thunder superstars with home-court advantage and the powers of the anti-aging serum Gregg Popovich has been feeding his team for the last 10 years. That is, if the Spurs even make it to the conference finals, because Chris Paul is hungry for some championship action. Time to shape up, OKC; this is supposed to be your time to shine, not the Clippers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Brooklyn Nets – Looking Good</b></p>\n<p>This is a team that was built for the playoffs. Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce look fresher than they did all season. Deron Williams and Joe Johnson are perennial All-Stars and have plenty of playoff experience themselves. The Nets swept Miami 4-0 in the regular season. Yes, it’s just the regular season, but when it comes to taking down the champs in the playoffs, you need to take every advantage you can get. The Nets have the advantage of confidence and leaders who have beaten LeBron numerous times in the past. Brooklyn-Miami will be a fun series.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Indiana Pacers – Looking Bad</b></p>\n<p>Well, when you talk about OKC going down 3-2 to Memphis, at least you’re talking about a pair of 50-win teams. The Pacers should be embarrassed for going down 3-2 to the Atlanta Hawks, a team that was well below .500 and still managed to make the playoffs in a poorly contested Eastern Conference. They tend to step up their game against Miami, but after barely slipping by Atlanta, this team had better get its act together quickly. Luckily, they have the Wizards in the second round and not the Nets.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Let’s hope for more amazing games in round two!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55153\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/nba-playoffs-first-round-winners-and-losers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55153\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/nba-playoffs-first-round-winners-and-losers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/nba-playoffs-first-round-winners-and-losers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/nba-playoffs-first-round-winners-and-losers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/nba-playoffs-first-round-winners-and-losers/","id":2066,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[2065,2064,2063],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nexus Sports Editors Say Their Goodbyes: Kristen Henneman","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SportsEditorsPeterVandenbelt.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SportsEditorsPeterVandenbelt.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Kristen and Paul-Michael Dish on UCSB, Isla Vista and Their Time as Sports Editors  ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>“The thing about doing what you love is you never know if it’s going to happen and you never know if you’re going to get to do it one more day, but the fact that you’re doing it right now or trying to do it or working towards it, it’s like stepping stones.

It stuck, and I’ve never looked back.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>At UCSB, it’s only continued to grow. These four years have flown by and now, after studying for more hours than I’d like to count, writing hundreds of articles, spending dozens of late nights/new days in the Nexus office and having countless laughs, I formally say goodbye to the school (and that wonderful beach less than 10 minutes from my doorstep) I love so much.</p>\n<p>SB has truly become my home. My time in Santa Barbara and with the Nexus has only been a part of my journey, but what a journey it’s been.</p>\n<p>In my time here with the Nexus, I’ve written the season of our men’s soccer team that at one point was No. 2 in the nation. I wrote the track season in 2012 when we had athletes make it to Olympic Trials. I’ve done a one-on-one interview with three-time Olympic Gold Medalist Kerri Walsh Jennings. I’ve sat courtside in the Honda Center not once, but twice, to watch our women’s basketball team in the Big West Playoffs, including watching the team win the title in 2012. I’ve won a CCMA award for a column I wrote on Title IX. And most recently, this year, I received the opportunity to interview the Sacramento Kings, my hometown team, during training camp here at UCSB.</p>\n<p>My experience with the Nexus has truly exceeded anything I could ever imagine and I am truly honored to have brought you your sports coverage every day.</p>\n<p>So Gauchos, while I’m going to leave the philosophical stuff to my co-editor, I do have two pieces of advice for you all.</p>\n<p>It may be cliché, but find something you love and never let anyone tell you that you can’t or that you’re not good enough. I tell people all the time I would pay others to do my job. It’s one of the best feelings in the world.<br>\nThe second is to enjoy the sports here. No, we’re not a part of the Pac-12 and we don’t have an elite football team, but we have some fantastic teams here on campus. Give them a shot.</p>\n<p>Finally, I have some major thank yous to give out. First, thank you to my friends and family for your support and always reading my articles when I tell you to. Thank you to the athletic department for not only your verbal, but financial support. Thanks to every coach and athlete I’ve ever interviewed. I know I’m just a pain for you guys a lot of the time, but I really do enjoy and appreciate your time. Thank you to the 2011 softball team, my first ever team with the Nexus, for making me fall in love with sports journalism all over again.</p>\n<p>A very special shout out to the women’s basketball teams the last three years. I’ve written every game covered by the Nexus during the Carlene Mitchell era and some of those moments have been my favorite during my time here. Of course, a very big thank you to Coach Mitch. You’re the coach I’ve most gotten to know on campus and I’ve loved every second talking with you and getting to pick your brain about women’s basketball.</p>\n<p>Thanks to my staff, especially my co-editor PMO (we’ve made the best team), for putting up with my perfectionistic ways deep into the night. And most importantly, to the readers — you are the reason we’ve been the No. 9 newspaper the last two years. Keep it up.</p>\n<p>Because I hate goodbyes, I’m simply going to say see you later, UCSB.<br>\nLove,</p>\n<p>Kristen</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55653\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55653\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/","id":2067,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[2066,2065,2064],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Term in Review: A.S.

Going in, she believed “people just knew what this office does… but in reality, I found out that besides going to Senate meetings and talking to various orgs, they had no idea what this office was.”</p>\n<p>She said her “biggest success” was kickstarting a plan to get the bike shop a permanent location on campus, a task she has been working on throughout the school year. Approximately $3 million is budgeted for the project so far, she said, noting that the bike shop is something that the majority of campus utilizes.</p>\n<p>Because the project is still in its early stages – Kopel presented the shop’s plans at Wednesday night’s Senate meeting – it will ultimately be up to President-elect Alison Sir to see the project through its entirety.</p>\n<p>In regards to the tuition hike, Kopel said she was “blessed” that the UC Regents listened to the students on lobby trips in that they decided not to raise in-state tuition for the 2018-2019 school year.</p>\n<p>She noted that she herself has gone on two different lobby trips over the past year, one to DC and another to the student lobby conference in Sacramento, lobbying for Pell Grant and Cal Grant expansion.</p>\n<p>Kopel also praised the work the EVPSA office has done <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-08/evpsa-position-will-remain-vacant-until-spring-elections-board-says/\">without an actual EVPSA</a> , highlighting its efforts with Coffee and Calls and on the several lobby trips throughout the year.</p>\n<p>She referenced the latest out-of-state resident tuition hike that was on the UC Regents’s table, noting that her office, in conjunction with the EVPSA office, “mobilized to get people out [there and] make it definitely aware that [the tuition hike] was happening.”</p>\n<p>She also met with UC President Janet Napolitano once a quarter, along with all of the other UC undergraduate student presidents, and said she was proud that during every single meeting, they “addressed tuition hikes and basic needs and college affordability.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve talked about that every single time and made it aware to the [UC] president that the council of presidents won’t stand for anything less than making college more and more affordable.”</p>\n<p>In regards to the natural disaster relief fund, Kopel said she found it difficult to “navigate the administration” and what routes to take when looking for sources of money.</p>\n<p>She explained that during this past year, she rediscovered an A.S. Excellence Fund that had been created by 2013-2014 A.S. President Jonathan Abboud during his time as president. The fund, made up entirely by alumni donations, was meant to be used for “bettering the academic experience of students.”</p>\n<p>The vague description means the fund can be put toward a large variety of uses, Kopel said.</p>\n<p>Currently, the fund has approximately $2,000 in it and has not yet been used. Kopel is currently working on getting more money into the fund so it can help students facing financial crisis from natural disasters in the future.</p>\n<p>“I’m really hoping that by the end of the quarter, we’ll be able to reach that $10,000 mark at the fund, and that at that point it will become an endowment and can start generating its funds,” she said. “Even if I don’t reach that $10,000 goal [by the end of the quarter]… Alison will be able to pick it up really easily next year.”</p>\n<p>In regards to helping sexual assault suvivors, Kopel referenced her work with Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), stating that she did “a lot of work with them” in Fall Quarter 2018 by helping with the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/sasa-releases-list-of-asks-plans-to-approach-ucsb-administration/\">Asks</a> they put together.</p>\n<p>Aside from tangible projects, Kopel said she believed her role throughout the past year on this campus was to be visible, to help connect marginalized communities and those advocating on campus “with the people that they really need to get their efforts seen [by].”</p>\n<p>“When it comes to supporting communities and specifically the survivor community, there’s already so much work that’s going on that I don’t want to co-op or take credit for or change [what they’re doing] because they’re so strong.”</p>\n<p>Kopel said that as the first woman president in four years – with James Villarreal in 2015-2016, Austin Hechler in 2016-2017 and Hieu Le in 2017-2018 – she felt it was a “responsibility of mine” to do whatever she could to “be supportive and [be] there for survivors and for women.”</p>\n<p>She noted that she was proud of helping set up the Hate and Bias On Campus town hall.</p>\n<p>She further denounced Betsy DeVos’s proposed Title IX changes, stating there has to be “ample protections in place for survivors on UC campuses.”</p>\n<p>One of Kopel’s other platform points, one she referenced during her candidate forum, was “uniting the campus.” In that, Kopel said “uniting the campus,” for her, means “standing up for people who are unseen by this campus or underrepresented, or never heard enough.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve written letters for, spoke up for, gone to meeting with, spoken on a system wide level to the [UC] president [for underrepresented communities],” she said.</p>\n<p>“[I’ve gone] out to strikes, whether it be for AFSCMEor the Pan Asian Network, using my platform to uplift those voices that aren’t heard enough is a way to show as many people on campus as possible that these communities are in need, that these communities need support more than they’re getting.”</p>\n<p><strong>Nonpartisanship: </strong></p>\n<p>She praised the 69th Senate’s success in terms of the bills and resolutions passed; according to Kopel, this year’s Senate put out a “record number” of resolutions and bills, particularly in putting out resolutions that support “various communities” on campus.</p>\n<p>“I think Senate has definitely made it one of their priorities to make sure that they’re standing up for these students… I think there’s a few shining stars in Senate that have made work their priorities, but there’s a lot of others that kind of have been hidden under the brush.”</p>\n<p>But she noted the contentious situation that this year’s Senate brought: “Not only does it feel kind of tense and the air is really thick in there, but you can visually see a divide. You can tell who’s been elected by Campus United and you can tell who’s been elected from the Isla Vista Party.”</p>\n<p>Kopel attributed that fault and toxicity to both parties.</p>\n<p>“Partisanship and toxicity and harmful words and attacks get in the way of work we’re supposed to be doing.”</p>\n<p>Kopel was also tasked during her presidency with <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-30/vacant-judicial-council-seats-filled-nine-weeks-after-quarter-begins/\">filling four vacant Judicial Council seats</a> – an unprecedented situation in recent UCSB student government history, and one that caused “uproar” within the Senate as Kopel presented her chosen appointments.</p>\n<p>“I was heavily affiliated with Campus United [at the time] and the Senate was split [on Judicial Council appointments], 50-50,” Kopel said, referencing the Judicial Council cases on the table at the time regarding her former party.</p>\n<p>“I think at first [the process] was hostile, but I think I did a very good job in being level-headed and open-minded and very open to their suggestions.”</p>\n<p>Kopel also noted that this past election season was more “hostile” than her year’s election had been, stating it was “really disheartening for me,” referencing, in her words, the “anti-Black” and “transphobic” comments made toward former A.S. presidential candidate Zion Solomon on a UCSB Reddit thread.</p>\n<p>“I know elections get really tense. I’ve been through two of them myself and I know people want to win, they want to help this campus, they want to represent students, but that should never come at the expense of someone else’s safety… It’s one thing to critique a platform and it’s another thing to hate on someone’s identity.”</p>\n<p>In reference to the “hostile” nature of elections, Kopel said she has “mixed feelings” about the presence of political parties on campus. While she believes the parties provide platforms for people who “might not have the means otherwise to run for positions,” ultimately, “the negatives outweigh the positives.”</p>\n<p>“Our campus is just a little microcosm of what our federal system looks like –– even though, by no means, is CU or IVP Democrat or Republican –– just having that split from having two parties lends itself to toxicity,” she said.</p>\n<p>“It lends itself to a divide that might not necessarily have to be there if everyone had to run independent or if there was some sort of system where there had to be more than two parties involved.”</p>\n<p>She also <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-30/associated-students-ivp-and-evpsa-elect-removed-from-isla-vista-party/\">touched lightly on her departure from Campus United</a> during Fall Quarter 2018, stating that while she did as much as she could to communicate that departure with the student body, it was ultimately hard to address her departure because parties “aren’t really supposed to be present throughout the course of the year,” as stated in A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p><strong>What Comes Next?</strong></p>\n<p>Kopel will be attending law school at the University of Southern California after she graduates with UCSB’s class of 2019. She hopes to become an immigration lawyer.</p>\n<p>She said her time in the Office of the Student Advocate (OSA), working as a caseworker during her second year at UCSB, was where she “found [her] voice for advocacy.”</p>\n<p>“I was able, as a caseworker, to see the impact I was able to have just on a small scale, but also on such a big scale on individual’s lives… my passion for advocacy has only grown since then.”</p>\n<p>But it was the presidential office in particular that “showed me that advocacy doesn’t necessarily mean having some huge movement accomplished. For me to be a successful advocate it doesn’t mean that I step into the game and get all the demands put through,” emphasizing that, to her, advocacy means “being visible and knowing that people are there for you.”</p>\n<p>In regards to her successor, Sir, Kopel said she hoped to make Sir’s transition into office easier that her own: “The transition was really scary for me. I felt really alone at first… a big priority of mine this year was to try and bridge the gap of transitions that we face every year.”</p>\n<p>But aside from the transition, Kopel’s advice for Sir is: “You have the utmost privilege of serving in this office, of meeting administration and cultivating relations with people you had no idea existed, communities you had no idea existed. Take advantage of literally every email that comes your way, every opportunity that comes your way, get to know this campus in and out.”</p>\n<p>“Treat every day like it’s your first, because it’s never too late to start something new.”</p>\n<p><em><span class=\"_5yl5\">A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the May 16, 2019 print edition of the </span></em><span class=\"_5yl5\">Daily Nexus</span><em><span class=\"_5yl5\">.</span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
