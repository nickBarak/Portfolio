Despite experiencing a 1-0 defeat to Cal State Fullerton in the Big West Championship, UCSB has been predicted to finish atop the Big West North Division standings for the fourth consecutive time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Westmont is hoping to improve upon a 9-6-2 overall, 6-3-1 Golden State Athletic Conference record in 2015. It was a productive offseason for the Warriors as they added a total of nine recruits, one transfer and eight freshmen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although not included in the 2016 NAIA men’s soccer coaches’ preseason top 25 poll, the Warriors may not be too far from ascending into the rankings at some point this season. Their 6-3-1 conference record landed them tied for third place in the standings in addition to four of their players being named to the All-GSAC Team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While expectations are high for the Gauchos to be the premiere team in the Big West North Division, the anticipation for the senior campaign of forward Nick DePuy is at an all-time high after a milestone-filled breakout junior season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crowned the Big West Conference Player of the Year for the second consecutive year, DePuy led the nation in game-winning goals with eight and regular season goals amongst all NCAA players with 15. His impact when on the field for UCSB is inevitable as the Gauchos are 16-0-4 all-time when DePuy scores at least one goal in a match. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both statistical totals led the Big West along with him being the conference leader in points (31) and shots (80). Becoming the fifth Big West player ever to be selected as a NSCAA All-American last season, DePuy was selected to the College Soccer News Preseason All-America First Team. His candidacy on the MAC Hermann Trophy Watch List tops off the fourth-year player’s list of accolades and nominations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alongside DePuy on the Big West Preseason All-Conference Team are junior forward Ahinga Selemani and junior midfielder Kevin Feucht, tying the Gauchos with Cal Poly for the most preseason selections at three players. Despite missing some time due to injury throughout the season, Selemani ranked second on the team in shots with a total of 57 while Feucht finished second on the team in goals with six.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66388\" style=\"width: 282px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66388\" data-attachment-id=\"66388\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/mens_soccer_ucd_111115_eric_swenson_006-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_Soccer_UCD_111115_Eric_Swenson_006-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"Ahinga Selemani crosses the ball in for an unsuccessful attempt on goal.

I’m disappointed for the players but I’m not disappointed with the way we played.”</p>\n<p>The loss ended a five-game unbeaten streak for the Gauchos, who fell to a record of 13-6-2 overall, 7-2-1 conference. With their fourth straight win, the Titans secured their second consecutive Big West title while improving to a 13-7-1 overall, 6-3-1 conference record.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB’s season is not over despite the loss, as it will play in the NCAA Tournament this Sunday. The Gauchos received a first round bye and the No. 15 seed in the tournament and will host the winner between South Carolina and Furman’s first round game which takes place on Thursday.</p>\n<p>“You start the season with one goal in mind and that’s to be the number one team,” Vom Steeg said. “For us, that starts with making the NCAA Tournament. That’s what we strive for.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton also qualifies for the NCAA Tournament for the third consecutive year and will play Santa Clara in the first round on Thursday. Head Coach George Kuntz improved to an outstanding record of 13-1-1 in the Big West Tournament with the win, earning his sixth Big West title in the process.</p>\n<p>In a match that was dominated by the Gauchos from the opening whistle, it felt for much of the game as if the home side was bound to score at any moment. UCSB saw several close scoring chances in the first half clang off the crossbar, including a free kick by sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht from 30 yards out.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara headed into the break with a 9-2 advantage in shots and the game’s only shot on frame through 45 minutes.</p>\n<p>The second half began with a bit of a momentum change as UCSB’s freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg was subbed out due to injury and Fullerton found itself with possession more consistently.</p>\n<p>“Justin’s been dealing with a shoulder issue for about 2-3 weeks now. He warmed up today before the game and dove and he said he just can’t dive to his right,” Tim Vom Steeg said. “Realistically, he’s probably not going to get through the season. Obviously Justin is very disappointed right now.”</p>\n<p>Although recording just two shots in the first half, the Titans doubled that mark in a matter of seconds, as Bell gave Fullerton all it would need to come away with the upset victory. After a throw in, a shot from the right side by senior midfielder Julian Okai came hard off the right post and fell right to Bell, who knocked in his first goal of the season past sophomore goalkeeper Brandon Berke in the 52<sup>nd</sup> minute.</p>\n<p>“When the throw went in, unfortunately [junior midfielder Josue Espana] just couldn’t clear it. It’s just luck, really. They got the ball and they scored,” sophomore center back Fuad Adeniyi said. “Tonight I think the whole back four did a really good job, but unfortunately that’s the game that we play. One slip-up, one mistake can cost you the whole thing.”</p>\n<p>The shocking turnaround forced the Gauchos to go into an all-out offensive mode, putting attacking players in at nearly every position outside of center back. Junior Ismaila Jome led the onslaught down the left wing, beating defenders and sending in a number of crosses for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB finally got the chance it was looking for in the 82<sup>nd</sup> minute, after junior forward Nick DePuy blocked a pass in the midfield which led to his own breakaway. Before the nation’s second-leading goalscorer could get a shot away, he was taken down from behind by Fullerton’s Ricardo Covarrubias just outside the box, who was sent off with a straight red card.</p>\n<p>Playing up a man, the Gauchos continued to send everything they had forward, resulting in their best scoring opportunity of the game in the 85<sup>th</sup> minute. DePuy working a perfect 1-2 combination with freshman defender Sam Strong on the right side of the box, but his right-footed strike went wide of the far post and the Gauchos’ attempted comeback fell short soon after.</p>\n<p>“The sequence with about seven minutes left was our best soccer,” the older Vom Steeg said. “You’ve got Nick at that back post with everything to shoot at and he’s your best scorer. We had him 8 yards out to tie the game up a man and we know where that would’ve gone with them having the red card.”</p>\n<p>DePuy led his team with eight shots, three more than the entire Fullerton team, but UCSB was hurt by the fact that only six of its 22 shots were on goal. It was just the third time all season that Santa Barbara reached the 20-shot mark.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have not won a Big West Championship since 2010 and last played in the final in 2011, when they lost to UC Irvine 3-2. The road to their first NCAA championship since 2006 begins on Sunday when they host either South Carolina or Furman in the NCAA Tournament Second Round.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66505\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66505\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/valiant-effort-from-no-17-ucsb-falls-short-in-big-west-championship/","id":1472,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1471,1470,1469],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Strike First, But No. 2 Clemson Pulls Off Late Sweet Sixteen Winner","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_USC_11.22.15_Eric_Swenson_001-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_USC_11.22.15_Eric_Swenson_001-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The No. 15 seed UCSB men's soccer team's NCAA Tournament run fell just short in the Sweet Sixteen at No. 2 Clemson.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_66833\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_USC_11.22.15_Eric_Swenson_001-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"763315608\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66839\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66833\" data-attachment-id=\"66833\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-30/gauchos-strike-first-but-no-2-clemson-pulls-off-late-sweet-sixteen-winner/nick-depuy-attempts-to-header-the-ball-eric-swensondaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_USC_11.22.15_Eric_Swenson_001-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"Nick DePuy attempts to header the ball.

They will host a No. 10 Maryland team coming off a 2-1 upset over No. 7 Notre Dame yesterday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In a game which saw UCSB in control for much of the first half, it was the Gauchos who got on the board first. A deep cross sent in by freshman forward Cody Gibson was headed back towards the middle of the box by junior midfielder Josue Espana in the 39<sup>th</sup> minute. First to the ball was junior midfielder Seo-In Kim, who headed it home for his second goal of the season.</p>\n<p>Much to the dismay of UCSB Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg, it didn’t take long for Clemson to answer back. Just minutes later, Tiger junior defender Aaron Jones came out of the midfield to beat several Gaucho defenders before blasting in a shot from 25 yards out to beat freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg, giving him the first goal of his career. The crucial equalizer came with just 57 seconds left in the half, sending the teams into the break tied 1-1.</p>\n<p>The younger Vom Steeg, who was making his NCAA Tournament debut after missing last week’s matchup with South Carolina, was put under much pressure in the second half as the Gauchos were outshot 7-4.</p>\n<p>Playing with more possession and control in the second stanza, the Tigers took their first lead of the game in the 69<sup>th</sup> minute off sophomore forward Diego Campos’s fourth goal of the year. Dribbling along the edge of the 18-yard box, Campos fired a shot in towards the top left corner of the net, giving Clemson its second long-range score of the game.</p>\n<p>As has been the case multiple times this season, it didn’t take long for UCSB to respond to its second half concession. Just 49 seconds after going down, sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht intercepted a back pass intended for the Clemson keeper to score his sixth goal of the year and tie it at 2-2. Feucht’s six goals this season were good for second-best on the team in just his first year at UCSB.</p>\n<p>With the game anyone’s to win, it was Clemson redshirt senior Kyle Murphy who ended up scoring the decisive goal to break the deadlock in the 79<sup>th</sup> minute. A string of four straight first-time passes, the last of which came from sophomore midfielder Saul Chinchilla on a perfect cross in from the right wing, resulted in a tap in goal by Murphy from eight yards out to give him eight on the year.</p>\n<p>UCSB matched Clemson with 12 shots on the night, but the Tigers put an efficient seven shots on target, resulting in four saves by Vom Steeg. Meanwhile, Santa Barbara was only able to get a third of its shots on frame, forcing junior goalkeeper Andrew Tarbell to make just two saves in the game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ year ends after making their seventh Sweet Sixteen appearance in program history and 13<sup>th</sup> postseason appearance in the last 14 seasons. They lose a group of seniors that includes All-Big West First Teamer Duncan Backus, starting center back Brandon Brockway, and midfielders Adam Carn-Saferstein and Christian Rodriguez.</p>\n<p>Retaining key members of its core group, including juniors Nick DePuy, Ismaila Jome and Josue Espana, as well as young studs in Feucht, freshman Geoffrey Acheampong and sophomore Ahinga Selemani, UCSB will be a force to reckon with heading into the 2016 season as it looks to get over the hump and make another run for what would be its second NCAA Championship in school history.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

This Tuesday at the Arlington Theatre in downtown Santa Barbara, hundreds of fans were given the chance to admire the United States’ current standard of excellence and listen to the inspiring story of a woman who has helped change what the sport of soccer means across the country.</p>\n<p>“Life has changed tremendously, and for a good reason,” Lloyd said about the past year. “Women’s soccer has changed and our team has just transcended the game. We’ve reached heights that have been amazing. I’m still Carli from New Jersey and I still train hard on that, but my surroundings have changed.”</p>\n<p>Though her name may not be the most recognizable in the U.S. behind the likes of Landon Donovan and Abby Wambach, widely considered the greatest male and female American soccer players ever, when it has mattered most, Lloyd has been the one to step up for her country, and it’s not even debatable.</p>\n<p>Since 2008, the United States has reached the final match of the Olympics or the World Cup — the two most important finals the country can reach — a total of four times, coming out as the victor in three out of four of those matches.</p>\n<p>In its three final wins, the U.S. scored a total of eight goals. Carli Lloyd scored six of them.</p>\n<p>Now, for anyone familiar with the sport, it is a well-known fact that soccer isn’t all about goals; just ask any excellent midfielder who has been overshadowed by a forward that puts up better looking numbers than they do.</p>\n<p>In this case though, especially in a country that tends to reward tangible statistics as more valuable than the true impact any player brings to a given team, it is nice to see a U.S. athlete that is both rewarded with, and indisputably considered to be deserving of, the award.</p>\n<p>“What you see is what you get with me,” Lloyd said. “I don’t do it to be cool. I do it because that’s who I am as a person.”</p>\n<p>After a highlight reel of some of Lloyd’s greatest moments opened up the night, the eighth-most capped player in U.S. women’s soccer history with 212 career appearances came onto the stage to an ecstatic reception and was showered with applause throughout the night. After catching the audience up on her latest exploits, including a hat-trick against Ireland just five days ago, she was ready to give advice to the hundreds of young girls and boys in the crowd on what it takes to reach the highest level of soccer.</p>\n<p>“It’s not enough to just practice it a couple times a week. You basically have to do more than the person next to you, and that’s sort of my motto,” Lloyd said. “I train on every holiday — Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving — because I know that nobody else is training, and that gives me the extra edge. You look at every other person in this world that’s successful; Steve Jobs knocked on every person’s door, and the 50th person said, ‘Okay, I like your idea,’ and now everybody here has an Apple product. It’s just about being persistent and working hard towards that dream and goal of yours.”</p>\n<p>Now at the age of 33 and standing atop the world of women’s soccer, Lloyd has cemented her place in the history of the sport. However, as many in the audience found out Tuesday night, she did not have the easiest path to stardom.</p>\n<p>“Throughout my youth days, I was always the best on my team. I practiced a lot, I was super passionate about soccer,” Lloyd recounted. “Then, I get selected for the U-21 National Team, and I was like, ‘Wow, I’m not that good.’”</p>\n<p>At that point, Lloyd went from being the perennial top player on her team to someone who had to compete to get on the field at all.</p>\n<p>“My third year, my coach, Chris Petrucelli, was the first one to be fully honest with me, and he basically told me, ‘You’ve got loads of talent, but you’re not displaying it, you’re not working hard enough, you’re not fit,’” Lloyd said. “That was the first moment in my life that I had actually heard criticism and I was like, ‘What is this about? I’m 22, I’m perfect.’”</p>\n<p>After approaching her parents about her concerns over whether or not she should continue to pursue a career in soccer, Lloyd was lucky to be paired with trainer James Galanis, who had landed a job coaching her brother’s soccer team close to where Carli lived.<br>\n“James basically told everybody that he was going to get me on the national team and turn me into one of the best players in the world, and everybody laughed at him,” Lloyd said. “We’ve been working towards this dream and goal for the last 13 years, and here we are today.”</p>\n<p>Lloyd was then asked to recall her experiences playing for the USWNT, from her nervous first cap to the Americans’ dominant World Cup winning run in 2015 in which she was awarded the Golden Ball for the tournament’s top player.</p>\n<p>The moment that most fans could have expected, and one which Lloyd has surely come to be exhausted with talking about over the past six months, finally came when the 2015 World Cup Final against Japan was brought up.</p>\n<p>After the U.S. fell to Japan in a penalty shootout in the 2011 World Cup Final, the following four years were a journey of redemption for Lloyd and her teammates as they looked to finish atop the rest of the world for the first time since 1999. Thanks to Lloyd’s brilliant first half performance this past June, which saw her not only record a hat-trick through the first 16 minutes, but also arguably the most memorable goal in U.S. soccer history on a chip-shot from the midfield line, the Americans went on to a convincing 5-2 victory.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1CT3xQOfng?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“I remember looking at the clock 22 minutes in and thinking, ‘Just blow the whistle,’” Lloyd said. “When that whistle blew I was just so mentally and physically drained, I just dropped to my knees. You almost just want that moment to pause, because it’s over in the blink of an eye.”</p>\n<p>After years of watching the United States’ No. 10 jersey dominate the world at the highest level of women’s soccer, it was a surreal experience to be seated so close to her that when I swallowed water down the wrong pipe and began coughing uncontrollably, I was faced with the fear that I might distract her in the middle of her speech.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, that either didn’t happen, or she was professional enough to ignore it and continue speaking with a level of class and humility unmatched by any of her peers that I have had the chance to witness. Not surprisingly, one of the most pertinent topics of the hour and 15 minutes she spent on stage was the impact that she and her team have had on the American youth.</p>\n<p>“If I can be a role model and help inspire all these younger generations, that to me is priceless,” Lloyd said. “I want to instill values and things that you should do on and off the field so that all of you young folks watching can pick up on those things.”</p>\n<p>I still remember the first game I ever saw of the USWNT, in an exhibition all the way back in 2007. The men were coming off a disappointing group stage knockout in the 2006 World Cup in Germany, and soccer remained an unimportant sport in the world of sports in America.</p>\n<p>Yet, despite the United States’ lack of awareness for the most popular sport on the globe, I thought to myself, ‘This team is amazing. They could beat the men if they played them.’ Since that time, Lloyd and her teammates, including Wambach, Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan and many others, have helped transform the meaning of soccer in America and prove that it deserves a spot alongside the country’s other major sports.</p>\n<p>Don’t believe me? How about the fact that the U.S.-Japan World Cup Final in 2015 was the most-watched soccer match in U.S. history, bringing in 25.4 million viewers across the nation and 61 million worldwide?</p>\n<p>Or how about the fact that FIFA 16, the latest installment of the world’s best-selling sports game, featured the USWNT’s own Alex Morgan on the cover and gave players the chance to use women’s soccer athletes for the first time in history?</p>\n<p>Or how about the fact that the National Women’s Soccer League, founded in 2012, is heading into its fourth season, surpassing the three-year expiration date that faced both the Women’s United Soccer Association and Women’s Professional Soccer in 2003 and 2012, respectively?</p>\n<p>“We’re now entering our fourth year, which is a good sign,” Lloyd said. “The awareness is good. We just have to continue to sell seats and get people to the games.”</p>\n<p>Thanks to the efforts of Lloyd and the rest of the USWNT, soccer has discovered a new meaning in the United States. Now, the world’s top player and her peers are only concerned with how to carry on with that progress and continue inspiring young athletes everywhere to make their own mark on the sport.</p>\n<p>“We’re really transforming the sport, it just continues to get better,” Lloyd said. “The ‘99 World Cup was a big turning point. The last couple years have been a huge turning point, and a couple years from now when I hang up my boots, I hope it’ll be better than it is now.”</p>\n<p>The young soccer players in the audience who shared Lloyd’s love of the sport didn’t have to look far for the right role model to help them get where they want to be someday.</p>\n<p>She may be sitting atop the pinnacle of world soccer today, but regardless of who she is now, Carli Lloyd was once just a girl from Jersey with dreams of making it big.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67728\" style=\"width: 408px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67728\" data-attachment-id=\"67728\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/carli-lloyd/carli-lloyd-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carli-lloyd.png?fit=2940%2C2607&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2940,2607\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"carli lloyd\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carli-lloyd.png?fit=250%2C222&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carli-lloyd.png?fit=888%2C787&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67728\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carli-lloyd.png?resize=398%2C353\" alt=\"carli lloyd\" width=\"398\" height=\"353\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carli-lloyd.png?w=2940&amp;ssl=1 2940w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carli-lloyd.png?resize=250%2C222&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carli-lloyd.png?resize=768%2C681&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carli-lloyd.png?resize=1024%2C908&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carli-lloyd.png?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carli-lloyd.png?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67728\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tarush Mohanti / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page  of January 28, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67618\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/carli-lloyd/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67618\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/carli-lloyd/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/carli-lloyd/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/carli-lloyd/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/carli-lloyd/","id":1471,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1470,1469,1468],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
