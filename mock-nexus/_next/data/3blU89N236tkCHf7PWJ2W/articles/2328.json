The center would provide legal assistance for survivors of sexual assault and would recieve support from A.S. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The demand calls for a survivor resource center that will “lead programming efforts to spread awareness among the student body and throughout the off campus Isla Vista community.”</p>\n<p>The center will also require a full-time director and staff, as well as legal service for sexual assault survivors.</p>\n<p>Students at the Tuesday’s meeting asked that the center be effective for underrepresented communities, which they said should help in creating and managing the center.</p>\n<p>The university requested $56,000 to secure the help of the Alliance for HOPE, a nonprofit agency that develops family justice centers to protect and heal sexual assault survivors and their families.</p>\n<p>The university submitted the funding request in December, but the status will not be known until “spring time” of this year, said C.A.R.E. Director Briana Conway during the meeting.</p>\n<p>An additional assessment proposal provides a “blueprint” for all constituents involved in planning the creation of a survivor resource center, Conway added.</p>\n<p>Students expressed concern that collaborating with outside entities might not be effective in authentically representing the marginalized communities that the center aims to support.</p>\n<p>Third-year communications major Jasmine Lee said a more concrete timeline of the two-year assessment proposal and the university funding request status would help student organizers search for alternate sources of funding.</p>\n<p>She said the university needs to communicate with students about the financing process so they can take action as the funding comes through.</p>\n<p>Katya Armistead, Dean of Student Life, said during the meeting that it can be “helpful to bring in an outsider to facilitate” the creation of the center.</p>\n<p>Armistead also said the university must apply for grants in order to build the center. But the university already has other grants lined up, which might delay the approval of a grant for the center, she said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Justice Dumlao requested that the center be part of the Associated Students Boards, Commissions and Units so the center can work closely and partner with student organizations and campus departments.</p>\n<p>“This is not going to be C.A.R.E. out in I.V.,” Conway said, referring to the Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education program. “This is a separate, distinct resource.” Conway also explained that the center will be its own entity, independent from existing UCSB sexual assault survivor resources.</p>\n<p>C.A.R.E. will still be a “strong partner” moving forward with the center, Conway added.</p>\n<p>“This needs to be bigger than just C.A.R.E.,” she said.</p>\n<p>There will be a follow-up meeting to further discuss the demand on March 6 at the Student Resource Building.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 3 of the Feb. 22, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81451\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/students-discuss-survivor-resource-center-at-sexual-assault-town-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81451\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/students-discuss-survivor-resource-center-at-sexual-assault-town-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/students-discuss-survivor-resource-center-at-sexual-assault-town-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/students-discuss-survivor-resource-center-at-sexual-assault-town-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/students-discuss-survivor-resource-center-at-sexual-assault-town-hall/","id":2328,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2327,2326,2325],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio","biography":"Not available","articles":[2295,2312,2322,2324,2328,2330,2357,2358,2388,2393,2394,2395,2397,2399,2408,2718,2720,2772,3572,3612,3654,3768,3803,3822,3826,3923,3924,3929,3959,4360,4444],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Is It Cool to Juul?

According to the California College and <a href=\"http://cyanonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CA-College-SmokeTobacco-Free-Report-Card-2016.pdf\">University Smoke/Tobacco-Free Policy Report Card</a>, secondhand “e-cigarette aerosol is a new source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and ultrafine/fine particles.”</p>\n<p>Studies from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the UC Office of the President reveal that around 16 percent of the college-age population and 8 percent of University of California students vape or handle similar nicotine products. The Report Card also says that in Calif., young adults are three times as likely to use e-cigarettes than adults over 30.</p>\n<p>Devices like JUUL, PHIX and similar models are among the most common e-cig products in use among students.</p>\n<p>According to the Report Card, UC Santa Barbara is 100 percent smoke and tobacco free, including e-cigarettes. Despite this, UCSB has not escaped this new fad, and these devices “are a rising concern for UCSB,” according to UCSB’s Alcohol and Drug Program.</p>\n<p>The CDC and the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department warn that these products can hurt the respiratory system “just like traditional cigarette smoke can,” and the addictive properties of the chemical make it just as harmful for psychological health.</p>\n<p>Madison Barnes, a tobacco cessation educator at UCSB, explained that the consequences of vaping are normally not taken into consideration by users.</p>\n<p>“Vaping and e-cigarettes are a rising concern for UCSB as many students believe they are a healthier alternative to smoking cigarettes,” she said.</p>\n<p>Currently, UCSB actively works towards limiting use and providing various resources to get addicted students off these products.</p>\n<p>One of these resources is the Alcohol and Drug Program, which offers support services to students that include free addiction cessation products and psychological advising in order to help afflicted students.</p>\n<p>But even with the seeming decline of traditional smoking use and the ongoing efforts of UCSB’s administration to limit other forms of nicotine consumption, major challenges still remain to halt addiction across the student population.</p>\n<p>One student, who asked to remain anonymous due to housing regulations, explained that the dissipating smell of the vape and the strength of the nicotine makes it an ideal illegal substance in small areas like the dorms.</p>\n<p>However, because of the high nicotine concentration in the devices, vapes can make users extremely susceptible to addiction.</p>\n<p>Nik Babourine, first-year mathematics major, said he has met students in the Santa Catalina halls “that can’t even stay focused in group study sessions because they need to leave to get their Juul.”</p>\n<p>Michael Takahara from UCSB’s Smoke and Tobacco Free steering committee explained that efforts to keep students from consuming nicotine will counter efforts of companies that supply these products.</p>\n<p>“New ways of delivering nicotine to the body will continue to evolve as the Tobacco Industry works at creating new life long customers,” Takahara said in an email.</p>\n<p>As newer methods and trends of nicotine consumption rise, UCSB’s various support services and policymakers “will continue to learn about them and address them” for the foreseeable future, Takahara said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 5 of the March 1, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senate meeting. It states that UCSB should partner with Sprigeo, a third-party vendor, to offer students a 24/7 mobile application, webform, text hotline, phone hotline and email hotline to report a crime.</p>\n<p>If the Senate passes the resolution, A.S. would establish a contract with Sprigeo for the service and “widely publicize” the app to incoming students as a way to report sexual assault on campus and in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of partnering with this company is that so many resources in Associated Students are available and we pay for them, but no students know they exist or they don’t know how to access them, and that’s a huge issue,” said Senator Kristen Armellini, who co-authored the resolution with Senator Grecia Martinez.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Matan Bostick sponsored the resolution.</p>\n<p>The Sprigeo app would allow students to anonymously report offenses that would then be processed by “designated university officials and [be] appropriately and confidentially responded to in prompt fashion,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>Following a lengthy debate, the Senate sent the resolution to External Affairs to be discussed further.</p>\n<p>Before voting, some senators expressed disappointment with how the subject was approached.</p>\n<p>Senator Alexandra Gessesse said that the Senate had last spoken to Bostick two weeks before, but that the updated resolution was “slapped on” the night before the meeting.</p>\n<p>She added that the resolution should have been created in conjunction with current student efforts to combat sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“The reason why I have a problem with [the resolution] is that no one is doing anything unless it makes them look real good, or they care about it and they’re caring about it when they’re not prioritizing other issues,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>The amount of time allotted to work on the resolution was also a point of concern for some senators because of the sensitivity of the topic.</p>\n<p>“This resolution shouldn’t be worked in a week. It should be worked in one month, two months, three months,” Senator Andrea Reyes said.</p>\n<p>Another issue addressed was the use of the names of two UCSB alumni in the resolution.</p>\n<p>The alumni mentioned have previously hosted sit-ins regarding sexual assault. The first was held by Alejandra Melgoza in <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">May 2015</a> and lasted for 13 hours; the second was led by Ro’Shawndra Earvin in May 2017 and lasted for nine hours.</p>\n<p>In both instances, Chancellor Henry T. Yang agreed to the students’ <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/nowUCsb13InitialDemandsforChancellorYang.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">respective demands</a>, although Earvin has continued fighting for the completion of the demands, most recently at a Feb. 8 <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-09/sexual-assault-survivors-raise-frustrations-over-unresolved-demands/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Town Hall meeting</a>.</p>\n<p>Both Melgoza and Earvin said they were not contacted by the authors of the resolution or asked to have their names included.</p>\n<p>“Using my name without consent is perpetuating the same acts of violence,” Melgoza said during public forum.</p>\n<p>Armellini spoke about the intentions of the resolution, saying it came “prematurely” to the senate and that it “needs work”.</p>\n<p>“In no way was this resolution supposed to produce this anxiety and uproar,” she said.</p>\n<p>Currently, students can report incidents of sexual assault through the UCSB Police Department (UCPD) if the incident occurs on campus or through the Title IX &amp; Sexual Harassment Policy Compliance Office. Local law enforcement like the Isla Vista Foot Patrol can address an incident if it occurred off campus.</p>\n<p>Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) is another campus resource students can use to anonymously report sexual assault. Students can go online to file a report, which will then be forwarded to UCPD and other campus offices.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80961\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-10/student-proposes-phone-app-for-reporting-sexual-assault/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80961\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-10/student-proposes-phone-app-for-reporting-sexual-assault/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-10/student-proposes-phone-app-for-reporting-sexual-assault/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-10/student-proposes-phone-app-for-reporting-sexual-assault/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-10/student-proposes-phone-app-for-reporting-sexual-assault/","id":2326,"author":{"id":81,"name":"Victoria Gurrola"},"related":[2325,2324,2323],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCen Project Will Be on A.S.

President Hieu Le began gathering signatures for the project during the week of Feb. 26. <em>Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The University Center Renovation Project will be on the Associated Students spring elections ballot, according to A.S. President Hieu Le, who has been petitioning to get the project on the ballot over the past three weeks.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had the fortunate opportunity to speak with thousands of students on this campus,” Le said. “Now, students will be given that opportunity to decide the future of our campus and for the future of tomorrow’s generation.”</p>\n<p>Approximately 3,500 undergraduate students signed the petition, according to Le. In order to get the project on the ballot, Le needed to collect 3,116 signatures by the March 16 deadline.</p>\n<p>“[The number] is well above the mark that we needed to be, which only shows that there is a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of support from the campus, from the student body, around this proposal,” Le said.</p>\n<p>The project, a collaboration between A.S., the Division of Student Affairs and the University Center (UCen) Governance Board, was introduced as a resolution to the A.S. Senate during a Jan. 31 <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/student-fees-may-spike-with-ucen-remodel/\">Senate meeting</a>, where it was tabled indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Senate passed a second resolution later than night, affirming support for the project. Le and volunteers began petitioning the ballot during the week of Feb. 26.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been able to hear what [students’] concerns are about their day to day issues, but at the same time we’ve been able to present this exciting and thrilling opportunity for students to consider voting for the UCen renovation expansion,” Le said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Board and career staff members involved in the elections process verified the number of signatures and student perm numbers to make sure that each is valid, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“In our process we’ve been very diligent in the educational process in ensuring that students are informed about the issue, about the benefits and also what it would cost, and what the investment would be,” he said.</p>\n<p>Le said he and others who gathered signatures were “transparent” when petitioning to students.</p>\n<p>“Our process holds the highest standards of integrity,” he said.</p>\n<p>The petition outlines a need for a 24-hour study space, an innovation laboratory, a health and wellness center, additional Campus Learning Assistance Services (CLAS) classrooms, expanded mental health peer counseling for Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.), the expansion of the A.S. Food Bank, a campus pub and infrastructure upgrades for the UCen.</p>\n<p>“When we think of facilities such as the [Student Resource Building], or the [Recreation Center], facilities financed primarily by student investment dollars, it was students 10, 20, 30 years ago who decided to make this happen for us today, for us to have access to those resources,” Le said.</p>\n<p>The project needs 50 percent + 1 “yes” votes for it to be implemented.</p>\n<p>If students vote in favor of the project, a $21.42 quarterly fee will be added to student fees until Fall 2022. Between fall 2022 and fall 2052, an additional $99.61 a quarter will be added to the fees, though that cost will progressively increase each year to match inflation.</p>\n<p>If passed, construction on the project will be completed by fall 2022. Additional fees will continue until 2052, according to the petition.</p>\n<p>Officials initially stated that the renovation would cost $48 million, but students would <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/\">pay more</a> to fund the project.</p>\n<p>“I think this is something that each student will have to weigh themselves and see whether or not this is needed for our campus,” Le said. “But I myself am very supportive, and I’m supportive of the right for student autonomy to decide for themselves whether this should proceed or not.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
