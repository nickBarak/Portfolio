Speaking at the UC Regents meeting, Munger said he envisions the dormitories as “the best undergraduate housing in the world.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“What fascinated me was 28 acres on the ocean, combined with massive stupidity. I like to fix massive stupidity.” — Charles Munger</p></blockquote>\n<p>As Vice-Chairman for Berkshire Hathaway, Munger is currently partner to one of the world’s richest people, Warren Buffet.</p>\n<p>The construction is designed to reduce undergraduate housing costs by as much as 60 percent, and plans for two six-story buildings built on a base of pre-cast concrete. The buildings will have kitchens to reduce meal plan costs, and the top floor of each design will be dedicated to six acres of common room space.</p>\n<p>“Every campus I know of in the world abuses its undergraduates … it finally gets pretty gross,” Munger said, emphasizing the importance of healthy living areas.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69147\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"93804457\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69145\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69147\" data-attachment-id=\"69147\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/billionaire-donates-200m-to-fix-gross-dorms/screen-shot-2016-03-28-at-3-21-53-pm-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?fit=501%2C370&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"501,370\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2016-03-28 at 3.21.53 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?fit=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?fit=501%2C370&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69147\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?resize=350%2C258\" width=\"350\" height=\"258\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?w=501&amp;ssl=1 501w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-3.21.53-PM-1.png?resize=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69147\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Munger’s dorms will replace Santa Cruz, Anacapa, Santa Rosa, San Miguel and San Nicolas Hall.</p></div>\n<p>To accommodate for high student density, Munger plans to replace real windows in several rooms with artificial windows, inspired by artificial portholes on Disney cruise lines which feature “a starfish that comes by and winks at your kid,” said Munger.</p>\n<p>Matilda Mead, third-year psychology major and Residence Hall Association President, said although “overwhelmed by his generosity,” she was disappointed by the conditions of Munger’s donation.</p>\n<p>“By replacing the those views with his artificial windows, it seems to me as though we would be neglecting our residents from experiencing a large aspect of what they came to UCSB to see: the picturesque scenery,” Mead said. “Besides, I highly doubt any artificial windows would be able to replicate [or] replace our spectacular sunsets.”</p>\n<p>According to Mead, mental health and academic resources are “severely lacking” on campus, and the best use for Munger’s donation would be to build additional support spaces for students.</p>\n<p>“I just hope he can look at the whole picture and focus on the needs of our residents rather than the aesthetics of our university when determining where his donation will go,” Mead said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Chancellor Henry T.

If the UC does not continue to support him, Munger will go elsewhere with his plan, but he is enthusiastic about developing at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The UC System has the power of eminent domain,” Munger said. “If it really makes sense to revolutionize housing for the better on one campus, it can be done on other campuses.”</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: An earlier version of this article did not include San Miguel and San Nicolas dorms in the list of residences that will be replaced.

Awards Dinner on Wednesday in Corwin Pavilion.</p>\n<p>UCSB First was able to award grants to seven more campus organizations than last year. The five winners of $250 grants were Kappa Kappa Gamma, Greeks 4 Kids, Gamma Zeta Alpha, Dance Marathon and Swipe Out Hunger. The six winners of $500 grants were Queer Art Collective, Global Medical Brigades, Zeta Beta Tau, Street Health Outreach, Phi Delta Epsilon and Love Your Melon.</p>\n<p>Chris Pizzinat, deputy director of UCSB’s Office of Development, said those who participate in charity work should be honored for the example they set.</p>\n<p>“Philanthropy is not inherently ingrained in everyone, giving back is a largely learned value,” Pizzinat said. “It is emulated by those who feel an ownership of either an organization, a community or a cause. [These groups] are ones who teach these concepts to others through example. We are proud of what they are accomplishing and the impact of their work and we wish them much success.”</p>\n<p>According to Madison Frame, UCSB First co-chair and third-year psychology major, the campus organizations turned in applications describing their philanthropic work to be considered for the grant. Frame said UCSB First closely scrutinized applicant groups.</p>\n<p>“We chose the winners with the help of our committee, looking through all the applications and had a sort of rubric to help guide the committee members in evaluating how worthy the applicants were of receiving a grant,” Frame said. “The applications go through several checks with our advisors, with the committee and we even involved the Office of Student Life to ensure every component is accounted for.”</p>\n<p>Megan Jones, UCSB First co-chair and third-year communication and global studies double major, said UCSB First chose grant winners in part based on how they have expressed gratitude to donors in the past.</p>\n<p>“An interesting part of our rubric is based on the involvement the organization will have with the donors who gave these grants and are sponsoring in honor of their work,” Jones said. “It was something we really took into consideration because philanthropy gratitude is something we really emphasize.”</p>\n<p>Kelli Kaesberg, philanthropy chairperson of Kappa Kappa Gamma, said the sorority will most likely use the grant to plan a springtime philanthropy event for a charity that provides books for children in need.</p>\n<p>“We just had our fall and winter philanthropy events and since they were so successful, I think we’d be able to pull off a springtime philanthropy event where most of the proceeds would go to Reading is Fundamental,” Kaesberg said.</p>\n<p>Lynn Padlipsky, executive director of Dance Marathon and fourth-year biology major, said the grant will go toward next year’s Dance Marathon event.</p>\n<p>“The money we were given tonight will go to helping us start the planning for next year’s Dance Marathon event, where it will be bigger and better than this year’s,” Padlipsky said. “And all the money we raise then will go to Cottage Children’s Hospital.”</p>\n<p>Aimee Michelle, co-chair of Queer Art Collective and third-year CCS art and sociology double major, said she believes the organization was chosen for the grant due to its quickly growing presence on campus.</p>\n<p>“I think they chose us because we just started this organization this year,” Michelle said. “We already put on a $19,000 event and we’re already working with a lot of other groups even if we just started.”</p>\n<p>According to Xara Lopez, co-chair of Queer Art Collective, the money will be used to support queer students’ artistic expressions.</p>\n<p>“The money is going to go to supporting a lot of our new ventures,” Lopez said. “We specifically want to have spaces for queer students who express themselves artistically, so one of the main blocks we had was art supplies and those things cost a lot of money.”</p>\n<p>Caitie Mathias, president of Global Medical Brigades, said the organization will use its grant for medicine needed for its summer trip to Honduras.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to use this money to pay for medications to go to Honduras in the summer,” Mathias said.  “Medications cost a lot of money and we see about 1,200 patients while we’re there and it’s kind of scary when we’re close to running out of medications, so every bit counts.”</p>\n<p>Mathias said her organization “promotes self-sustainability” in the communities in which it works, which she believes is why it was chosen for a grant.</p>\n<p>“At the end of our clinic we have a public health lesson for all the people in the community,” Mathias said. “Adults have their own public lesson about nutrition, family-planning, STDs and then we have a health lesson for the children and we teach them about brushing their teeth and other health things. We’re there to make lasting changes.”</p>\n<p>Jennifer Linares, public relations manager for Love Your Melon, said the organization was surprised to receive a grant, being such a young organization.</p>\n<p>“We’re just starting off on campus and not a lot of people know about us,” Linares said. “We just started here in November but we’re not an official organization on campus until Spring Quarter, so getting the award feels really great that they acknowledged out work.”</p>\n<p>According to Fanzana Chapman, secretary for Love Your Melon, she believes the organization was selected because of the unique nature of its work providing hats for children with cancer.</p>\n<p>“I think one of the reasons why is we don’t hear very often [of] clubs that are supporting child cancer awareness,” Chapman said. “We do hear things like breast cancer or cancer awareness but for Love Your Melon, this will be the first club establishment here at UCSB. I think it’s something where you hear it’s unique and something that is here for the first time.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68848\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/ucsb-first-awards-grants-to-campus-philanthropies/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68848\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/ucsb-first-awards-grants-to-campus-philanthropies/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/ucsb-first-awards-grants-to-campus-philanthropies/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/ucsb-first-awards-grants-to-campus-philanthropies/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/ucsb-first-awards-grants-to-campus-philanthropies/","id":2518,"author":{"id":125,"name":"Dahyana Barraza"},"related":[2517,2516,2515],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate met Wednesday in the Flying A Room of the UCen to discuss resolutions supporting free speech, divestment from Turkey, honoraria reform and implementation of the Single Transferable Vote (STV).</p>\n<p>During public forum, fourth-year political science major Brandon Morse presented “A Resolution in Support of Free Speech.” Morse showed the senate a seven-foot “free speech ball” covered in students’ ideas written in black marker.</p>\n<p>“We had a lot of people, we had several hundred people, sign this ball,” Morse said. “There’s some really offensive things that are written on here.”</p>\n<p>Morse said students have the right to express themselves in any area on campus, not only in ‘free speech zones.’</p>\n<p>“We have ‘Fuck Trump’ written on here about nine times, because people just really don’t like Trump. We have people that say ‘Fuck Bernie,’ we have people that drew a picture of Mohammed on here,” Morse said. “I mean there’s a lot of really offensive things that are on this ball right now, but it is right of the students to make all of these statements and all of these drawings on this ball, not only in the free speech zones, but anywhere here on campus.”</p>\n<p>Senate also passed “A Resolution in Support of Free Speech” unanimously.</p>\n<p>Sose Abraamyan, vice president of the Armenian Student Association, presented “Resolution To Divest from the Republic of Turkey.” Abraamyan said the resolution aims to hold the UC Board of Regents responsible for investing in country that perpetuates the denial of the Armenian Genocide.</p>\n<p>“Along with continued violations of human rights to this day…we want to hold UCSB and the UC Regents accountable for ethical investments of student tuition,” Abraamyan said.</p>\n<p>Abraamyan said the resolution is not a “smear campaign” against Turkey.</p>\n<p>“What we don’t want to do is target any specific groups of people, culture, religion, language or any student group on campus,” Abraamyan said.</p>\n<p>Senate passed the resolution in a ‘roll call’ 21-0-1 vote.</p>\n<p>After Public Forum, Senators passed honoraria for the Winter Quarter, which is similar to the system of wage stipends. All senators requested full honoraria of $430, but half did not receive the full amount. Senators may be denied full honoraria due to an absence, speaking out of order or missing Senate retreat.</p>\n<p>Senate also discussed “A Bill To Reform Honoraria.”</p>\n<p>Louis Mariano, off-campus senator and third-year political science major, said Senate should not support capping honoraria for the specialized side-committees of A.S, which are called Boards, Commissions and Units (BCUs). Mariano argued that certain BCUs currently have the budget for full honoraria and should not be unfairly restricted.</p>\n<p>However, Sara Maroofi, engineering collegiate senator and fourth-year mechanical engineering major, said the bill would not go in effect until the next school year, giving BCUs time to adjust their budget.</p>\n<p>“This bill doesn’t get put into place until next school year so it doesn’t affect the budget that current BCUs have for honoraria this year,” Maroofi said.</p>\n<p>The bill was passed by senate in a 16-3-2 hand vote.</p>\n<p>Mathew Burciaga, executive managing editor of <em>The Bottom Line </em>and fourth-year history major, said he was upset by the passing of the honoraria cap.</p>\n<p>“I’m disappointed in you as an organization. In my own opinion, you have created an atmosphere of toxicity, pettiness and hyper-partisanship,” Burciaga said. “The fact that none of you have done more than bat an eye at the fact that five of your colleagues are no longer on the table is astonishing.”</p>\n<p>Burciaga said Senate did not represent his interests as a student.</p>\n<p>“I’d like to remind you of your duties — you are here neither to quarrel among yourselves nor engage in politicking; you are here to represent the interests of the student body and the greater UCSB community,” Burciaga said. “As a student, I cannot say you represent my interests. As a student, I’m saddened to say I’ve lost faith in you as an entity.”</p>\n<p>Senate then began a discussion of STV, a ranked voting system aimed at creating more proportional representation. When casting a vote as an STV, the vote transfers candidates as the options are narrowed down. Each voter selects their preferences and the vote abides by these choices as candidates are narrowed down. A.S. will use STV for senate elections starting in spring 2016.</p>\n<p>According to Stevan Abdalmalik, third-year political science major, STV has increased voter turnout in places where it has been implemented.</p>\n<p>“Every other instance where STV has gone up as the election system, voter turnout has increased,” Abdamalik said. “Voter turnout increases with Single Transferable Vote. What more evidence do you need than all the schools that actually have this, having higher voter turnout?”</p>\n<p>During the President’s cabinet report, A.S. attorney general Hector Contreras announced his resignation.</p>\n<p>“Today will be my final Senate meeting,” Contreras said. “I sent in my letter of resignation a couple of weeks ago to both [A.S. Internal Vice President] Kimia [Hashemian] and [A.S. President] Jimmy Villarreal. I’ve been in A.S. for two and a half years and the dynamics have certainly changed a lot.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68876\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/a-s-senators-approve-free-speech-resolution-a-s-attorney-general-resigns/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68876\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/a-s-senators-approve-free-speech-resolution-a-s-attorney-general-resigns/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/a-s-senators-approve-free-speech-resolution-a-s-attorney-general-resigns/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/a-s-senators-approve-free-speech-resolution-a-s-attorney-general-resigns/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/a-s-senators-approve-free-speech-resolution-a-s-attorney-general-resigns/","id":2520,"author":{"id":126,"name":"Christian Perez"},"related":[2519,2518,2517],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
