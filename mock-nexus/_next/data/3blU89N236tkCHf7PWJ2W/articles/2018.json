According to Stephany Romero, assistant director of UCSB Orientation Programs &amp; Parent Services, the change came about after she recognized the demand for the full program in Spanish and got to work recruiting department representatives for Spanish workshops.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Romero assembled the Orientation for Spanish-Speaking Parents Committee with colleagues from various departments, such as the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and the College of Letters and Science, and began the task of translating.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were able to translate a lot of the material that is already in our English orientation into Spanish and quickly find presenters from those offices to do those presentations,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quick turnaround necessary for the program, along with the task of translating, did not give the Orientation Programs office the opportunity for as much outreach to parents and students as they had hoped, Romero said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, she believes the program was still a great success this summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Considering we didn’t advertise a lot, we got a pretty good turnout,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, orientation staffers like Parent Liaison Melissa Medina were able to reach out to Spanish-speaking parents on the first day of orientation sessions to let them know of the new program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of those parents actually didn’t know there was a Spanish parent orientation program and would come hoping they would just be able to understand something off of the English one,” Medina said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They were so relieved when we approached them and let them know.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medina, a fourth-year sociology and comparative literature double major, enjoyed working directly with the Spanish-speaking parents for most of the two-day sessions, as she could personally relate to their questions and concerns for their new students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a [first-generation student] from immigrant parents, I was able to give them my experiences of what it’s like being a student in the university,” she said. “I think that really helped them feel more comfortable with their students coming.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the goals of parent orientation is to encourage students and parents to create an open line of communication about academics, Medina said. Giving Spanish-speaking parents this same opportunity is equally as important, she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would give parents genuine stories of things I wish I would’ve been able to speak more to my parents about,” Medina said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The transition to college can be especially hard for first-generation students and their parents if they have no experience with universities, Medina emphasized. She said something as simple as giving Spanish-speaking parents a translated list of campus resources helps them feel more comfortable about the university their children are attending.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What a lot of us don’t realize is the university is such a foreign space for people who haven’t experienced it, and it can seem very intimidating… I know now that if these parents have information, they’re able to support their students and be here for them, provide them with resources and answers and let them know they belong here.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The importance of the program is personal for Romero as well, who, as a first-generation alumna of UCSB, has a background similar to those of the students she helps with the Spanish parent orientations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I came to this school, and I was also [first-generation],” she said. “And I know that if my mom had known some of the information that we have provided to our parents now, my experience here would have been 100% different because I would have had the proper support.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Romero said this program will allow Spanish-speaking parents to support their students in ways that other parents have already had the opportunity to; parents now have knowledge of campus resources to be able to answer questions that students might have regarding academics because they had the opportunity to communicate with department representatives directly at orientation, according to Romero.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For me, it’s a major deal they get the same information the other parents are getting so that they’re as well informed,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medina said she and her co-workers also received a lot of support from staff of the English-speaking program, who along with other UCSB staff were excited to see the Spanish events taking place and “would always hang around or peep into the presentation[s].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the translated material established and ready to go for future summers, the program aims to expand advertising efforts and add more department presentations to its schedule and possibly even work with the other UC campuses and their orientation programs, according to Romero. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Anytime I see a parent, I envision my mom and the happiness she would get to not only be given information, but to be seen as a normal human being, not just some foreign person,” Romero said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They are present, they also need help and they are also parents trying to support their child.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students in the Freshman Summer Start Program (FSSP) ⁠— a program that allows first-year UCSB students the chance to move in early and take one session of summer classes with the aim of easing them into UCSB ⁠— have historically lived in San Nicolas Hall, and in recent years, have stayed in that hall for their entire first year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this year, 100 slots in San Miguel Hall, San Nicholas’ neighbor, will be open to FSSP students who are interested in moving into another residence hall during the school year. Those 100 students will live in San Miguel during the summer and move into one of the other six residence halls ⁠— Anacapa, Santa Rosa, Manzanita Village, Santa Catalina, San Rafael or Santa Cruz ⁠—  once Fall Quarter 2019 begins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This change, said William Jankowski, associate director of UCSB’s Residential &amp; Community Living, was made so that students who wanted to live in other residence halls would still be able to participate in FSSP.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jankowski explained that every year, his department receives requests from FSSP students to live in residence halls other than San Nicholas for the academic year, particularly from students wanting to room with individuals who are not in FSSP and who are living in other residence halls. Non-FSSP students typically move into different residence halls the week before Fall Quarter 2019 begins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the past, students have had to choose [between FSSP and their friends],” Jankowski said.  “We’re excited this year that we can allow students to move into a different residence hall after FSSP, and opening up FSSP to San Miguel allows us to do this.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While students in FSSP are typically known for remaining together in San Nicolas for the entire year, this change is not unprecedented, according to Gallucci. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the program first began in 2002 with 210 students, most students moved out of San Nicolas for the following fall quarter. The </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ultimate goal was to fill both San Nicolas and San Miguel with 800 to 1000 students for the summer, who would then move to different residence halls in the fall, he explained. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Gallucci said that “around six or seven years ago,” Housing &amp; Residential Services changed the program to keep students together in San Nicolas for the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They wanted to try a different system, thinking that perhaps living together for a whole year would consolidate those friendships,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the program has grown over the past 17 years, with a projected total of 540 students this year </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">⁠— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">number on par with last year’s cohort of 540, which was about 10% of the class of 2022 ⁠— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the UCSB Summer Sessions office and Housing &amp; Residential Services have worked together closely to accommodate the program’s growing popularity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s slow going, because it’s hard to convince all the students that this is such a good program, because a lot of students think it’s academic boot camp,” Gallucci said. “They don’t realize how fun it can be as well. Our students have the highest GPA of any group on campus, 3.57 this past summer … they graduate at triple, sometimes quadruple, the rate of non-FSSP cohorts.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gallucci calls this year’s expansion to San Miguel a “test year.” Both Gallucci and UCSB’s Housing &amp; Residential Services hope that more FSSP students will be able to live in San Miguel as the program continues to grow in the coming years. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
