So strong, in fact, that the Gauchos have now won four games in a row thanks in large part to defensive performance, with the latest win a 64-60 road victory over Cal State Bakersfield on Tuesday night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Roadrunners shot just 42.3% against the Gaucho defense and turned the ball over 11 times. Bakersfield became the third UCSB opponent in a row to shoot under 50% and shot just 25% from beyond the 3-point line, the worst mark of any Gaucho opponent this year.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only one Roadrunner scored in double digits and the Gauchos held redshirt junior forward Taze Moore, Bakersfield’s leading scorer this season, to a season-worst 3 points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The defensive success enabled UCSB to overcome a 38.5% shooting night and 11 turnovers of its own. The Gauchos were especially cold in the second half, when the team went 8-25 from the field, but still managed to win the half 31-29.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB took a 33-31 lead into halftime and never trailed in the second half, but also never led comfortably. The Gauchos’ biggest lead was a 56-50 advantage with a little over four minutes left; the Roadrunners trimmed this lead down to 56-54 less than a minute later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two free throws from sophomore forward Amadou Sow pushed the lead to 59-54 at the 2:38 mark and seemed to put the Gauchos in a position to put the game away. UCSB got stuck at 0:59, however, and the Roadrunners clawed their way to within one with 30 seconds to go on a layup from junior guard Czar Perry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perry was almost the Roadrunners’ entire offense in crunch time, with eight of the team’s final 10 points. The junior had a game-high 23 points on 8-10 shooting, making him the only player the Gauchos just couldn’t stop.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior guard JaQuori McLaughlin responded to Perry’s layup by going 1-2 from the free throw line, which gave Bakersfield the chance to tie the game with another two-pointer. The Gauchos finally managed to stop Perry, however, forcing the junior into an offensive foul with two seconds left that effectively sealed the game for UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Redshirt transfer forward Matt Freeman had one of his best games offensively as a Gaucho with a season-high 19 points and four three-pointers. Freeman is now shooting 50% on three-pointers this season, the best mark on the team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freeman also knocked down all four of his free throw attempts in the last 10 seconds of Tuesday’s game, which was instrumental in closing the Roadrunners out. Freeman went 7-8 from the line overall in the game, and his 87.5 percentage is also best on the team this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos head back out on the road for their next game, although a little further afield. UCSB will travel to Texas to take on UT Arlington on Saturday for a 12 p.m. PST matchup.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arlington has had a remarkably uneven season so far in 2019, at 4-5. The Mavericks won their first two games, lost their next three and have alternated wins and losses losses in the four games since.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two of Arlington’s losses have come against ranked teams. The Mavericks got run out of the gym by then-No. 14 Oregon 77-47 in the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament, but followed that rout up with a heartbreaking 72-66 loss to then-No. 8 Gonzaga.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s unclear which Mavericks team will show up on Saturday, but Arlington will for sure try to win with their defense. The Mavericks have held six of their nine opponents under 70 points and opposing teams are shooting just 39.8% from the field.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arlington is nabbing 5.1 steals per game this year, with redshirt sophomore guard David Azore and senior guard Brian Warren leading the way with around one steal per game apiece. Azore and Warren have also been leading the Mavericks offense: Azore is averaging a team-best 12.6 points per game to go with 4.3 rebounds per game while Warren is scoring 11.6 points per game and handing out a team-high 4 assists per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Six-foot-nine senior forward Jabari Narcis has pulled down 7 rebounds a game so far this season, and his 16 points were an integral part of Arlington’s effort against Gonzaga. Sow stands the same height and gives up just five pounds to Narcis, which should make for an interesting matchup on Saturday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arlington is not a special team offensively, which should give the Gaucho defense a chance to come up big again. With four wins and three strong defensive performances in a row, UCSB has the confidence and momentum to take the victory.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Even Al Horford — a second-tier free agent — turned down a massive four-year offer from the Kings, opting to take less money and join a proven contender with the 76ers.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given these limitations, it’s no real surprise that the Kings received little to no media attention during the offseason; after all, the NBA is a superstar-driven league, and the Kings were (predictably) unable to grab one this offseason. But under the radar, the Kings may have had one of the smartest free agencies in recent memory, setting the team up for success in the coming years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of overpaying for a second-tier superstar, the Kings bet that their current core of De’Aaron Fox, Marvin Bagley III and Buddy Hield will take another step forward this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While his jump shot is still inconsistent, Fox showed off the tantalizing skill set last year that made him the No. 5 pick two years ago. Fox averaged 17.3 points per game and 7.3 assists per game but — perhaps most importantly — shot an impressive 37% from behind the arc. If teams start to respect Fox’s jump shot, he can utilize his athleticism to get to the hoop at will.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Hield, meanwhile, did his best Steph Curry impression last year, leading the team with 20.7 points per game while shooting 42% from three. One of the best pure shooters in the NBA, Hield should again provide excellent floor spacing for the Kings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite being the most raw of the three, Bagley showcased his versatility and athleticism last year while only playing 25 minutes per game in his rookie season. Even without an effective jump shot, Bagley averaged almost 15 points per game — thanks in large part to his willingness to run the floor with Fox.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is still a superstar league, last years’ Raptors proved the importance of depth in making a postseason run. With the skill sets of these three in mind, the Kings made a myriad of shrewd signings to provide the team with the talent and depth necessary to compete in a loaded western conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For starters, the Kings locked up Harrison Barnes to a four-year, $85 million contract. Considering the five-year, $180 million contract Tobias Harris signed with the 76ers, this deal feels like an incredible value. Somehow, Barnes is still only 27, and in his 28 games with the Kings last year, he shot the three at almost a 41% clip. With his athleticism and size, Barnes can guard multiple positions, making him a valuable defensive asset. Most importantly, the contract is front-loaded, meaning that the Kings will have the necessary cap space to resign their big three when they hit free agency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside of Barnes, all of the Kings’ free agency moves revolved around creating a solid bench unit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dewayne Dedmon is a stretch five who averaged almost 11 points for the Hawks last year, displaying a natural shooting touch that should create space for the Kings’ athletic guards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trevor Ariza is a veteran who has proven his worth time and time again, and while he struggled last year with both the Suns and the Wizards, he should be more engaged on a much more competitive team. Only two years ago, Ariza proved his worth on the Rockets, and his size and acumen make him an above-average defender, as well as a solid veteran to mentor the younger players on the roster.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, while the signing may not be attractive, Cory Joseph will provide the Kings with a steady hand to run the second unit when Fox needs a breather. Joseph will never put up gaudy numbers, but his 3.9:1 assist-to-turnover ratio from last year shows his reliability and willingness to find open teammates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The caveat for these moves, of course, is the abundance of talent in the western conference. Even with their newfound depth, the Kings will have to battle just to make the playoffs in one of the deepest conferences in recent memory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, the Kings made all the necessary moves to compete as a small market team.

Defeating Missouri Saturday evening was the one bright spot in the Gauchos’ weekend, eking out a 6-5 victory before concluding the tournament on Sunday with losses to Washington and Arizona State by scores of 10-2 and 8-0 respectively.</p>\n<p>A beautiful afternoon in Palm Springs was the backdrop for the toughest loss of the weekend for the Gauchos, a game in which they lead or shared the lead until the bottom of the sixth inning. Veronika Gulvin started and went the full six innings for UCSB, a decent effort for the sophomore who surrendered four earned runs and finished with a hefty WHIP of 2.00.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Oklahoma Head Coach Kenny Gajewski took out his sophomore starting pitcher Barbie Biggerstaff midway through the first frame, replacing her with junior Whitney Whitehorn, who would go on to toss four-and-a-third scoreless innings.</p>\n<p>After a pair of walks in the top of the fourth, the Gauchos were able to break a 2-2 tie during an odd sequence of events that included freshman infielder Kayla Krantz striking out, freshman catcher Kaitlin Barry getting thrown out at second base and Genesis Ramirez, another freshman infielder, still coming in to score from third.</p>\n<p>Two runs on a trio of Cowboy singles was the nail in the coffin for UCSB. However, as freshman Logan Simunek — who relieved Whitehorn in the sixth inning — forced a ground out, pop out and strike out to end what would be the Gauchos’ closest loss of the weekend.</p>\n<p>Freshman Felisha Noriega took the mound to face the Volunteers Thursday night, and though she was able to accomplish the second complete game by a Gaucho pitcher on the day, her eight runs allowed (six earned) — especially the final five, which all came in the fourth inning or later — proved to be all Tennessee needed to pull out an 8-3 victory.</p>\n<p>Freshman infielder Alyssa Diaz was the star of the game for the Gauchos, going 2-3 with all three of UCSB’s RBI, including a first-inning, two-run blast over the left field wall. Tennessee’s junior shortstop Meghan Gregg was there to outdo her, though, batting 2-4 with a home run, double and four RBI on the evening.</p>\n<p>Tennessee sophomore Matty Moss improved her record to 6-0 on the season (half of the Volunteers’ wins after Thursday’s contest), throwing all seven innings, striking out 10 batters and allowing only five hits and no walks.</p>\n<p>UCSB played another tough one against Purdue Friday, in which a neck-and-neck game was blown open in the top of the fifth with a flurry of Boilermaker scores. The four-run outbreak, centered on a bases-loaded double by junior catcher Kaylah Hampton, all but guaranteed the Gauchos’ third loss to start the weekend.</p>\n<p>The Boilermakers’ inferior record (this victory was only their second of the season), made this loss particularly painful for the Gauchos, especially since their bats were just beginning to come to life.</p>\n<p>Sophomore infielder Sierra Altmeyer rocked a second-inning solo home run, while Diaz was able to accumulate a double and an RBI for the second-straight game. Junior right fielder Jessica Johnston also grabbed a double of her own, and redshirt freshman Whitney Pemberton hit home a baserunner for only the fourth time this season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara finally got a positive result Saturday night, earning victory in a miraculous, comeback fashion. Down three entering the seventh and final inning, two of the first three Gaucho batters were retired on infield groundouts, but senior outfielder Stacy Cavazos was able to make her way on base after being hit by a pitch.</p>\n<p>With two outs on the scoreboard, the magic began. Jessica Johnston singled, advancing Cavazos to third, and after a ball hit to left field by Diaz, both went on to score on an error by sophomore Raime Cohen, who’d just subbed in to begin the inning.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer came to the plate with the Gauchos down two and Diaz on second base. With the game on the line, she crushed a pitch from sophomore Danielle Baumgartner into the left-field bleachers, finally assuring the Gauchos their first victory of the weekend. The two-run shot was Altmeyer’s second of the day and third in the past two games, though surprisingly those are her only three of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB lost in five innings in both of its Sunday matchups, falling 10-2 to the Washington Huskies and 8-0 to the Arizona State Sun Devils.</p>\n<p>Noriega couldn’t make it through the first inning of the Washington game, forcing the Gauchos to look past Noriega and Gulvin to freshman Lilliana Rodriguez and junior Lena Mayer, UCSB’s two lightly used pitchers. The duo surrendered nine runs (eight earned) in just three and a third innings.</p>\n<p>Gulvin was back to start the Arizona State game, but after allowing a two-run home run and hitting a batter in the second frame, the ball was again handed to Noriega, who went on to let in five more runs. She finished the next three innings, but the Gauchos’ complete inability to generate any offense sealed their fate and concluded a disappointing weekend for UCSB.</p>\n<p>While there have been glimpses of power hitting, consistent play and strong pitching for the Gauchos, this team has a long way to go if they are to climb back to the .500 mark and make 2017 a winning season. The team cannot continue to allow opponents such drastic, early leads, and the lineup must start generating more extra-base hits.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos hope March has clearer skies in store, and will begin their climb back to success against Utah Valley, Iowa State, Nevada, Southern Utah and Nebraska Omaha next weekend at the St. George Red Desert Classic.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76029\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-nab-just-one-win-at-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76029\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-nab-just-one-win-at-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-nab-just-one-win-at-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-nab-just-one-win-at-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-nab-just-one-win-at-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/","id":1185,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[1184,1183,1182],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos to Participate in Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-23-at-2.03.01-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-23-at-2.03.01-PM.png?resize=980%2C583&ssl=1","description":"UCSB will endure a challenging set of games this weekend as three of its five opponents are nationally ranked in the Top 25 of the NCAA rankings.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Another busy weekend is fast approaching for the UCSB softball squad as the team travels to Cathedral City, Calif., for the Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic.

She, too, has six RBIs, combined with four runs scored and a team pacing five doubles.</p>\n<p>The Cowboys boast two pitchers with winning records, senior Brandi Needham and first-year Logan Simunek. Needham has thrown two complete games, both shutouts, and holds a 1.66 ERA to go with a 3-1 win-loss record. She’s up to 14 strikeouts in 25 and a third innings pitched so far, more than doubling her earned run total of six over that span.</p>\n<p>The younger Simunek has appeared in seven of the 10 Oklahoma State games this season, and though her 3.42 ERA and 2-1 record don’t quite live up to the potency of her ace partner, the first-year has certainly held down the fort during her 14 innings of work.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, neither pitcher has allowed opponents to hit over .273 so far in 2017, so the Gauchos will need to reverse that trend as OSU will likely be one of their easier opponents at the tournament.</p>\n<p>Tennessee, the Gauchos’ next opponent in Thursday’s doubleheader, will enter Cathedral City undefeated. Coming off two straight shellackings in which they put up 14 runs on Oregon State and nine runs on New Mexico State, all while allowing no runs of their own, the Volunteers will be thirsty for blood and looking to improve their national rank against what appears to be an inferior UCSB opponent.</p>\n<p>The Volunteers boast several players with the potential to hit for power, most notably thus far being junior infielder Meghan Gregg and sophomore catcher and infielder Abby Lockman.</p>\n<p>Gregg leads the team with 18 RBIs, though Lockman is close on her tail with 13 of her own. They’re slugging an earth-shattering .964 and .842 respectively, the highest for players on the team who’ve participated in each of the Vols’ 10 games.</p>\n<p>On top of that, Gregg and Lockman are part of a three way tie for the team lead in home runs at two apiece, though they are just two of seven players to send one over the fence so far this season, emphasizing the penchant for offense on this Tennessee team.</p>\n<p>The Vols also rely on two workhorses within their pitching staff in sophomore Matty Moss and freshman Caylan Arnold. The two are responsible for nine of the team’s 10 wins, 49 of the team’s 57 innings and 53 of its 58 strikeouts. No one has been able to crack these two so far, though the Gauchos will take their shot Thursday.</p>\n<p>Purdue is UCSB’s only opponent on Friday, and their easiest one of the weekend. With only a 1-8 record, Purdue has lost four-straight games, including the final two only lasting five innings before ending due to the mercy rule.</p>\n<p>No one has hit a home run yet for the Boilermakers, and junior outfielder Maya Hughes, senior infielder Kristen Hoppman and sophomore utility player Mallory Baker are the only three batters approaching good seasons. Each holds a batting average over .260 — over .345 in the case of Hughes and Hoppman — and an on-base percentage over .345.</p>\n<p>Maddie Damon and Katie Johnson, a sophomore and senior respectively, have thrown the most innings on the team, just over 20 each, though Damon’s 1-1 record and 2.16 ERA is much more enticing compared to Johnson’s 0-5 mark and 9.33 ERA.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ second nationally ranked opponent of the weekend will be the Missouri Tigers.</p>\n<p>This matchup will be the first between the two programs and will feature freshman shortstop Braxton Burnside. She will try and extend her two-game streak with a home run, and improve her already stellar average of .318.</p>\n<p>Burnside will be joined by fellow first year, outfielder Cayla Kessinger, who after a rough start to the season, has torn it up in her last two games, collecting four hits in six at-bats, three runs, a homer and a double.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face two West Coast opponents on the final day of the tournament, starting Sunday against Washington and finishing it with Arizona State.</p>\n<p>Those who made the final decision in the scheduling of games certainly put the Gauchos’ greatest challenge at the end of the weekend.</p>\n<p>Washington has only one blemish on their roster, a 4-2 loss to BYU (now ranked No. 23), and has won its last six games, most recently an 8-0 shutout of the CSUN Matadors.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Taran Alvelo got the win in the contest, driving her record to 5-0, and junior Casey Stengel was able to keep her power streak alive, blasting one over the fence for the second game in a row.</p>\n<p>ASU is led by senior shortstop Chelsea Gonzales, the power hitting machine who’s slashed .538/.559/.885 in 10 games this season. Over that span, the Sun Devils have held a 9-1 record, due directly to the 14 hits, four doubles, one triple, one home run, 10 RBI and 23 total bases achieved by Gonzales.</p>\n<p>She’s propped up by a swell pitching staff, where each of the four dealers have at least two wins and an ERA no higher than 2.10. Junior Breanna Macha has thrown the most innings with 26, though first-year Giselle “G” Juarez and junior Dale Ryndak are the team’s strikeout queens with over 20 apiece.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are still led by senior outfielder Kristen Clark in the lineup, holding a .519 average and .563 OBP, to go with 14 hits, two doubles and four RBI (Clark was finally able to draw a couple walks last weekend which had been a problem for her early in the season).</p>\n<p>Sierra Altmeyer, the sophomore infielder for the Gauchos, is third on the team with 12 total bases and is slashing a solid .333/.448/.500 in 2017, giving the Gauchos a glimmer of hope looking forward on offense.</p>\n<p>UCSB will still rely heavily on sophomore Veronika Gulvin and first-year Felisha Noriega, as both pitchers have crossed the 20-inning threshold on the season. Gulvin has her ERA down to 4.20, but Noriega’s 9.48 mark, combined with the atrocious ERA of the two pitchers behind them, is certainly cause for concern if the Gauchos’ two aces can’t handle the entire load this weekend.</p>\n<p>The action all begins Thursday at noon against Oklahoma State, and rounds out the evening of Sunday, Feb. 26, with Arizona State at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of February 23rd, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75916\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-to-participate-in-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75916\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-to-participate-in-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-to-participate-in-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-to-participate-in-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/gauchos-to-participate-in-mary-nutter-collegiate-classic/","id":1186,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[1185,1184,1183],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
