For laboratories or equipment that require continued maintenance or activity, the memo asks researchers to “spell out why and what continued tasks are necessary and identify a minimum number of essential personnel who will be responsible for this critical maintenance.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incandela said funding for researchers’ pay was a concern early on, but that the federal</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> agencies, which provide most of the funding for researchers, would continue to fund research now conducted at home. </span><a href=\"https://www.research.ucsb.edu/covid-19-guidance-proposals-and-awards\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New information</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding employee wages is being made available to researchers as well, Incandela said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mahdi Abu-Omar, a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry whose research focuses on renewable energy, said that despite the shutdown, there’s still a lot of work to be done.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re experimentalists, but there’s work that we do offline in terms of writing papers and preparing and planning and processing data,” Abu-Omar said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Of course not being able to do experiments is holding us back a little bit. But [writing and preparing data] for the next several weeks is manageable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the coronavirus outbreak, Abu-Omar had been anticipating the arrival of a scientist and a professor from overseas this summer, but after UCSB’s research shutdown, “both of these jobs are postponed until we figure out what’s going on,” Abu-Omar said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the shuttering of research on campus, there are still alternatives for student researchers, such as proposing ideas for future projects, Incandela said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students can read and learn a lot about how the research they planned to do is connected to previous results. This is just one example, and I am sure there are many other possibilities like running simulations or brain-storming about something completely new,” Incandela explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This may be an unprecedented period of thought and reflection that brings many new ideas to campus for future research.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

P/NP policies will help students through the tumultuous changes brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new policy, which was detailed in an email sent to students on Wednesday, was created to mitigate the impact that the coronavirus could have on academic performance and reduce anxiety among students due to the various devastating impacts of the virus, according to Henning Bohn, divisional chair of UCSB’s Academic Senate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A pass/no pass (P/NP) grade does not impact a student’s GPA, and if a department opts in to the grading change by April 17, students can take certain courses as P/NP that previously they could take only for letter grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students normally have to decide to have their classes graded P/NP by week seven but can now make the switch anytime up until June 5, the last day of spring quarter instruction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students on academic probation cannot take classes P/NP, and veterans using the GI bill may have to repay money to Veteran’s Affairs if they receive an NP grade, the email continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview, Bohn expressed concern that students could overlook possible disadvantages that sometimes come with the P/NP grading option. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have very, very mixed feelings. Pass/no pass is something that students should only take when it is to their advantage,” Bohn said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Students] should probably talk to an academic advisor first to make sure that it’s a wise choice,” he added, citing the possible repercussions students could face when applying to graduate schools.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Law schools will recalculate NP grades to an “F” letter grade, according to the email, and many graduate schools could hold unfavorable views on P/NP marks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate schools have a variety of opinions and standards regarding P/NP grades, according to Claudio Campagnari, chair of UCSB’s Department of Physics.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that anybody looking at graduate applications would understand that spring 2020 is a weird time, but who knows?” Campagnari said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that if it were up to him, he would have preferred a mandatory P/NP system for every class, which many schools, like </span><a

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Stanford</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, have adopted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campagnari is optimistic that the new P/NP policies will help students through the tumultuous changes brought on by the coronavirus pandemic but acknowledges that the quarter will likely continue to see more obstacles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s really going to be a weird quarter,” Campagnari said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alli Adam, internal vice president of Associated Students, said she hopes that the new P/NP policy will work to alleviate some of the academic burden placed on students, especially those with tenuous access to the internet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students have been put in unfair situations and I would hate to see it negatively affect anybody’s GPA because they don’t have the proper resources now that remote classes are happening,” Adam said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

gardeners, dining hall workers, faculty, administrators and doctors and nurses at UC medical centers — will be protected at all 10 UC campuses, five medical centers and the Office of the President. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano clarified in the </span><a

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that this does not mean that there will not be cutbacks on hours or layoffs for staff as part of “typical student and career employee summer staffing and clinical workforce adjustments.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement also said that the UC will begin discussions with employee groups to “consider the conditions under which we may be able to extend this promise of job protection beyond June 30th, should that be necessary.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an entirely remote spring quarter and a statewide stay-at-home order, many employees working in on-campus services are unable to work, while other university employees deemed as working in essential services, such as medical workers, have continued working under critical conditions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement said that the UC will work with unions to “redeploy workers to areas of need to keep as many employees working as possible.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Providing pay and health and welfare benefits during this period will allow employees to more effectively care for themselves and their families,” the statement read. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i
