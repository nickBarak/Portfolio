Both Shofet and Shahaf are working together to address food insecurity, specifically for those who only eat halal and kosher food, by providing them with food that fits their dietary needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Halal and Kosher Program creates weekly grocery bags for low income students who follow Halal and Kosher dietary restrictions,” Shahaf said in an email. “Every week the bags have a breakfast option, a set of instant lunches, potential snacks, and a dinner option.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Shahaf, the program is currently funded through the UCSB Food Security &amp; Basic Needs Taskforce; it also partners with the Isla Vista Food Cooperative (I.V. Co-op), which provides the food at discount prices and assists with transportation. Shahaf and the I.V. Co-op communicate through weekly emails and occasional meetings to plan what food items will be in the bags for that week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know how we would be running this program without the Isla Vista Food Cooperative’s charitable nature and the discounted pricing they offer us,” Shahaf stated. “Their amazing team, as well as the food bank employees, help me load all the food into a van headed to the food bank, where we assemble and place the bags.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shahaf explained that the Associated Students Food Bank also plays an integral role in the program running smoothly, as its employees assist in picking up bulk orders, assemble bags and help sign in Halal and Kosher Program participants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shahaf said she constantly communicates with leading members of campus organizations such as the I.V. Co-op and the UCSB Sustainability to ensure everything is running smoothly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I also check in and receive feedback from other leaders on campus like the Middle Eastern Resource Center, and the Muslim Student Association for new ideas and to see how we can improve or better serve our joint Muslim and Jewish Community,” Shahaf added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But to Shahaf, the importance of the program extends beyond its day-to-day operations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Keeping Kosher is how I keep my ancestors and my cultural past close to my heart, and it is one of the only aspects of Judaism in my daily life,” she explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I imagine it is similar for many Muslim students who keep Halal, as they are reminded of Islamic persecution around the world. I want to make it possible for every Jewish and Muslim student to keep their religious dietary restrictions, and to feel seen and supported by this campus.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the March 5, 2020 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93288\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/on-campus-halal-kosher-food-program-helps-students-with-dietary-restrictions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93288\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/on-campus-halal-kosher-food-program-helps-students-with-dietary-restrictions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/on-campus-halal-kosher-food-program-helps-students-with-dietary-restrictions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/on-campus-halal-kosher-food-program-helps-students-with-dietary-restrictions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/on-campus-halal-kosher-food-program-helps-students-with-dietary-restrictions/","id":1867,"author":{"id":276,"name":"Daniel Seo"},"related":[1866,1865,1864],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":276,"name":"Daniel Seo","biography":"Not available","articles":[1844,1867,3467],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"University, Organizations Discuss Voter Registration Efforts as California Primary Approaches","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/voter-reg-effort-2-siceng-wang-daily-nexus.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/voter-reg-effort-2-siceng-wang-daily-nexus.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In I.V., registration numbers have peaked at 13,000 registered voters during presidential election years.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara boasts one of the highest rates of student voter registration in the country — at 40.2% in 2018.

As of the 2010 census, more than 23,000 people live in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the deadline has passed to register for the March primary, the work is hardly over for Marsano, with the November 2020 election right around the corner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I anticipate that this upcoming presidential election will be busy. Of course, we will only have three and a half weeks to register students because they come back the last week of September and the deadline to register next year is October 19 and elections are November 3,” Marsano said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She attributed UCSB’s high voter registration percentage to a greater push for in-person registration, opposed to online registration as most other universities do.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB’s notorious about preferring face-to-face voter registration rather than online,” Marsano explained. “You would get a card and if you didn’t do something with that card and mail it back, you would not be really registered. So the follow-up was more complicated.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Education is another important factor in the voting process that many of the organizations take on in addition to registration, according to Christian Ornelas, the Executive Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Ornelas noted that the EVPLA office attempted to clear misinformation about voting after Rock the Vote SB’s national organization declared the local chapter illegitimate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After their first big efforts for registry during welcome week at campus dorms, Natalie Bastawros, vice president of Campus Democrats, said the VRVC went to great lengths to make sure everyone had the opportunity to register to vote in Santa Barbara County.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The goal of the club is to try to make it easier for people to register,” Bastawros said about the VRVC. She explained that if an individual registers online within Santa Barbara County, and they miss a box or two, the county sends you back an additional form in the mail for you to fill out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus Democrats table Monday through Friday all of winter quarter for voter registration, according to Bastawros, and have also increased door-to-door canvassing in I.V. and at university housing. An app called PDI allows Campus Democrats to access public voter registration information, allows canvassers to target locations with low registration, according to Bastawros.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Organizations pushing for voter registration often face resistance from students who are already registered, but in a different county. A big part of tabling is educating students how local policies can have significant impact,” Bastawros said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It might not seem like that on the national level, but for the local elections here as students live, whether you live on campus or in I.V., it’s really, really important to register here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the Feb. 18 voter registration deadline, Campus Democrats tabled at ten different locations on campus up until the 6 p.m. deadline. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. is a “swing district” that determines the 3rd District County Supervisor vote, Bastawros said. While the other districts are fairly unwavering, the 3rd District, which encompasses I.V. and parts of northern and central Santa Barbara County, is often the deciding vote between the more rural 4th and 5th districts and the smaller but more populated 1st and 2nd districts that include Santa Barbara and Carpinteria.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

for implementation. </span><em>Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, Ciara Thrower, a third-year environmental studies major, is authoring a proposal to present to the UCSB Academic Senate that would dissolve the requirement and merge it into the World Cultures requirement, after she gained the unanimous support of the Associated Students (A.S.) Senate last week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thrower said that the European Traditions requirement has a “bad connotation” and has bothered her since her freshman year, as she believes many classes outside the requirement are often Eurocentric.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been looking into [the European Traditions requirement] more and a lot of schools across the country are getting rid of their requirement,” Thrower said in an interview with the Nexus. “And then we’re the only UC that has a requirement like that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with having the general A-E requirements, UCSB also has two requirements in the context of European history under Special Subject Area requirements: the European Traditions requirement and the World Cultures requirement, which includes classes with a focus on “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one or more culture outside of the European tradition.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The European Traditions requirement, defined as any class pertaining to “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">early and/or modern European cultures and their significance in world affairs” has been in place since the 80s, according to Harold Marcuse, a German history professor in the history department at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Marcuse, the requirement was born out of the World Wars and got a boost by the subsequent Cold War, which was enough to solidify the requirement’s place at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just very Eurocentric,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marcuse, who is assisting Thrower in forming the Academic Senate proposal, had pushed to remove the requirement in 2002. According to Marcuse, the current Area E requirement, known as Culture and Thought, was initially split into two sections —  E1 and E2 — one of which was the Western Civilizations requirement, which he called “outdated.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the recommendations that we had was to completely get rid of that requirement, but there was a fair amount of resistance from a few departments,” Marcuse said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now courses tend to really fill up no matter what. But back then some departments really lived from student enrollments in the courses they offered that fulfilled that area requirement.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to maintain enrollment in those classes, Marcuse said that the Western Civilizations requirement was converted into an add-on requirement, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">now known as the European Traditions requirement, while redefining and updating the various other general education categories and requirements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were also suggestions for an LGBTQ+ and interdisciplinary studies requirements, but both of them failed out of departments’ desire to keep the general education requirements as is, Marcuse added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to change the requirement, Marcuse said there are various paths a proposal would have to take before being considered for implementation. After going through multiple committees — such as the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Committee on Courses and General Education, the Academic Senate and the faculty executive committee — the proposal would have to be vetted by the registrar to determine if it can be implemented, according to Marcuse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After receiving feedback from faculty and administration, the proposal would go into a vote in the faculty legislature, a body that encompasses tenured faculty and representatives from the Academic Senate and has the final say on it, according to Marcuse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Thrower, however, the first step was garnering support from student organizations on campus, including a resolution through the A.S. Senate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution, titled “A Resolution To Abandon the European Traditions Requirement,” was authored by Off-Campus Senators Kimia Hadidi and Adalis Rojas and passed at the Feb. 19 Senate meeting. However, the resolution supports abandoning the requirement, which is separate from Thrower’s proposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Hadidi, a bulk of high school history already revolves around Europe — a redundancy with the European Traditions requirement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we do want to learn about other cultures, we should have that option to do it,” she said, “as opposed to just having a European Traditions where it’s one class, [and] in a World Cultures where it’s another, why not combine the two?” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After gaining the Senate’s approval, Thrower said her next step is to present her proposal to the UCSB Academic Senate on March 12 and focus on other universities across the country who have abandoned their versions of the requirements in favor of a more holistic education.</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lafayette emphasized the importance of nonviolent resistance, having worked closely with Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. </span><em>Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Feb. 20, Lafayette, a prominent figure in the civil rights movement, came to UC Santa Barbara to talk to the student body about how to live as conscious citizens in a world shaped by the actions of social activists.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The discussion, titled “An Evening with Dr. Bernard Lafayette Jr.: Nonviolence in a Time of Civil Unrest,” was organized by the Associated Students Program Board and marked Lafayette’s first visit to the university.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most associated with the Freedom Riders and later the Selma Voting Rights movement, Lafayette emphasized the importance of nonviolent resistance, having worked closely with Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Diane Nash and James Bevel in the American Civil Rights Movement.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1967, King even offered Lafayette a position as the program director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the Nexus before the lecture, Lafayette went into detail regarding his experiences as a political organizer and a protester, working with the Nashville Student Movement, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the SCLC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also lamented traits that he said he has seen in some present-day social movements and activists, such as a tendency to focus on the problems themselves rather than proposed solutions, as well as an inability to look at their activism from a broader perspective.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Present-day activists] need to reexamine to see whether or not they’re taking everything into consideration. And whether or not they’re benefiting also from the laws enacted, changed and whether or not they are harmful to themselves or harmful to others as well,” Lafayette said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Public policy is very much related to what people expect and expectations from constituencies that are involved … they can’t look at it from a narrow, narrow view. Unfortunately, people sometimes make decisions [solely] based on their own ethnic identity or political affiliation,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also noted that the arrival of advanced technology, such as the internet, has allowed people who share similar values and ways of thinking to establish forums and foster vibrant communities of activists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media, for instance, changed the playing field in regards to how opinions, personal musings and even breaking news is communicated to and amongst the masses, Lafayette said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[With social media] you can communicate with large numbers of people,” he said. “We didn’t have that. We had to use little simple methods and depend so much on the public media.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building a relationship with the media, however, still remains an incredibly important thing to do, Lafayette said. He added that the media is the party that will project a social movement to the broader public.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s how we were able to accomplish the things that we accomplished, because we learned how to deal with the media. Part of the whole movement is to reach the masses of people … you need to pay special attention to maintain and sustain a movement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The media is [still] important … you have to learn how to maintain communication with the media in such a way that your movement is able to continue,” Lafayette said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Lafayette recalled his experience as one of the original Freedom Riders, civil rights activists who protested segregated buses in the South by riding interstate buses from Washington, D.C. to New Orleans in mixed-race groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Freedom Riders were arrested in Jackson, Mississippi, Lafayette said he and his companions were able to create more publicity for their movement when they were taken into police custody. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Rather than [make bail] and continue on to New Orleans, we decided to stay in jail a longer period of time. We stayed in jail to prolong the movement,” Lafayette said, adding that “as a result of this, we had [people from] about 11 different countries come to the U.S.” to express solidarity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As he began his talk, Lafayette started to discuss lineage, speaking to the crowd about his formative years growing up in the Tampa, Florida area, as well as his Afro-Caribbean and French roots. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the talk, Lafayette focused on the distinction between successful and unsuccessful social movements, asking, “What are some of the techniques and strategies that are actually applicable universally?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The easiest answer to this, according to Lafayette, is also the simplest: disciplined nonviolence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He attributed the significance of civil disobedience to its ability to invalidate unjust laws without resorting to acts of violence. In particular, Lafayette emphasized the importance of accepting the legal consequences of civil disobedience in order to lend weight to one’s argument.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What you don’t want to do is behave the same way the others behave. If you’re gonna bring about change, you have to change yourself first,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You must only accept the consequences. That was the most important lesson I learned,” Lafayette said. “You have to be willing to accept the consequences when you refuse to obey an unjust law because the law is [supposed] to determine your behavior, but you make it ineffective when you ignore it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lafayette also described the need to appeal to the popular majority in order to secure civil rights gains.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was Napoleon who said that no revolution has ever been won without the active support of the majority. Who do you think passed the Civil Rights Bill in Congress?” he asked the crowd. “There weren’t no Black elected officials to pass no bill. We were able to win them over.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the floor opened to questions, the audience honed in specifically on Lafayette’s relationship with the late King.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about his disagreements with King, Lafayette could only recall one — whether or not the Albany Movement to desegregate public spaces in Georgia was a success. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“King believed that we failed, but my position was that no, we succeeded in the Albany Movement. Martin Luther King would always get involved in movements that had larger impact and bring about some national change or national legislation,” Lafayette said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We might have resolved that if he lived.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked how he responded to the news of King’s death, Lafayette described how the tragedy reinstilled in him the drive to continue King’s work. Lafayette said he devoted his energy and attention to King’s broader long-term goal: to spread the practice of nonviolence across the globe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had to make a decision, with the news of his death … I decided to focus on the last words that King said to me: ‘We have got to internationalize and institutionalize nonviolence.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After King’s death, Lafayette returned to school to further educate himself on the law and the utility of nonviolence in social and political advocacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I went to law school at Boston University because I wanted to think like a lawyer. I didn’t want to be a lawyer, but I wanted to think like a lawyer. Then I went to Harvard University to study nonviolence and education, and I got my master’s.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After college, he would continue to work as an activist for decades, becoming a distinguished authority on nonviolent strategies for social activism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with nonviolence, Lafayette said persistence is also a key ingredient in the making of a successful social movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You know, I was beaten in Selma, Alabama, the same night that Medgar Evers who was in the NAACP, in Mississippi, was shot and killed. And they planned to do the same thing to me the same night,” Lafayette said. “Fortunately, I survived that.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The FBI reported to me that [the Ku Klux Klan] had a plan to castrate me, to throw me in the river, and all that, you know.
