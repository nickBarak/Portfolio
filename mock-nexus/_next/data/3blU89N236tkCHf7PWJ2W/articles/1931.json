CSD, pictured at a meeting during Spring Quarter, discussed the reductions at its last district meeting. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/i-v-csd-considers-turning-deltopia-into-a-sanctioned-festival/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">original $184,850 proposal</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was lowered to $159,850, as announced at last Tuesday’s Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting. The updated budget still features many of the original proposal’s designs, such as the beer garden and the music stages; however, cuts were still made to several areas to reduce the event’s overall cost, including having less fencing and fewer portable toilets, information kiosks and targeted Facebook advertisements. The updated budget also cut the number of giveaways in half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Isla-Vista-April-2020-Event-Production-Budget-Reduction-Budget-159K.pdf\">new proposal</a> further removes one of the music stages, a reduction of $7,000, that could potentially be brought back with a sponsorship — something that UC Santa Barbara’s Associated Students (A.S.) could potentially fulfill, according to I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud presented a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Isla-Vista-April-2020-Event-Production-Budget-Sheet3.pdf\">variety of options</a> to enable the board to fund the event during Tuesday’s meeting, including asking UC Santa Barbara to fund the street </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/evpla-publishes-proposal-for-lighting-expansion-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lighting project</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well as drawing money from different sources in the I.V. CSD budget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the reductions, some board members still expressed concern over the lack of official partners and sponsorships to help cover the cost of the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of last Tuesday’s meeting, no other entity has agreed to fund the festival. However, Board President Spencer Brandt named UCSB, A.S., Santa Barbara City College, the Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District, the city of Goleta and local businesses as current potential sponsors for the festival. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At the number that we have in front of us with no else at the table with us, I’m not comfortable using our revenue for it, in the full amount,” Director Ethan Bertrand said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Kristie Nguyen agreed with Bertrand’s concerns and suggested scaling down the size and cost of the event to gauge the community’s response, and afterward, determine if the festival was a success and warrants a greater investment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we find out if [the spring festival] is going to be successful, then we can start funding more money. But as of right now, we don’t know the success rate, and we won’t know until it actually happens,” Nguyen said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity has also shouldered a portion of its festival budget under Operating Expenses but stressed that the Safety and Security portion is “NOT THE PLACE TO CUT” in the budget, as stated in the proposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have been continuously telling people that the reason why we want to do this is not because we want Deltopia to be shut down. It’s because we want to draw people — a certain amount of people, not everyone, but a certain amount of people — away from the [Del Playa] area because that is where the public safety problems are,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to gather community feedback regarding the spring festival, the I.V. CSD will be having a town hall at St. George’s Youth Center tomorrow, Oct. 28, at 6 p.m. with Lucidity representatives present.

After his recent performance in the Copa América Final loss to Chile, he blamed himself for the team’s loss. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, many critics believe Messi is being too hard on himself by accepting full blame for his team’s loss.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the loss to Chile in 2016, Messi had already begun contemplating retirement from international soccer after so many futile efforts to win a championship for Argentina. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he missed that penalty kick last week in the Copa Finals, he knew then that the end of his soccer career had arrived, and the missed shot seemed to validate his decision to retire, not just for him, but for his team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Messi is living proof that even the best can make mistakes. Messi has certainly made mistakes before, yet this mistake leaves Messi reconsidering his entire future. Should this one mistake cause Messi to retire from his national team and international soccer?  He seems to think so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he will continue to play club soccer for Spanish champions FC Barcelona, he will be dearly missed on the global stage and Argentina national team, as he was an idol to many across the world.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five years later, the United States remains somewhat of a laughing stock in the footballing world, struggling to impose their style of play on games against teams that are clearly superior. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This has been the national team’s most visible struggle under Klinsmann, and something that continued in its three losses to Colombia and Argentina in the Copa América.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After exiting the Copa at the semifinals in a pretty embarrassing display against Argentina — the U.S. didn’t even get off a shot in the match, resulting in a 4-0 loss — now is as good a time as any to reconsider the future of the team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the weeks leading up to the tournament, the manager’s job was coming under question with the expectation that Klinsmann would likely be relieved of his duties should he prove unable to lead his players through a deep run at the cup.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Quite a bit of it is always results. We take time after every major competition to reflect on that competition and what led up to it. It’s not a single game, or a single result. It’s where the program is and how comfortable we feel in the direction that it’s going,” Gulati said to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ussoccer.com</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after hiring the German.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This pragmatic approach is a perfect system of reevaluation for the president of a national FA. If the head of U.S. soccer still holds these beliefs, then he needs to really contemplate whether or not Klinsmann is the man to truly evolve not only the on-field results of the national team, but the general view of the sport in a country that’s just now starting to latch onto the beautiful game as a national passion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klinsmann has surely brought more stability to the national team setup, consistently selecting the same core players since he took over as boss, including German-American recruits John Brooks, Jermaine Jones and Fabian Johnson, all players that have proven themselves as some of the most talented athletes to represent the USMNT.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consistency and stability over time, though, fade into redundancy, and Klinsmann has failed to improve results in his five-year tenure. If Gulati honestly surveys the competition at the U.S.’s last two major tournaments, a semifinal appearance in the Copa América is almost less impressive than advancing from the 2014 World Cup’s “group of death.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nonetheless, in the two years between the tournaments, there has been little to no improvement in the team’s roster. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where is Julian Green, who in one of his only chances with the national team scored a brilliant volley on Belgium’s Thibaut Courtois? Where is Juan Agudelo, who, last year against Mexico showcased technical ability on a level that is nowhere to be found in Klinsmann’s current “preferred” side?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the biggest question of all: Where in the world was young starlet Christian Pulisic at the Copa América, who was given all but a half hour on the field throughout the entire tournament?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let it be known that zero other Americans have the quality to make the first team at Borrusia Dortmund, and Pulisic is much more than a part player in Thomas Tuchel’s squad. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 17-year-old was eased into the team with substitute appearances in the Bundesliga, but over the course of the season, solidified his role as an impact sub coming in on the wing for the German league runners-up, even grabbing a couple goals in key matches during his team’s title race.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The argument that Pulisic couldn’t fit into the starting lineup for the U.S. is absurd; when a player has the pace, ability to take on defenders and talent to pick out a pass in the attacking third for one of Europe’s finest clubs, he has the quality to start every game for the USMNT.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s most shocking about how Klinsmann handled Pulisic’s first major exposure to the senior national team, though, is how he seemed to tiptoe around the subject in press conferences, as if he was afraid of Pulisic gaining too much fandom so early in his career. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">America undoubtedly has struggled with overhyping under-talented players, namely Freddy Adu, but when a young man shows the promise of becoming a truly world-class footballer, playing time never hinders growth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact that Klinsmann opted for more established players such as Gyasi Zardes, Michael Bradley and Kyle Beckerman against Argentina showed a lack of boldness when facing Messi and co. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sitting back and defending was never going to beat the top-ranked South American country, but still, Klinsmann was afraid of making a change that may yield criticism upon failure, almost like he was trying his best to save his job.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he was hired as the new manager of a long-term project like the U.S. men’s team in 2011, he promised an injection of youth, but six of the starters versus Argentina were 30 or older. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">U.S. soccer has stagnated, and Klinsmann is to blame as much as anyone. With the next World Cup in two years, now would be the perfect time for Gulati to cut his losses with the German and hire a new, more daring coach who offers a higher ceiling for the national team as it fights through qualifying for Russia.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71791\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-02/red-flags-surround-klinsmanns-tenure-with-the-usmnt/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71791\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-02/red-flags-surround-klinsmanns-tenure-with-the-usmnt/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-02/red-flags-surround-klinsmanns-tenure-with-the-usmnt/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-02/red-flags-surround-klinsmanns-tenure-with-the-usmnt/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-02/red-flags-surround-klinsmanns-tenure-with-the-usmnt/","id":1929,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1928,1927,1926],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sigma Pi Operations Suspended By National Executive Office While UCSB Investigates Sexual Assault Allegations","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-23-at-11.55.41-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-23-at-11.55.41-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In the past month, there have been three reports of sexual assault at the Sigma Pi house.
