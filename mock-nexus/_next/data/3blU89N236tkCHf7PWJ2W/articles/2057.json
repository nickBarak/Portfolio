About 92% of the building’s total space will be devoted to classrooms and lecture halls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Finance and Capital Strategies Committee is comprised of UC Regents as well as other advisory members, including Governor Gavin Newsom, UC President Janet Napolitano and chancellors from some of the UC campuses. They approved UCSB’s new building </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> along with new building projects at the Riverside, Berkeley and San Diego campuses </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on May 16 at the UC Regents meeting at UC San Francisco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These new building projects are part of <a href=\"https://www.facilities.ucsb.edu/departments/campus-planning-design/2010-long-range-development-plan-lrdp\">UC’s Long Range Development Plan (LRDP)</a>; the plan was implemented by the Regents in 2010, with the purpose of “shap[ing] how the campus will develop to the year 2025, including changes in our academic programs and the development of additional campus housing for students, faculty, and staff,” according to UCSB’s Design, Facilities, and Safety Services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, UCSB’s new Classroom Building will cost $97,133,000; 82% of funding is from state appropriations of $79,787,000, while 18% is from campus funds, which are non-state, non-tuition reserves from grants, investments and sponsored contracts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A portion of state appropriations will also come from state funding previously allocated for the Campbell Hall Replacement Building. Originally, the funding was allocated to tear down and replace Campbell Hall; however, concerns of the project’s financial feasibility, combined with immediate safety concerns, led UCSB to implement critical life-safety improvements and repairs in order to ensure safe, ongoing use of Campbell Hall, according to the proposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal states the new building will also alleviate problems of over-enrollment which have contributed to lower four-year graduation rates. UCSB’s registrar cited “lack of classrooms and inappropriately sized classrooms as the primary cause of … increasing student waitlists that tend to affect the four-year graduation rate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new Classroom Building will accommodate more than “twice the capacity and many more rooms than the previous Campbell Hall plans,” according to the proposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other alternatives to the Classroom Building discussed in the proposal include leasing off-campus space or annexing existing academic and administrative building space, but these ideas were not deemed viable by the committee because all other existing facilities on campus are already fully occupied, and “logistical problems” prevented leasing buildings in Isla Vista for classroom use.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88801\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88801\" data-attachment-id=\"88801\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/regents-approve-new-classroom-building-to-alleviate-over-enrollment/screen-shot-2019-05-29-at-3-32-34-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?fit=1200%2C772&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,772\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-29 at 3.32.34 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?fit=250%2C161&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?fit=888%2C571&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-88801 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?resize=888%2C571\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"571\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?resize=250%2C161&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?resize=768%2C494&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?resize=1024%2C659&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88801\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Proposed design for the new Classroom Building, located between the Psychology building and Davidson Library. <em>Courtesy of UC Regents</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to substantially increasing the amount of classroom space on campus, the Classroom Building will also incorporate more modern classroom designs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current classrooms are “exclusively traditional in format … lack[ing] the flexibility, amenities, and technology needed to accommodate contemporary, project-based learning,” according to the proposal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three active learning classrooms in the Classroom Building are designed for project-based teaching and group and student participation, with flexibility to arrange furniture and digital and visual technology for each class’s specific needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional discussion classrooms will include moveable furnishings and digital capability for project-based work, and lecture halls will be designed with rotating seats, allowing “turn-to-team” interaction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Classroom Building plan also requires the demolishing of Building 408, which holds the </span>McCauley Lab in EEMB (Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology) and the Passow Lab in MSI (Marine Science Institute), along with various graduate and faculty offices.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campus bike path runs through the future construction site for the Classroom Building;

The fee needed approval from 60% of voters in order to pass — or so A.S. Elections Board thought. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Elections Board Chair John Paul Renteria, Elections Board noticed a “discrepancy” between the A.S. Constitution and the Elections Code following elections night.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the AS 2018-2019 Constitution, it states that new fees put onto the ballot through a vote of senate need at least ⅔ of the votes to pass,” Renteria said in an email. “In Elections Code, it states that new fees put onto the ballot through the vote of the senate need 60%.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the Constitution is the superior law within A.S., the 64.93% of “yes” votes that SIRRC received was not enough — SIRRC needed two-thirds of the vote, according to Renteria. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SIRRC could not be reached for comment.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This discrepancy between the A.S. Constitution and the Elections Code has not always existed, however. Students voted to make the 60% to two-thirds, or 66%, change to the A.S. Constitution in 2017, according to Renteria. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time, Renteria said, the percentage change was made to the A.S. Constitution but not to Elections Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, if a new fee is put on the ballot by a vote of the A.S. Senate, two-thirds of the vote is needed for the adoption of the fee. Since the SIRRC fee was put on the ballot by a Senate vote, and not by a petition, this two-thirds requirement applies to the SIRRC fee. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the Constitution change was in 2017 and no new fees were put on the 2018 Spring Quarter Elections ballot, Elections Board did not discover this discrepancy until after the 2019 Spring Quarter elections, Renteria said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The discrepancy was brought to A.S. Senate’s attention during last week’s Senate meeting, since the 2019 Spring Quarter A.S. Elections results were on the agenda. However, Senate was unable to ratify the results, since not enough senators showed up to the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During public forum on May 8, Renteria informed A.S. Senate that the SIRRC fee did not pass.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The senators were then given the opportunity to ask clarifying questions, and by the end, a few senators said they agreed with Elections Board’s right to interpret the election results the way they did. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Rafael Cornejo said that if SIRRC had an issue with interpretation, SIRRC could file a complaint with Judicial Council. On-Campus Senator Yash Nagpal cited A.S. Legal Code, which states that Elections Board has jurisdiction over all election rules and policies and has the power to interpret the Elections Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Attorney General Zeina Safadi addressed the discrepancy during A.S. Senate’s public forum as well; however, she had differing views from Elections Board. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Parts of legal code says you need 60%, and then other parts of legal code say you need 66%, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">so, what you guys need to decide amongst yourselves is … whether or not you’re going to go with the 60% or 66%, and each part of legal code says something different about that,” Safadi said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My suggestion for you guys is to open a special election … You do have the ability to either affirm it or ratify or do whatever you want with it, regardless of what the student vote was.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Renteria indicated that only Elections Board could interpret the results and that the interpretation is not up for debate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked whether Elections Board has the final say in interpreting elections results, Safadi said in a message that “Elections Board has a say on how elections code is interpreted in relation to that fee, as does the attorney general’s office on how to interpret legal code.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ultimately, it is Senate who possesses the most power in determining the course of action following all the information presented to them (i.e. do they want to have a special election for that fee?),” Safadi added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safadi said during public forum that since new fees usually fail, there is no precedent for this exact situation. Safadi did acknowledge that the A.S. Constitution is the superior law. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Wednesday night’s meeting, A.S.

Six senators abstained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate’s approval of the results is seemingly a nod in agreement to Elections Board’s right to interpret the results of the election.  </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

The new space is 981 square feet and has two offices and a bathroom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center currently has approximately 550 square feet and is composed of one small room and an office. But this current space is not large enough to accommodate to students in need of private meeting spaces, according to Coby Dillard, veterans and military services coordinator.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dillard said an ideal “one-stop shop” resource center would have an academic advisor, a counselor and a certifying official who can double as a financial aid representative and provide any other resources that an incoming veteran student would need, all in one place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, Dillard said, when a student comes to the center, he can “help to a degree,” but at the end of the day, he often has to direct them to multiple different places. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Research says that if you have individuals who can come into a single location and get all their assistance, over the long-term, they perform better academically,” Dillard added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new location takes a step toward a “one-stop shop” with larger square footage and dedicated meeting rooms, which Dillard can use to set up office hours for various advisors to drop in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Dillard isn’t the first one who has tried to turn the center into a “one-stop shop.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2014, two student veterans presented a list of <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-04-10/veterans-fight-for-more-resources-at-ucsb/\">grievances and demands</a> for change to Chancellor Henry T. Yang. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First on the list of demands was a “space that can continuously accommodate quiet study, lounge, peer to peer tutoring, mental health and VA counseling…. These rooms will not be decentralized and will share a similar location or structure.” But Dillard described this demand as only partially fulfilled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2014, the center occupied a 10-by-10 foot space in building 477, across the courtyard from the current office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of the demands, roughly 400 members of the entire student body were military-related, which includes veterans, military dependents, reserve duty students and more. Dillard said that number has now increased to over 520. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the one-stop shop model is years in the making, the center’s high staff turnover made it difficult for any real progress to be made, according to Dillard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dillard is the fourth person since 2012 to run the program. The first two coordinators stepped down to go back to school, and the third served as an interim coordinator until Dillard was hired in July 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staff turnover is also the reason why so many of the unspoken agreements that the center has with other departments on campus are not formal policies, Dillard said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Institutionally, a lot of our policies exist, but they’re not formalized anywhere,” Dillard said. “I know all the veterans get priority registration… And then the question in here is ‘Is there a formal written policy?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of my relationships with other offices across campus are based on understandings that have worked, not necessarily formal policy.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Dillard came to UCSB, his goal for his first year was “just stabilizing the place.” From there, Dillard said he moved on to assessing which areas of the center were in need of the most attention, and how he could best go about fixing them next year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In September 2018, U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked UCSB as the number four public school in the nation for veterans and 10th nationwide </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but Dillard finds that “rankings like that don’t necessarily reflect what the student experience is because that particular ranking did not ask any questions about the student experience.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, Dillard finds that the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Military Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s survey, “Best for Vets” is a better metric as it accounts for “services and student experience.” Next year, Dillard plans to have veteran students at UCSB complete the survey so the university can be ranked on the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Military Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> survey.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dillard’s ideas for the center stem from years of experience of working with veterans, most recently in Virginia Beach, Va. Dillard said that coming to UCSB and working as a coordinator was the next progression for his career. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After doing this for seven, eight years, this is kind of the next progression for me career-wise,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The next natural step is to run a program and if you’re going to run a program, [UCSB’s program] wouldn’t be bad to start with [because it is] one that is in need of some sort of strengthening.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For his first Memorial Day at UCSB, Dillard wanted to not only honor former and current service members, but also make the holiday more visible to the school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, the Veterans and Military Services program installed a “flag garden” made up of 2,000 flags planted in the open green space between the Annex and Storke Lawn.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think everyone either appreciated it being there, or once they were told why it was there, then they appreciated it being there,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Events like this are one way for Dillard and the program to increase visibility and awareness of veteran students on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Dillard has several aspirations for the center in the next few years, the most significant one is emphasizing the importance of developing the Veterans and Military Services program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one actually has been here long enough to take it from a resource center to a program.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dillard hopes to be the one to change this.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the May 30, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
