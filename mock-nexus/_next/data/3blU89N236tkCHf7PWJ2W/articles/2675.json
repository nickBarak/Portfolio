Talks Live in New York City on Nov. 2 in Town Hall Theater to discuss the “Education Revolution.”</p>\n<p>The talk will focus on reforming education curriculums in public schools to better serve marginalized, “at-promise” students. Rios said he was motivated by his personal journey in overcoming adversities to research the education systems within public schools and their effects on marginalized students.</p>\n<p>According to Rios, the T.E.D. Talk will focus on his work in developing a curriculum for high school “push-outs” who have been victimized and criminalized by schools.</p>\n<p>“They get punished overwhelmingly, they get reported to police, they get told ‘you’re not allowed in school’ because they’re truant,” Rios said. “They end up in the streets and become vulnerable.”</p>\n<p>Rios said many struggling high school students receive mostly informational support from teachers and emotional support is largely overlooked.</p>\n<p>“We just see you as a student, an empty container to be filled with knowledge, that doesn’t have anything to offer me as an educator except to sit there and take notes,” Rios said. “Right now, a lot of emotional connection is lost in the educational system.”</p>\n<p>Rios also said he wants to advocate for educational curriculum based on restorative justice rather than punishment.</p>\n<p>“The best way to teach kids a lesson when they mess up is to give them love, connection, emotional support and, of course, holding them accountable,” Rios said. “We need more restorative justice.”</p>\n<p>Last April, Rios spoke at T.E.D.xUCSB, a locally organized T.E.D. event featuring UCSB professors from various departments. In his talk, Rios said the generation currently in higher education is sometimes considered the “dumbest” and most “narcissistic,” but he does not believe this to be true.</p>\n<p>“We got it all wrong — politicians, education systems, the media,” Rios said. “In national surveys and local studies, we’re finding that your generation craves emotional connection — that your generation actually empathizes in a larger, deeper way than former generations.”</p>\n<p>Also at the T.E.D.x event, Rios said educators need to employ a more emotional method when teaching the millennial generation, as it is more focused on personal connection and social impact than generations before.</p>\n<p>“When we teach to the heart, the mind follows,” Rios said. “When we connect with [students] in an emotional way, in a compassionate way, it opens up avenues for them to learn in an academic setting.”</p>\n<p>According to Rios, presenting in New York will be an important opportunity to convey his message about education reform.</p>\n<p>“I have the potential to leave a message to the world about how we could help kids that are on the street corners lost, kids that are abused, kids that society has forgotten about, kids that have been called criminals and thugs,” Rios said.</p>\n<p>Second-year undeclared major Navid de Leede said Rios’s sociology class encouraged him to take action to improve the educational achievement gap at his old high school.</p>\n<p>“We went to Professor Rios’s office hours and asked him, because what are you gonna do with a problem that’s been ingrained for years in our specific hometown?” de Leede said.</p>\n<p>Second-year pre-biology student Anthony Lavezzo said Rios helped jump-start the educational program with de Leede at his high school.</p>\n<p>“He was more like guiding us rather than pushing his own philosophy. He gave us recognition after we developed our project,” Lavezzo said.</p>\n<p>According to de Leede, Rios spoke extensively about educational inequality against under-privileged students during his lectures.</p>\n<p>“We learned that he was very passionate about not leaving students behind because of their financial situation or their socioeconomic background,” de Leede said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 8 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65681\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65681\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/","id":2675,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[2674,2673,2672],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga","biography":"Not available","articles":[2578,2579,2586,2593,2645,2675,3603,3854,4609,4636],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Workshop Aims To Educate on Cultural Appropriation","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.) and the American Indian Student Association held a workshop on cultural appropriation Tuesday evening in the MultiCultural Center (MCC).

Co-chair and third-year biology major Karen Sidhu said lack of understanding is the biggest cause of cultural appropriation.</p>\n<p>“I feel like [people] don’t know how much they’re damaging people who are hurt by what they do,” Sidhu said. “They don’t see what they’re doing and they don’t see the effects of it.”</p>\n<p>Sidhu said students should avoid wearing costumes that might be considered cultural appropriation.</p>\n<p>“If your costume could potentially offend someone, don’t wear it,” Sidhu said.</p>\n<p>S.C.O.R.E. Co-chair and third-year global studies major Unique Vance said many students feel it is acceptable for them to borrow from other cultures because they view themselves as “colorblind.”</p>\n<p>“A lot of people don’t want to recognize race or racism even though the dynamics are still there,” Vance said. “Instead, they’d rather say ‘Oh I don’t see color, so it doesn’t matter if I wear this or do this and that; I’m showing respect.’”</p>\n<p>Vance said students need to be open to criticism from minorities who feel their culture is being appropriated.</p>\n<p>“If somebody does come talk to you or call you out on cultural appropriating their culture or another culture, don’t just close your mind to it,” Vance said. “Don’t just think people are attacking you, because it’s a really big issue.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65877\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1679167283\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65889\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65877\" data-attachment-id=\"65877\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/workshop-aims-to-educate-on-cultural-appropriation/culturalappropriation_by-riley-esguerra-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Riley Esguerra\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1445926356\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"1000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CulturalAppropriation_by Riley Esguerra-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65877\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Riley Esguerra/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65877\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riley Esguerra/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>According to Vance, white people are routinely praised for cultural appropriation, and elements taken from minority cultures often become popularized by white celebrities.</p>\n<p>“All these cultural hairstyles and clothes from people of color are becoming mainstream and accepted now [that] they’ve been put on white models or actresses or celebrities, like the braids and the cornrows,” Vance said. “There is a different perception of that compared to a black person wearing it.”</p>\n<p>S.C.O.R.E.

three-floor residence for visiting scholar physicists located adjacent to the San Clemente Villages, scheduled to open late next year.</p>\n<p>American businessman and philanthropist Charlie Munger donated $65 million to be used for constructing the Visiting Scholars Residence, a 75,000-square-foot building located on El Colegio Road west of San Clemente apartments. The Visiting Scholars Residence for KITP includes meeting rooms, shared kitchens, dining rooms, a gym and 61 apartment style, fully-furnished private bedrooms with private bathrooms. The residence will also house a flag hall to display national flags of current visiting scholars. Construction began October 2014 and the Visiting Scholars Residence is planned to open late 2016. KITP is a research facility created in 1979 which hosts programs such as Deconstructing the Sense of Smell and Dynamics and Evolution of Earth-like Planets.</p>\n<p>KITP residence manager James Brill said he currently collaborates with visiting scholars to coordinate housing in Isla Vista and Santa Barbara. According to Brill, he contributed to the layout design of the Visiting Scholars Residence and attributes the success of the construction to Munger’s donation.</p>\n<p>“We had a very informal rental program … so as a result, years ago, they really thought about making some sort of residence,” Brill said. “Then, as we kept adding more and more scientists, it became a definite need, and then just last year Charlie Munger decided to give us a very, very generous grant to build the residence.”</p>\n<p>Brill said the residence will accommodate visiting scholars at UCSB as well as their families.</p>\n<p>“We’ve designed a lot of the rooms to be family friendly — we have like a child’s play room and we want to make sure nothing is stopping you from coming and being as productive as you can possibly be while you’re here,” Brill said.</p>\n<p>According to Brill, the meeting rooms allow visiting physicists to interact off-campus and to conduct their work in their living setting.</p>\n<p>“If you’ve got everyone working on a program, you’re all together, which is something the physicists really wanted,” Brill said. “It’s really nice that you can do a lot of intensive work no matter where you are.”</p>\n<p>Brill said the exterior of the Visiting Scholars Residence for KITP is meant to resemble Santa Barbara architecture.</p>\n<p>“Because we have such a big international group, we tried to tie it into the construction that we have in Santa Barbara … we want it to fit into the aesthetic of the neighborhood,” Brill said. “The main goal of KITP is to get people from all parts of the world to get together.”</p>\n<p>Director of KITP and professor of astrophysics and cosmology Lars Bildsten said KITP hosts programs year round to “capture frontier topics” and provide a venue for open discussions.</p>\n<p>“The major thing that the KITP provides for the university is a huge flock of physicists that come for long periods and interact mostly with each other, but most of our activities are open to the campus,” Bildsten said. “So we get a lot of physics graduates students, mathematical graduate students, biology students who come and interact with the visitors.”</p>\n<p>UCSB professor of biophysics and KITP permanent member Boris Shraiman said KITP is a “fantastic” place physicists can visit to be inspired.</p>\n<p>“[The] new residence will allow our physicists to stay together and keep working and thinking about science 24/7,” Shraiman said. “It will become immediately an attraction and I expect to go there in the evening to hang out with the scientists.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

and drought sustainability. <em>Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB is participating in the UC-wide #UCool Campus Challenge from Oct. 6 to Dec. 10 in an effort to reduce the University’s carbon footprint and make positive contributions to the environment.</p>\n<p>University of California and UC Berkeley’s Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory created #UCool with the goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2025. The campaign, modeled after the Cool California Cities Challenge, encourages students to accumulate points for each university by completing 50 online pledge challenges. The pledges include energy efficient moves such as switching to LED lighting and turning off computer monitors. Participants will have opportunities to win eco-efficient prizes such as solar-powered cellphone chargers, and the university with the highest score will be deemed the “Coolest UC Campus.”</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Chris Berry said the challenge will require a large amount of student participation to be effective, but he hopes the goal of carbon neutrality will be reached.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a really cool campaign, and [with] more incentive for students to do it, it could be meaningful,” Berry said. “If we really are interested in [achieving] carbon neutrality, the school can do all they can, but if you have students who don’t care and don’t do work, we’re not going to achieve that goal.”</p>\n<p>Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) Co-chair and third-year computer science and environmental studies double-major Nicholas Frey said the most difficult part of the #UCool challenge is encouraging students to participate in the event.</p>\n<p>“One of the harder challenges is changing people’s behavior on things,” Frey said. “One of the major issues is getting the student population engaged and educated on how they can be sustainable in their actions.”</p>\n<p>According to Frey, UCSB needs total student and faculty involvement for the campaign to achieve the 2025 goal.</p>\n<p>“I think you need infrastructure change, so you need to be, like, adding solar on campus to make it carbon neutral, but I don’t think it’s totally possible if you don’t have faculty and student engagement,” Frey said. “The whole campus can’t become carbon neutral if it’s just the facilities; it has to be the people also.”</p>\n<p>Frey said students should contribute anything they can to the challenge even if they cannot be consistent in their actions.</p>\n<p>“[A misconception] is that you have to be absolutely perfect, and if you slip up you’ll be criticized. That’s not the point; people shouldn’t feel … discouraged to be sustainable,” Frey said. “We don’t live in a world where being some perfect hippie environmentalist is even possible. I just encourage people to learn and explore.”</p>\n<p>According to Associated Students Environmental Program Director Sarah Siedschlag, UCSB has already made great strides towards becoming more environmentally friendly.</p>\n<p>“UCSB has done a lot. For a research university of our size, we’re actually very good in water conservation … the vast majority of our landscape is done with recycled water,” Siedschlag said. “We are prepared, or becoming prepared, for a situation in the future where we might just have longer and longer droughts.”<br>\nSiedschlag said she hopes the Cool Campus Challenge will encourage students and faculty to “engage as groups” in efforts toward environmental conservation.</p>\n<p>“I’m hoping that it gets students to think about it and also makes it something that people talk about and is part of their daily lives, and that people don’t just do themselves but encourage their friends to do,” Siedschlag said. “I think that’s what’s really fun — people are building teams with the Cool Campus Challenge and getting really competitive about it.”</p>\n<p>According to Siedschlag, UC achieving carbon neutrality by 2025 is an attainable goal.</p>\n<p>“I think it depends on what you include and how far you are willing to go,” Siedschlag said.</p>\n<p>According to professor of sociology John Foran, the environment is the “defining issue” of the century.</p>\n<p>“The biggest issue is climate change. It is the biggest existential threat to humanity ever because it calls the whole future into question,” Foran said. “We really have to make deep, deep changes in the ways we organize ourselves in society.”</p>\n<p>According to Foran, converting to a vegetarian or vegan diet is “without question, the single most important” factor in reducing students’ carbon footprint. Foran said the Cool Campus Challenge should emphasize the importance of this change.</p>\n<p>“This is an important thing to underline: the UC Cool Campus Challenge and the perspective of the impact of food, diet and individual behavior change,” Foran said. “The Campus Challenge, as good as it is, needs to be recalibrated to the reality of that. That is good for climate, that is good for our health, pollution, good for the oceans, and it’s good for reducing inequality on a global scale.”</p>\n<p>Berry also said he believes food choices have a very real effect on the environment.</p>\n<p>“One of the biggest things [affecting] environmental climate change is how we eat, and Americans really enjoy meat, and meat is detrimental to the environment, especially in the way it is produced,” Berry said.</p>\n<p>According to Siedschlag, UCSB has a good chance at winning the challenge because of student and faculty dedication to the environment.</p>\n<p>“I think we do have a good chance,” Siedschlag said. “We’ve got a lot of really dedicated students and a lot of groups that have gotten really into it, there’s still plenty of time left, and I think we can definitely do it.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65679\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucool-challenge-seeks-carbon-neutrality/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65679\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucool-challenge-seeks-carbon-neutrality/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucool-challenge-seeks-carbon-neutrality/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucool-challenge-seeks-carbon-neutrality/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/ucool-challenge-seeks-carbon-neutrality/","id":2672,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2671,2670,2669],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
