Silence is complicity,” he said. “[Silence] emboldens the small number of sick people that are out there.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79251\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79251\" data-attachment-id=\"79251\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-24/biden-expresses-hope-for-the-future-through-students/al_joebiden-171021-dustinharris-02/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-79251\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AL_JoeBiden-171021-DustinHarris-02.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-79251\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Biden began his night in front of a sold-out crowd at the Arlington Theatre in Santa Barbara. <em>Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB sociology professor Kum-Kum Bhavnani joined Biden onstage for the Q&amp;A portion at the end of the lecture. Biden and Bhavnani discussed gun control, race relations in the U.S. and Biden’s son Beau’s battle with brain cancer.</p>\n<p>Though he often became visibly uncomfortable and withdrawn, Biden spoke with eloquence of his great personal tragedies.

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza, a UC San Diego alum, last came to UCSB nearly 10 years ago when she worked for the University of California Student Association.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Setting the tone for an intersectional conversation about social justice, Garza welcomed the full auditorium by asking the audience to acknowledge that they were standing on land once occupied by Chumash indigenous people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She then expressed her support for the list of demands from the Black Student Union, Black Student Engagement program and Black Resource Committee, which includes ensuring that black students make up more than 5 percent of the university’s student population.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also supported the idea to hire two full-time black psychologists on campus and spoke of the psychological effects of controversial speakers invited to the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Emotional wellness is important for everybody, not just black students,” she said, “but certainly in a campus environment, where I hear there was just a speaker here talking about the lies and division of Black Lives Matter.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Shapiro spoke at Campbell Hall in February for his event titled “Lies, Prejudice, and Division: The Legacy of the #BLM Movement,” which was later named “The Regressive Left, ‘Social Justice’ and #BlackLivesMatter.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said narratives of history impact our present and future. She said “this country is powered by the engine of amnesia” because historical aspects are often “conveniently” left out in conversation about BLM.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza went on to say that the nation has a history of racially prejudiced “laws, policies and practices,” which she said are “deliberately designed to rob some of power in favor of giving others power.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She noted that of the “two million people locked up … one million of those people” are African American. She said they are not incarcerated because they are “inherently criminal.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is not liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican; this is just what is,” she said. “It’s because there are laws that disproportionately target black people for things that all people do, but not all people get put in cages for their lives.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This July will mark the four-year anniversary of BLM, and Garza said she wanted to make it clear that it is not just a movement for black lives, “but a movement to save all of our lives.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said there are misunderstandings of the movement that distract from its message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Black Lives Matter started as a love note to black people, but it is a demand and a call to action,” Garza said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77388\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77388\" data-attachment-id=\"77388\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-02/black-lives-matter-co-founder-debunks-blm-myths-at-campbell-hall/alicia-garza-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"768,512\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Alicia Garza-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-77388\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77388\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said this movement began in generations prior to hers and is now a continuation of a long legacy of struggle in the United States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza also outlined three “myths” of BLM: the notions that it is anti-police, anti-white and black supremacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said the movement is not anti-police, but, rather, it is against the perpetuation of cycles of violence. She said she believes the cycle will end when someone is courageous enough to say that the institutions and systems in place “are not working.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza also said the allegation that BLM is a black supremacy group “just doesn’t make sense.” The activist group does not want to perpetuate the same systems that oppress people but, rather, to transform the powers that operate those systems, Garza said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christine Dolan, associate director at the Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity and one of the organizers for the event, said BLM week is about “coalition building.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dolan said they believe the event was an effective way to bring people together and “center the Black Lives Matter movement on campus.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fabiola Pérez, a fourth-year biological anthropology major, said she thought Garza made “all these issues human” and spoke about them in realistic terms.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like a lot of the stuff we see is so out there and it feels so far away, when in reality it’s very immediate and very close,” Pérez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said she wanted the audience to leave thinking about “the ways we want to create movement and the ways we establish power.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the U.S. needs “really courageous white people” to realize white supremacy does exist, adding that economic struggles are national concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “White folks need this movement,” she said. “They’re being fed a lie, too.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77525\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-02/black-lives-matter-co-founder-debunks-blm-myths-at-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77525\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-02/black-lives-matter-co-founder-debunks-blm-myths-at-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-02/black-lives-matter-co-founder-debunks-blm-myths-at-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-02/black-lives-matter-co-founder-debunks-blm-myths-at-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-02/black-lives-matter-co-founder-debunks-blm-myths-at-campbell-hall/","id":2395,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2394,2393,2392],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
