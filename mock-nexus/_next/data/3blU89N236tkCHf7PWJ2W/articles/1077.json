Following a berth into the College Insider Mid-Major Top-25 poll, the Gauchos continued their Big West dominance to hand Davis its third straight loss and drop the Aggies to 0-3 in Big West play.</p>\n<p>While Ar’mond Davis impressively went 5-7 from deep en route to his prolific near double-double performance, the Gauchos as a whole shot 45.8% from beyond the arc. They held the Ags to just 27% on threes despite UC Davis shooting more efficiently from the field than SB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Reigning Big West Conference MVP TJ Shorts II posted 11 points for the Aggies on 5-11 shooting while dragging down a team-high five boards in the process, but when a 5-foot-9 point guard is the team’s leading rebounding, it’s certainly apparent why Davis has been struggling this year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos out-rebounded UC Davis 37-21– a monstrous 16-rebound differential made possible by 12 offensive boards from UCSB which led to 12 second chance points on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>Although the Aggies attack came out firing with a 10-0 run to open up the game, the Gauchos fired back with a triple from junior guard Max Heidegger to get SB on the board.</p>\n<p>“The first four-minute war, we were down 10-0. I felt like I was back at Washington,” joked Pasternack. “I better change my pregame speech and my half time speech.”</p>\n<p>Heidegger quarterbacked a 14-4 stretch for UCSB after freshman guard Sekou Toure muscled into the paint for consecutive offensive rebounds and dipped it back to a wide-open Jay Nagle, and the three-point specialist struck again to tie it up at 14 with a trey on the right wing.</p>\n<p>Nagle had eight points in the first half while shooting 3-4 from the field and 2-3 behind the perimeter as he added the final five points of the half for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UC Davis pulled back ahead with a pair of free-throws, but Ar’mond Davis answered right back with his first three of the game which came unassisted as shook his defender in isolation at the top of the arc and fired from deep to put SB on top 17-16.</p>\n<p>To close out the half, Santa Barbara posted 26 points with big threes from four separate Gauchos to lead 43-31 at the break. After one, there were six Gauchos that had notched five or more points with Armond Davis leading the way scoring 10 points in 14 minutes.</p>\n<p>Out of the break, the Ags weren’t done yet. Davis went on a 14-5 run to open the half on a strong note once again led by junior guard Joe Mooney who carried out a 3-point play when he cut through defenders, drew contact, and finished at the rack to cut the deficit to just three at 48-45.</p>\n<p>That was the closest the Aggies would be to a comeback as Ar’mond Davis took over with 13 points in the second half with a triad of triples to balloon the lead to 64-54 with 3:53 to play.</p>\n<p>“I really challenged Ar’mond Davis about offensive rebounding last night and I think he was a monster,” said Head Coach Joe Pasternack. “Four offensive rebounds and he was a complete player…to get a victory like this on the road, this is amazing.”</p>\n<p>UCSB is off for a week off following its sixth straight victory, but has a big week ahead as it remains on a 3-game road trip with games at Cal State Fullerton and Cal State Long Beach next Thursday and Saturday respectively.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

It will be crucial for junior center Natalia Bruening to rebound the ball consistently and limit second chance opportunities for Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a second scorer must emerge behind Miller in order to prevent opposing defenses from doubling her. There are many different players on the team that have the potential to fill this role, including Bruening, who can score easily in the paint, as well as sophomore guard Bri Anugwom, who is constantly in attack mode and can lead to getting to the line.</p>\n<p>One of the strengths for Long Beach State is their ability for every player on the floor to be a threat from behind the three point line. Santa Barbara must play with consistent ball pressure that may lead to turnovers for the 49ers and fastbreak baskets for the ‘Chos.</p>\n<p>Although it has been a difficult year thus far for Santa Barbara, there are many positives to take away, especially the team’s consistent effort. Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson has been able to bring the best out of her young team and will look to build on the habits being developed this season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will look to pick up their first conference win as they face Long Beach State at 4 p.m. this Saturday.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Jan. 17, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

The Gauchos are red hot entering this game, considering their current five-game win streak that they’d like to extend over the Aggies.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s most recent win occurred last weekend in another Big West showdown at home against UC Riverside, which ended in a 72-64 final score that favored the Gaucho hosts.</p>\n<p>On the season, UCSB stands at an overall record of 13-3, with an outstanding 9-0 record when at home.</p>\n<p>Although on paper this upcoming match may appear to be a trap game, UCSB is actually 2-3 when it comes to their performance on the road.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, UC Davis is 3-2 when defending their home court, so both teams will want to bring those respective records to an even .500 win percentage.</p>\n<p>A win for the Gauchos will bring their win streak to six in a row and further cement their status at the top of the Big West Conference standings.</p>\n<p>As for UC Davis, the Aggies will want to get their act together quickly, even in this unlikeliest of matchups.</p>\n<p>On the season, UC Davis holds an overall record of 4-12, including constantly poor showings on the road with a 0-9 away record.</p>\n<p>The month of January has been a bit fairer for the Aggies, who have won one of three matches over this period.</p>\n<p>Although both of those losses were well fought and one of them was an overtime heartbreaker, these pair of road games were both Big West confrontations and are the reason for UC Davis’ presence at the bottom of conference standings.</p>\n<p>Historically, this will be the 39th time these two sides have faced off against each other.</p>\n<p>From the 38 other previous meetings, UCSB leads favorably with a 29-9 all-time series record. The last meeting between these two occurred last year, where the Aggies upset the at-home Gauchos by a final score of 71-54.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, conference matchups are always prone to go either way, regardless of a perceived advantage.</p>\n<p>After an incredible showing last week against UC Riverside, UCSB’s freshman forward Amadou Sow is this week’s one to watch.</p>\n<p>At 6’9”, Sow enters the UC Davis game following a career-high 22 points and nine rebounds; each stat was game-leading in the aforementioned match.</p>\n<p>A vital part in head coach Pasternak’s team layout, Sow has been tearing up stat lines all season long, leading his side in total rebounds, with 100 to his name, and fourth in both total scoring and minutes played.</p>\n<p>Another player to watch would be the Gauchos’ senior forward Jarriesse Blackmon.</p>\n<p>Slowly starting to see more consistent minutes, Blackmon has made the most of his play time as he leads his team in total blocks with 17, and he is third overall in total rebounds with 67.</p>\n<p>Both Sow and Blackmon will feature as UCSB’s premier rim protectors against UC Davis.</p>\n<p>On the opposing end, Aggies’ senior guard TJ Shorts II is in charge of making the offense function.</p>\n<p>As UC Davis’ leader in total points and assists, Shorts II already has 239 points and 60 assists to his name.</p>\n<p>He’ll also be hungry for a win after coming just short against last week’s opponent in Long Beach State, a match where he added 19 points, five assists and three steals to his tally.</p>\n<p>Coming off a team-leading 29 points against Long Beach State, junior guard Joe Mooney will be in fine form entering the UCSB game.</p>\n<p>Mooney appears to be the Aggies’ three-point specialist as he leads his side in three-pointers, with a total of 29 on the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will want to keep both Mooney and Shorts II in mind come game time.</p>\n<p>Although Davis is currently in last place, their play so far this year has been an outlier, not the norm. With the return of AJ John to the lineup for the Aggies, the Gauchos can’t afford to take the win for granted.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be the visiting side this Thursday, Jan. 17, as they travel to UC Davis for a tip-off time 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Jan. 17, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85659\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/ucsb-heads-north-to-take-on-last-place-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85659\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/ucsb-heads-north-to-take-on-last-place-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/ucsb-heads-north-to-take-on-last-place-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/ucsb-heads-north-to-take-on-last-place-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/ucsb-heads-north-to-take-on-last-place-uc-davis/","id":1076,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1075,1074,1073],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks to Serve Seventh Place Irvine, First Place Fullerton","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos look to improve upon their solid 4-1 Big West record and third place conference standing when it takes on seventh place UCI and first place CSU Fullerton.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s tennis team will be hitting the road this week to face two Big West foes, UC Irvine and CSU Fullerton, as it looks to continue its dominant start to conference play.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69452\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"921958633\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69540\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69452\" data-attachment-id=\"69452\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucsb-looks-to-serve-seventh-place-irvine-first-place-fullerton/amanda-atanasson-returns-the-ball-to-the-opponent-jenny-luo-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Amanda Atanasson returns the ball to the opponent.

Participating in UCSB’s lone game victory was sophomore Natalia Da Silveira. Da Silveira was one half of a doubles team that won although Santa Barbara lost the opening doubles point.</p>\n<p>While Irvine managed to defeat UCSB in last year’s matchup, the Anteaters possess a youthful roster in which a majority of their players are underclassmen. As a result of this youth, UCI has struggled with establishing consistency on the court.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters have used 18 different duos in doubles play. Nonetheless, in singles play, aside from senior Sarah Gong, every player on UCI’s team has been used in different positions from the two spot to the six.</p>\n<p>The inconsistency may be a contributing factor to such a disappointing season, as thus far the Anteaters sit within the bottom of the pack in the conference standings with their three victories coming against UC Davis, Middle Tennessee and Grand Canyon University.</p>\n<p>Contrary to UCI’s consistency woes, CSUF has been one of the conference’s most improved teams. After a seventh place Big West finish last season, 10-12 overall and 2-6 conference record, the Titans are currently on a three-match winning streak with just three matches remaining.</p>\n<p>However, although the Titans have an impressive record, they have played virtually no ranked opposition unlike the other top three teams in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the last time these two teams played, it did not end well for the Titans. UCSB swept Fullerton 7-0 and could possibly upset the Titans as it is off to an encouraging start.</p>\n<p>“We would hope so [[We would hope [to beat the Titans]]], we have a shot in every position and they have improved a lot and we have as well,” Head Coach Simon Thibodeau said. “They are tough. We have to take them very seriously.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton standout junior Alexis Valenzuela is definitely a player to watch out for on the Titans’ side of the court. In singles, she leads the team with a 14-3 dual record and all of those are at the one spot. She is also one half of a fairly tough doubles team alongside junior Camille De Leon, as they both have stringed together a nearly flawless doubles record.</p>\n<p>The pair of juniors have a 12-1 dual record in doubles all at the one slot as well. Valenzuela and De Leon will more than likely need to face off against UCSB’s power duo of junior Stefani Stojic and sophomore Palina Dubavets, who are currently ranked at the No. 15 spot in the ITA rankings.</p>\n<p>UCSB, with only four matches remaining in the regular season, is currently standing at third in the Big West conference after recently enduring its only conference loss against defending Big West Conference champions Long Beach State last Saturday.</p>\n<p>This Saturday, April 9 the Gauchos will play at UC Irvine at 12 p.m. On Sunday, April 10 UCSB will face off against CSU Fullerton at 11 a.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69540\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucsb-looks-to-serve-seventh-place-irvine-first-place-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69540\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucsb-looks-to-serve-seventh-place-irvine-first-place-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucsb-looks-to-serve-seventh-place-irvine-first-place-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucsb-looks-to-serve-seventh-place-irvine-first-place-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucsb-looks-to-serve-seventh-place-irvine-first-place-fullerton/","id":1074,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[1073,1072,1071],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
