The new design is more simple and straightforward, and it will allow for easy navigation of the library’s database and its material.</p></div>\n<p>The UCSB Library website got a major remodel at the beginning of Winter Quarter, updating its outdated homepage with an accessible new look.</p>\n<p>It is the first redesign of the site in more than five years. The new appearance is intended to reflect elements of the UCSB Library’s physical renovation and mirror its status at a competitive research university.</p>\n<p>Marcos Aguilar, the reference and information supervisor at the library, said the transition is based on creating a new online database system and improving the availability of library materials for students and faculty.</p>\n<p>The new online database is a catalog software update that was outsourced through a software company. This update provides a simple navigational structure and reduces the number of pages required for users to find specific research materials.</p>\n<p>“The main motivation has to do with material circulation,” Aguilar said. “Right now, the catalog looks the same as it did before. The homepage is sleeker and more visually stimulating, though.”</p>\n<p>The reason for the redesign was not only to modernize the website but to make click-thru links smoother and add mobile-friendliness. The library is currently installing the catalog update and should complete it by the next school year.</p>\n<p>According to the Library’s website, the new catalog takes advantage of “increased database-driven functionality to minimize duplicate content.”</p>\n<p>The website revamp is the result of a “thoughtful review process” that involved conducting user testing, collecting survey data and website analytics over many years.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74946\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74946\" data-attachment-id=\"74946\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/library-website-gets-first-facelift-in-5-years/library-photo-courtesy-of-karen-lindell/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Library-Photo-Courtesy-of-Karen-Lindell.jpg?fit=2000%2C1071&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1071\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"library-photo-courtesy-of-karen-lindell\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Library-Photo-Courtesy-of-Karen-Lindell.jpg?fit=250%2C134&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Library-Photo-Courtesy-of-Karen-Lindell.jpg?fit=888%2C475&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74946\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Library-Photo-Courtesy-of-Karen-Lindell-1024x548.jpg?resize=888%2C475\" alt=\"The UCSB Library opened its new building in January 2016.

The original Davidson Library was built in 1954, and it was intended to be the geographical center of the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>The new building is considerably more modern and features drop-lighting, a new transfer center, expanded seating areas and a café open during daylight hours.</p>\n<p>Since the building’s reconstruction, the university has also hired staff members to push the facility into a new era of technology.  This summer, Thomas Padilla came onboard as the first ever humanities data curator in the UC system. Padilla works with humanities departments which can vary in data usage from traditional S.T.E.M. fields.</p>\n<p>New Mac computers also made their debut in the Learning Commons earlier this summer, which are now the only Mac computers available on campus for general student use.</p>\n<p>Funding for the computers came from the library’s budget, mostly made up of state money and private donations. The library also plans to use $30,000 to $40,000 from the Class of 2016 senior class gift to install additional technology.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, Jan.

the effects of this increase, as 1,000 more students enrolled for the 2016-17 school year than the 2015-16 year.</p>\n<p>In March, the Chemistry Department faced challenges trying to accommodate upper division students in the 116BL course, a prerequisite needed to complete the major. Over 20 students were waitlisted, with no facility space to add another lab.</p>\n<p>Rachel Alvelais, a third-year chemistry major, had extensive concerns regarding whether she would be able to graduate on time.</p>\n<p>“For most of us juniors, at this point in time we start to think about graduate school applications, which are due at the middle or end of Fall Quarter,” Alvelais said. “If we have to stay an extra Fall Quarter, then that means that we can’t apply to graduate school next year and we would have to find something to do … for a whole 13 months while we already would have been in graduate school.”</p>\n<p>Taking a summer class, an option that has been offered by several departments, is a choice that does not appeal to students like Alvelais, who did not initially plan to take summer courses and have other internship or research obligations.</p>\n<p>Alvelais, however, said she feels that if she was not able to get into the lab course needed to graduate, she would have no choice but to take summer classes, despite the financial burden.</p>\n<p>The department added more students to each existing lab class, and Alvelais was able to take the class she needed to graduate and do research over the summer; however, her experience is indicative of a more widespread problem.</p>\n<p>Steven Buratto, chair of the Chemistry Department, said he is concerned about a lack of resources for the increasing number of enrolled students.</p>\n<p>“The University of California is great. You get a great education for a reasonable price, comparatively speaking,” Buratto said. “But we don‘t want to get so overcrowded that we can’t accommodate the students that we have.”</p>\n<p>The Chemistry and Biology Departments face issues with physical lab space, a lack of graduate students to work as teaching assistants and a lack of faculty.</p>\n<p>“We’ve reached our capacity, and so at some point throwing money at it doesn’t work,” said Stephen Poole, chair of the Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology (MCDB) Department. “You need faculty to teach these students, you need graduate students to work as TAs, so money could help there; we could expand our graduate program.”</p>\n<p>These restrictions are not felt only within S.T.E.M. fields.</p>\n<p>Alison Brysk, the global studies department chair, said the department also faces similar space restrictions: Designated class sizes are quickly surpassing the physical capacity of lecture halls.</p>\n<p>Such restrictions make certain classes more competitive in terms of enrollment, which limits the ability of non-global studies majors to enroll in popular global studies courses.</p>\n<p>Though other UCs have begun offering classes during the evening, there are several challenges to doing this at UCSB. Poole said this is not a viable solution due to the staff needed to prepare labs and the fact that certain lecture halls, like Campbell Hall, are used for other purposes at night.</p>\n<p>Many departments also lack qualified TAs, which limits the departments’ abilities to provide further assistance for undergraduate students.</p>\n<p>“Graduate students are critical to both the teaching and research missions of our university,” Napolitano said in a statement. “They serve key roles in supporting the academic inquiry and discovery of our faculty, as well as the teaching load for our undergraduates.”</p>\n<p>UCSB, however, has not increased the number of graduate students sufficiently; according to campus profiles authored by the university’s Office of Budget and Planning, this year there were 73 less new graduate students than there were for the 2015-16 year.</p>\n<p>Larger class sizes are difficult for students to get into and in many cases can negatively affect students’ learning experiences.</p>\n<p>Jerry Chung, the education coordinator for the actuarial science department, said large class sizes hinder students’ ability to interact with each other and increase their own knowledge.</p>\n<p>“An unintended consequence of huge classes is that students in the actuarial science major find it increasingly difficult to network and learn from one another,” Chung said.</p>\n<p>To combat this issue, students in the department have created UCSB’s Actuarial Association, which hosts educational and social events to network with each other.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the effects of increased enrollment extend past the classroom.</p>\n<p>This March, Wyatt Licht, a fourth-year communication major, started a petition to stop bike impounding across campus. The petition alleged that there were not enough bike racks on campus for all students, a sentiment that 481 petition-signers agreed with.</p>\n<p>Student services such as Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) have also been affected.</p>\n<p>“It certainly affects the demand for our services; there’s more students on campus, which means there’s more students wanting or needing mental health services,” said C.A.P.S director Jeanne Stanford.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have enough space,” Stanford added. “So if we had more space then we would be able to hire more psychologists, and if we had more psychologists then we would be able to accommodate more students.”</p>\n<p>Between 10 to 15 percent of students use C.A.P.S., and with outreach programs, Stanford estimates that they are able to reach around 25 percent of the student population.</p>\n<p>She said that an increase in population density in a small space increases “irritability, frustration [and] anxiety.”</p>\n<p>Stanford also said increased enrollment extends past C.A.P.S. and “affects everything,” including longer wait times at the Office of Financial Aid and the Registrar.</p>\n<p>The increasing numbers also concern undergraduate housing. While the San Joaquin Residence Hall currently under construction will help mitigate the housing strain, a significant increase in freshmen could pose problems.</p>\n<p>“If there was a dramatic increase, then we would have to strategize about how to accommodate them,” said Mario Muñoz, associate director of Resident Placement &amp; Assignment Services. “We would probably have to look at how we distribute the spaces that we have.”</p>\n<p>Chuck Haines, acting assistant chancellor of the Office of Budget and Planning, said that while we currently have enough space for students, more housing will have to be built in the future.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang told the Nexus in an interview Tuesday that the university wants to ensure that dorm rooms are no more than triples, and he said philanthropic support of campus housing is an option for the future.</p>\n<p>“Any philanthropic support of housing would lower the cost to students,” Haines said.</p>\n<p>Next year, there will be a small decrease in the number of freshmen admitted, but total undergraduate enrollment will still increase slightly due to an increased emphasis on admitting transfer students.</p>\n<p>According to Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall, UCSB has been steadily increasing enrollment according to the Long Range Development Plan (LRDP), which has a cap on enrollment at 25,000 students.</p>\n<p>State pressures to increase student enrollment, however, have forced UCSB to grow at a rate much higher than the LRDP suggests.</p>\n<p>“The state has not been very cooperative,” Marshall said. “The state has not been giving us adequate resources.”</p>\n<p>As enrollment increases, so do the costs, including C.A.P.S., faculty and other services.</p>\n<p>“We need a long-term plan,” said Yang. “I and the deans and the budget planning team are addressing this problem.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 13, 2017 print issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

A dean will be selected by July of this year. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The College of Creative Studies (CCS) Vetting Committee is in the midst of searching for a new dean of the college, increasing transparency in the process by inviting students and faculty to participate in the vetting process.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang and Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall created the committee in April 2016 and began their search for a new dean of the college during Fall Quarter. The committee has opened town hall meetings to the public during which the applicants are interviewed for the position.</p>\n<p>The committee will vet the candidates and compile their recommendations for the position to give to Chancellor Yang, who will then choose the new dean by July.</p>\n<p>The position is open to faculty from all departments on campus and initially received around 80 applications. The committee has narrowed the application pool down to four applicants, two from science departments and two from the humanities departments.</p>\n<p>Various constituencies on campus are meeting with the candidates as the committee holds interviews, encouraging participants to have a role in the process, said Omer Blaes, chair of the Vetting Committee and a professor in the physics department.</p>\n<p>“Everyone who has participated in one of these events is free to send us information about their reactions, and we take that information in a confidential fashion,” Blaes said. “The committee evaluates that when considering who we want to recommend to the Chancellor.”</p>\n<p>Blaes has chaired other search committees, including that for the dean of the College of Letters and Sciences, and said while campus-wide interviews were held, there were few people on campus aware of the proceedings. He said everyone in the college was invited because members of CCS wanted more transparency in the vetting and decision-making process.</p>\n<p>The committee also reached out to faculty members in the applicants’ departments to join the meetings and offer advice about the candidates.</p>\n<p>Kathleen Foltz, the interim dean of CSS, said she believes it is “crucial” for candidates to interact with students and faculty at the town hall meetings.</p>\n<p>“You want to have candidates meet with people, and in this position in particular, to meet especially with the students,” Foltz said in an email. “I think it’s wonderful that so many students can meet these candidates and offer feedback to the Search Advisory Committee.”</p>\n<p>Foltz said this type of transparency is common for a candidate search at the administrative level.</p>\n<p>Bruce Tiffney, the previous dean of the college, stepped down from his position in July, and Foltz stepped in to temporarily serve as the dean while the committee vets applicants for the position. Foltz said she is not applying to be the permanent dean.</p>\n<p>Applicants for the administrative position go through a vetting process and answer a series of questions relating to their interest in the dean position and their administrative and leadership experience.</p>\n<p>There are eight majors in CCS, and Blaes stressed the importance of a dean working cohesively with each of them, focusing on undergraduate students’ research and creative processes.</p>\n<p>“The key aspect about this particular dean is that this dean is undergraduate-focused,” Blaes said. “They need to enable bright undergraduates [in] … the creative fields they’re engaged in.”</p>\n<p>He added that the vetting process has allowed the involved faculty members from different departments to interact and discuss the future of the college.</p>\n<p>“It’s one of the rare occasions that I am talking to people from the humanities about what CCS could be and what the whole campus could be in terms of bridging these very different disciplines,” Blaes said.</p>\n<p>“[The college] is what it is now and it’s viewed as a success, but because it brings together people in these different disciplines it could even serve as a nexus for faculty on the campus.”</p>\n<p>After the new dean is chosen, the candidate’s department will need to appoint a new faculty member to the vacancy subsequently created, a process the CCS Vetting Committee will not be a part of.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the new dean will not be expected to teach since the CCS dean position is a full-time commitment.</p>\n<p>“I have great hopes for this position,” Blaes said. “Everyone says CCS is a jewel in the crown at UCSB, and I really believe that. And I hope that we get someone who can make that jewel even greater.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

students filled the UC Santa Barbara campus on Election Day 2016 in protest of president-elect Donald Trump. As the echoes of protests die down throughout the country, students are once again bristling in anticipation of a new presidency that may cause irreparable change throughout the country.</p>\n<p>Undocumented students have fallen into the center of this struggle, pinpointed by Trump’s unfavorable rhetoric regarding undocumented immigrants and President Obama’s 2012 initiative, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).</p>\n<p>The California government, the University of California and university law enforcement now attempt to provide answers in the eight days until inauguration.</p>\n<p>In late 2016, UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang signed a statement endorsed by the Association of American Universities in support of DACA. Chancellors from all 10 UC campuses, including UC President Janet Napolitano, also signed the statement.</p>\n<p>Napolitano, a trained lawyer, was the former United States Secretary of Homeland Security from 2009 to 2013. She was criticized at the beginning of her term for implementing the controversial Secure Communities program, an immigration-enforcement policy that detected undocumented immigrants via fingerprints taken by local police.</p>\n<p>In the last three years, however, she has supported the UC’s D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program for undocumented students, allocated $2.5 million per year for created undocumented student fellowships and granted UC’s Undocumented Legal Services Center $900,000 per year under the Undocumented Student Services Program.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of questions with the incoming Trump administration, what it means for universities and what it means for students,” Napolitano said on Jan. 6, speaking to a group of UC journalists. “We don’t have answers to those questions, nobody knows the answers.”</p>\n<p>To combat the unknown, the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) released a set of principles in December listing the boundaries of university police and medical services. “We are very clear that we are not turning university police into surrogate immigration agents, and we’re not gonna be voluntarily turning over student records,” she said.</p>\n<p>When asked about retaliation from the federal government if the UC does not comply with the new presidency, Napolitano said the UC was not in immediate threat.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of talk, particularly in the Republican party right now, about cutting funding in a lot of areas,” she said. “They haven’t singled out campuses, nor have they singled out campuses that have stated their values as we have.”</p>\n<p>Others, though a small minority, support Trump’s ideas and believe undocumented students do not have a place on UC campuses.</p>\n<p>A student who wished to stay anonymous, fearing retaliation, has begun organizing efforts to report undocumented students who attend UC Santa Barbara. He said the group is in a “planning and monitoring phase only” prior to Trump’s inauguration, hoping for a “likely scenario” that the future president will repeal DACA.</p>\n<p>“If Trump lets us down, then it is possible that this will lead nowhere,” he said. “We have a large and growing number of students on board and we have notified the university of our plans, but for the time being, we are all waiting until January 20th.”</p>\n<p>The group is not affiliated with any campus organization, according to the student, and its goal is ensure that UCSB abides by United States immigration laws.</p>\n<p>“I cannot reveal our tactics yet,” the student said. “All I can say for now, is that we consider ourselves to be an honest and patriotic team of whistleblowers when it comes to the potentially illegal activity happening at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Students who have been vocal about reporting undocumented immigrants on the UCSB campus have received threats on social media, and the student who spoke with the <em>Nexus</em> said he had heard violent, threatening rumors and been called a “fascist and a Nazi.”</p>\n<p>In response to a question regarding students who hope to join similar groups at other UC’s, Napolitano said Jan. 6 that it would be more prudent to focus on reporting criminal activity, rather than young people who travel to the U.S. to gain an education.</p>\n<p>Students are currently in the final planning stages of a large walkout to take place on inauguration day Jan. 20, with the Student Activist Network hosting several meetings to create posters and make maps of a march route.</p>\n<p>Administrators and faculty from UCSB have created an ad-hoc committee to discuss undocumented students’ safety while on campus. Among several ideas, campus administrators hope to distribute “know your rights” pamphlets, create faculty sanctuary homes for students and reinforce mental health services for students who feel threatened.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 15, Santa Barbara Police Chief Lori Luhnow said that the SBPD was committed to protecting individual rights, reassuring concerned residents.</p>\n<p>“We will continue to arrest and seek prosecution of anyone who has committed a crime in Santa Barbara, but the immigration status alone of individuals in Santa Barbara is NOT a matter for police action,” she said in a statement.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74791\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uncertainty-for-undocumented-as-inauguration-looms/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74791\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uncertainty-for-undocumented-as-inauguration-looms/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uncertainty-for-undocumented-as-inauguration-looms/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uncertainty-for-undocumented-as-inauguration-looms/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uncertainty-for-undocumented-as-inauguration-looms/","id":2446,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2445,2444,2443],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
