Wang was last seen Friday morning around 4 a.m., according to Bryant Pahl, a third-year earth science major and Alpha Phi Omega Chapter president.</p>\n<p>A missing persons report was filed for Wang around 9:40 a.m. on Monday morning, according to Charlene Wu, one of Wang’s current housemates in Manzanita Village.</p>\n<p>“Her roommates last saw her at 3 a.m. studying in the dorms, but did not see her the next morning,” Pahl said. “The last message she sent [was] to her little in Alpha Phi Omega at 3:54 a.m.”</p>\n<p>Pahl said the location on her phone is currently off and said he believes her phone is “either dead or turned off.”</p>\n<p>Wang was last seen at an Alpha Phi Omega affiliated event during the fraternity’s general meeting on May 15, Pahl said. Alpha Phi Omega is a co-ed service-based fraternity.</p>\n<p>“She signed up for several service events during the weekend but did not attend any, which is a rare behavior for Annie as she is a very prominent servant leader. In fact, she currently has the most service hours in the fraternity,” Pahl said.</p>\n<p>Several people have posted notices about Wang’s disappearance on the UCSB Free &amp; For Sale Facebook page and other social media sites.</p>\n<p>Wang was later <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-22/missing-ucsb-student-found-deceased-in-santa-ynez-mountains/\">found deceased</a> in the Santa Ynez Mountains, according to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO).</p>\n<p>Her friends set up a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/love-for-annie\">GoFundMe</a> on Wednesday to help her family with funeral expenses, according to the webpage.</p>\n<p><em>Updated: This article was updated to include information from SBSO.</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated: This article was updated to include information about the GoFundMe.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

U-mail accounts will still be accessible through the “U-Mail Web Access” link found on the UCSB U-mail website, according to Amstutz.</p>\n<p>In addition to current email addresses, UCSBNetID@umail.ucsb.edu, students will also have the option of using a new domain name, UCSBNetID@ucsb.edu.</p>\n<p>The CIO recommends that students frequently check their emails and pay attention to any emails detailing the transition of their account.</p>\n<p>“The best thing you can do to prepare is to watch your email and actually read them because you will get an email that lets you know exactly what day [the email server] is swapping for you … That’s all students need to do,” Amstutz said.</p>\n<p>The CIO is working on completing the transition of emails for the Student Affairs division, Kantrim said in an interview with the <em>Nexus</em>. This will complete the migration for the entire UC Santa Barbara faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>Approximately 12,377 out of 15,222 email accounts of UCSB staff and faculty have been fully transitioned to Google as of March 2018, according to Matthew Hall, associate vice chancellor for information technology and chief information officer.</p>\n<p>In a 2016 study done by Student Information Systems &amp; Technology (SIS&amp;T), the university found 65 percent of students with Office 365 U-mail accounts were forwarding their emails to other servers. Of those forwarding, 64 percent of emails were being sent to Gmail.</p>\n<p>Students had proposed switching to Gmail when the university first switched from a local email server to Office 365 in 2012. However, the Google platform at the time was difficult to manage and was not as developed as it is today, according to Joe Sabado, SIS&amp;T executive director.</p>\n<p>The transition to the Google server will allow students, faculty and staff to be on the same platform and easily share documents, calendars and improve overall collaboration, Sabado said.</p>\n<p>Although Gmail provides multi-factor authentication, email phishing and other malware will not see a significant change, according to Sam Horowitz, CIO chief information security officer.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, a mailbox is a mailbox,” Horowitz said in an email. “People still need to be careful with email.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: James Kantrim is the Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) service delivery manager, not the Student Information Systems &amp; Technology (SIS&amp;T) director of strategic architecture and platform integration services as previously stated. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82924\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/from-u-mail-to-gmail/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82924\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/from-u-mail-to-gmail/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/from-u-mail-to-gmail/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/from-u-mail-to-gmail/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/from-u-mail-to-gmail/","id":2256,"author":{"id":81,"name":"Victoria Gurrola"},"related":[2255,2254,2253],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
