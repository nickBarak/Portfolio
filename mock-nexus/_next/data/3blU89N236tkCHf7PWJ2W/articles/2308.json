It’s a really big deal for negotiating leverage with legislators,” Chikukwa said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Chikukwa, the coalition organizers alongside the University of California Student Association (UCSA) and the UC Regents will be going to Sacramento from March 24 to March 26 to present the bill to state legislators and ask for support. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students (A.S.) passed a resolution on March 7 supporting this campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution was presented by Mayela Morales, legislative outreach director for the Coalition, and Justice Dumlao, a third-year global studies major and communication director for the Coalition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Irvine’s A.S. passed their own resolution on Feb. 15 sponsoring the Coalition’s campaign, and UC Santa Cruz, UC Riverside and UC Merced are among others that are discussing their involvement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The most telling signs that someone is going to graduate [in four years] is income level,” Director of Student Outreach for the Coalition, Chadwyck Moore said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a study done by the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) in 2015, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California will see a decrease of 1.1 million college graduates by 2030 due to lack of financial aid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa and the rest of the Coalition began promoting the idea of extending the Cal Grant into summer sessions in order to increase the amount of students that graduate out of UC’s and Cal States within four years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The Coalition’s] whole motive was to educate people first, and then build legislative support,” said Chikukwa.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make the bill more appealing to legislators, the Coalition is asking students to sign a petition in support of it, according to Moore,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a fourth-year political science major.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to show [the legislators] that students are behind this and are watching every step of the way,” Chikukwa said.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cal Grant is expected to include undocumented students as well as offer more financial aid to students from middle income families, added Chikukwa. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Coalition’s platform that was presented to the A.S. claims that the campaign is a small step in the efforts to keep students from marginalized backgrounds in school and to “ultimately create free higher education institutions</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We students need to take this matter into our own hands. Taking out loans.. only increases the over $1.3 trillion of student debt nationwide,” said Morales, a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fourth-year global and chicanx studies double major</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “I’m very optimistic that this bill will be approved.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article inaccurately reported that the funding will be officially coming from Governor Brown’s “Rainy Day Fund,” and has been corrected to show that the Coalition for a Better UC is recommending it come from Brown’s Fund</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82084\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/students-fight-for-bill-to-extend-cal-grant-into-summer/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82084\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/students-fight-for-bill-to-extend-cal-grant-into-summer/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/students-fight-for-bill-to-extend-cal-grant-into-summer/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/students-fight-for-bill-to-extend-cal-grant-into-summer/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/students-fight-for-bill-to-extend-cal-grant-into-summer/","id":2308,"author":{"id":88,"name":"Katie Wolf"},"related":[2307,2306,2305],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":88,"name":"Katie Wolf","biography":"Not available","articles":[2222,2239,2249,2266,2268,2308,2311,2769,3653,3769,3948,4329,4331],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Model U.N.

The opening ceremony will be held in Girvetz Hall, large committees will be in the Theater &amp; Dance Building, small committees will be in the Student Resource Building and the closing ceremony will be in Isla Vista Theater.</p>\n<p>According to SBIMUN Security Council Chair and fourth-year political science and Italian double major Jane Huson, their event is relatively new compared to those held at other universities and will provide students with good preparation for future MUN conferences.</p>\n<p>“Our conference is pretty new and more of an educational one since it is hosted in the fall and a lot of colleges send newer delegates so they can experience it in a less intimidating environment,” Huson said. “A lot of students will go to the New York MUN in the spring and the Berkeley MUN in the winter so this is a jumping off point for the students.”</p>\n<p>The number of travel conferences MUN will be able to attend depends on how much funding they collect from hosting home conferences. The team is planning to attend conferences in New York, Davis, Berkeley and Los Angeles this school year.</p>\n<p>Chair of SBIMUN Human Rights Council and third-year global studies Benjamin Pu said the conference will be a great learning opportunity for many students.</p>\n<p>“This is a great training conference, and for many schools it will be the first conference of the year,” Pu said. “We provide a thorough and rigorous environment for rules and procedures and also emphasize educational aspects as well.”</p>\n<p>Huson said around 400 to 450 delegates from 18 universities throughout California are expected to be at the conference, including UC San Diego, UC Davis, University of Southern California and Stanford University.</p>\n<p>Chair of SBIMUN World Food Program and first-year pre-economics Jason Tsao said he looks forward to the event.</p>\n<p>“This is my first time chairing for a MUN conference and even though it’s going to be a long three days, I’m excited,” Tsao said. “There are training sessions held weekly and that’s where delegates will learn what to do at the conferences.”</p>\n<p>According to Huson, there will be four committee sessions spread out over three days with the opening ceremony introducing chairs, committees and a guest speaker. Each committee will have two topics for discussion and will be chaired by MUN students.</p>\n<p>Huson said MUN members can learn how to be better delegates through hosting a conference.</p>\n<p>“Conferences are super helpful because students are chairing and facilitating the debates,” Huson said. “Chairs who are members will see what makes people good delegates so when they go to travel conferences they can know how to better behave and win prizes and learn what goes into writing a good resolution.”</p>\n<p>MUN will host two more annual conferences, the Gaucho Model United Nations High School Conference and the Central Coast Scrimmage, on Feb. 14-15 and May 2 respectively.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58011\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/model-u-n-to-host-fifth-annual-conference-friday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58011\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/model-u-n-to-host-fifth-annual-conference-friday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/model-u-n-to-host-fifth-annual-conference-friday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/model-u-n-to-host-fifth-annual-conference-friday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/model-u-n-to-host-fifth-annual-conference-friday/","id":2306,"author":{"id":124,"name":"Josephine Niu"},"related":[2305,2304,2303],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stalker Reportedly Harassing Women After UCSB Lectures","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-03-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/policephoto.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/policephoto.jpg?resize=600%2C429&ssl=1","description":"The suspect has allegedly stalked and harassed multiple women in the past week.\r\n\r\n","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police are looking for a male UC Santa Barbara student who they say has stalked and harassed multiple women in the past week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suspect has asked women for their phone numbers after classes, the UCSB Police Department (UCPD) announced in a university alert. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the suspect feels ignored, he proceeds to harass the women, following them on social media, sending derogatory text and social media messages, and, in some cases, showing up at their residence,” the alert read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD is investigating the crime.

</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only 48 of the 714 teams that participated in O.R.C.S. earned bids to attend Nationals, according to Vice President Marlon Steven Poroj.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is the biggest accomplishment any team could achieve because of the high caliber of the Southern California area,” UCSB Mock Trial President and A team Captain Alexandria Suebert said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We compete against teams who have consistently placed highly at nationals and are highly concentrated within our area therefore to get a spot and be the second ranked team behind Stanford is phenomenal,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A team, which consists of Suebert, Co-Captain Blake Berich, Sudeep Dhanoa, Taylar Hender, Justine Jung, Jimmy McFeely, Marlon Steven Poroj, Kane Tenorio and Deborah Williams, is one of 48 teams that will travel to Minneapolis to compete in the National Championship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s B team did not receive a bid for Nationals. However, they have surpassed their previous records, as this is the first year that both teams have qualified for O.R.C.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact that we were able to qualify and be put on the same playing field as our A team and qualify alongside schools that don’t take us seriously really means a lot to me, coming in as an underdog,” B Captain and Secretary Zenia Safadi said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team is student-run and receives part-time assistance from a UCSB alum who acts as an attorney coach, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to Poroj.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That fact has been disadvantageous due to the huge time commitments, no attorney coaches, high tournament fees, and travel expenses,” Poroj said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though this is the team’s biggest accomplishment to date, they have been steadily increasing their status as a nationally known team. In 2014, the team took first place in the Yale University Invitational, and this past January they hosted Mocktopia, the second-largest tournament on the West Coast. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suebert praised her teammates for their motivation and persistence, a combination of which gives them “the Umph,” as the Executive Board calls it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though they are not sure of what to expect from their first-ever tournament, during which they will compete against teams from Harvard, Yale, Stanford and other Ivy League schools, Poroj believes that this is a defining moment in the team’s transformation as a team in it for fun, but also one that will “kick ass and take names.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since we have never made it to Nationals before, we do not know what to expect, but we do know that only the best of the best will be competing … so we are going to Minneapolis with guns blazing,” Treasurer Janice Espindola said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team has started a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/ucsb-mock-trial-nationals\">GoFundMe</a> to help pay for the trip to Nationals. </span></p>\n<p><i>Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the team did not have a coach.
