The class gained national attention during this time, and had a peak enrollment of nearly 900 students. The discussion panel featured Wilson, a Vietnam War veteran, Marty McGrath, a US Navy air traffic controller third class, Janice Summers, a US Navy Officer third class dental technician and Vietnam War veteran, Penny Turner, U.S. Army air defense artillery desert storm and Arlene Sandoval, a US Airforce senior airman and aerospace medical technician. Each gave an account of their experiences during and after their time of service.</p>\n<p>Representative Capps said many Vietnam War veterans were not treated fairly when they returned from service.</p>\n<p>“Some [veterans] hid up in the hills. There was no re-entry program. There was no phrase ‘post-traumatic stress disorder,’” Capps said. “They were alienated, disoriented, couldn’t talk to their families, couldn’t speak to anyone about it. So some fought back, some withdrew and it wasn’t healthy.”</p>\n<p>Capps said her husband Walter started teaching the course during a time of tension caused by the negative public reactions toward the war.</p>\n<p>“There was an era of time when he had to walk through smoke in Isla Vista to get to class. The Bank of America burned. It was wild. It was violent. The country tore itself apart over this war,” Capps said. “And who were the victims? The soldiers. The people who had nothing to do with causing it or the impact that it had on society.”</p>\n<p>McGrath is currently a volunteer at the Veterans Treatment Court in Santa Maria, California. She described the conditions of the veterans that typically come in for help and what she does for them.</p>\n<p>“They’re still suffering … they have serious problems, they encounter the law,” McGrath said. “Rather than go to jail and serve time for no constructive reason, Judge Flores created the Veterans treatment court … in that court we get to see the PTSD … Times have changed and they get professional assessment.”</p>\n<p>McGrath recounted her time in the service, saying, “Out of 12 years of Catholic School with the Irish nuns, going into boot camp was a piece of cake.”</p>\n<p>US Navy Officer and third class dental technician Janice Summers discussed the progress of veterans today and the support system established to help other veterans.</p>\n<p>“A lot of them [veterans] are actually giving back,” Summers said. “Yes, it was a terrible time. Yes, I was spit on. Even after the riots … even after our barracks got raided on … you have to move forward. If you have a situation, you can never let it get the best of you.”</p>\n<p>Turner said veterans need the help of the public and of those around them to overcome their traumatic experiences.</p>\n<p>“I ask you to remember us and to help support us — not financially, because most of us don’t want nothing. There’s nothing you can give me,” Turner said. “But to support us with love, dignity and compassion that we’re entitled to, that we picked up arms to do for you.”</p>\n<p>Veteran Wilson said he still suffered as a veteran of the Vietnam War through a form of unique cancer caused by exposure to the warfare herbicide, Agent Orange.</p>\n<p>“I was killed in Vietnam, I just haven’t fallen yet,” Wilson said.</p>\n<p>At the end of the discussion, Representative Capps was given a coin in celebration of American women in military service.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68333\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/lois-capps-veterans-lecture-on-condition-of-vietnam-war-veterans/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68333\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/lois-capps-veterans-lecture-on-condition-of-vietnam-war-veterans/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/lois-capps-veterans-lecture-on-condition-of-vietnam-war-veterans/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/lois-capps-veterans-lecture-on-condition-of-vietnam-war-veterans/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/lois-capps-veterans-lecture-on-condition-of-vietnam-war-veterans/","id":2530,"author":{"id":35,"name":"Sonia May Htoon"},"related":[2529,2528,2527],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":35,"name":"Sonia May Htoon","biography":"Not available","articles":[2530,2667,2692,3761,3867,3985,4608],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"College Republicans and UCSB for Bernie Hold Debate","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Debate_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Debate_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"More than 80 students filled the Flying A room of the UCEN Tuesday to attend a formal debate between representatives from College Republicans and UCSB for Bernie.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>More than 80 students filled the Flying A room of the UCEN Tuesday to attend a formal debate between representatives from College Republicans and UCSB for Bernie.</p>\n<p>After months of negotiations, the two groups, each represented by two debaters, held an event to discuss the feasibility of a higher minimum wage and tuition-free public college.

id=\"caption-attachment-68326\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Andrew Gates, second-year economics and accounting major and member of College Republicans, began the debate by questioning the demographics of minimum wage workers.</p>\n<p>“This popular belief that minimum wage workers are low-income adults working 40 plus hours a week to fend for their families and children is simply not true,” Gates said. “In actuality, only about 4.7 percent of minimum wage workers are low-income adults providing for their families.”</p>\n<p>Gates then cited the U.S. Department of Labor to claim minimum wage has negative effects on the economy and employment.</p>\n<p>“The US Department of Labor’s own assessment of the first minimum wage — this was commissioned by FDR — found that it resulted in job losses for 30,000 to 50,000 workers,” Gates said. “That’s 10 to 15 percent of the 300,000 workers who previously earned below that.”</p>\n<p>Eric Villalobos, third-year religious studies major and head organizer of UCSB for Bernie, argued in favor of a minimum wage increase.</p>\n<p>“A 2013 study by the Chicago Fed [Chicago Federal Reserve] found that increasing the minimum wage even just to $9 an hour would increase consumer spending by $28 billion,” Villalobos said. “It frees up money from the employer and from the business and makes it goes into the lower wage workers’ pockets.”</p>\n<p>Villalobos said raising the minimum wage can lead to an increase in employment.</p>\n<p>“So far there is no evidence that raising the minimum wage causes an increase in unemployment or job loss,” Villalobos said. “In fact, in a Goldman-Sachs analysis of 13 states which have raised their minimum wage, it found that states where minimum wage went up had faster employment growth than states where the minimum wage remained at its 2013 level.”</p>\n<p>Ron Papile, third-year economics major and executive director of College Republicans, responded to Villalobos’ claim by citing studies on labor and the food industry that show prices rise with wages.</p>\n<p>“A 2007 study from the federal reserve bank of Chicago found that restaurant prices unambiguously increased in response to minimum wage,” Papile said. “Furthermore, a study by the German Institute for the Study of Labor found that, especially in fast food restaurants, roughly two-thirds of the minimum wage increase would actually lead to price increases.”</p>\n<p>Papile then discussed price increases in fast food restaurants.</p>\n<p>“Think about something like McDonald’s or Taco Bell, where you have a product that costs only $1 to buy – a $1 burger or taco,” Papile said. “The only reason that the prices are so low is because they’re matching the benefits they can get to the cost of creating the products.”</p>\n<p>Guy Singer, third-year biopsychology major and co-chair of UCSB for Bernie, had the last word on the issue of minimum wage.</p>\n<p>“600 of the nation’s most prolific economists authored a collective letter in 2014 supporting the notion that reasonable minimum wage increases had little or no effect on employment,” Singer said. “Even from the small business owner’s perspective there’s quite a tight consensus on raising the minimum wage.”</p>\n<p>The debate then shifted to the issue of whether or not public universities should be tuition free.</p>\n<p>Villalobos began by arguing that free tuition is not a new concept and has been implemented in many countries.</p>\n<p>“The campaign would like to argue that this is not a radical idea; last year Germany eliminated tuition because they believed that charging students $1,300 dollars per year was discouraging Germans from going to college,” Villalobos said. “Next year Chile will do the same, as will Finland, Norway, Sweden and many other countries around the world.”</p>\n<p>Villalobos then discussed democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ plan to address student loans.</p>\n<p>“The formula for setting student loan interest rates would go back to where it was in 2006,” Villalobos said. “If this plan were in effect today interest rates on undergrad loans would drop from 4.29 percent to just 2.37 percent.”</p>\n<p>Gates said government subsidies would actually increase the cost of tuitions.</p>\n<p>“As government subsidizes tuition, the cost of tuition increases proportionately,” Gates said. “The federal reserve bank of New York found that tuition and fees increased in proportion to the number of eligible students.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68325\"

subsequent crash.</p>\n<p>“In 1995 when the government subsidized mortgage loans, banks began loaning indiscriminately knowing that the government would cover it, increasing demand for housing and driving up prices of homes,” Gates said. “As government subsidizes, tuitions are hiked because colleges have no incentive to reign in that cost of tuition.”</p>\n<p>Singer responded by saying capable students should have the right to attend the colleges of their choice, regardless of income.</p>\n<p>“If you get accepted you should have the right to go to that university regardless of how much money your parents make,” Singer said. “The way we lose scientists and technological advancement is by selecting who gets to go university based on income.”</p>\n<p>Singer then defended the idea of socialism in public education.</p>\n<p>“A hundred years ago completely subsidized public high schools were called socialist, 300 years ago completely subsidized public elementary schools were called socialist, and now they say completely subsidized higher education is socialist,” Singer said. “How many times do we have to go through the process before we figure out that socialism isn’t a scary word?”</p>\n<p>Papile said the large increase in students at universities would negatively impact the ability of students to take impacted classes.</p>\n<p>“Graduating with a bachelor’s degree in six years is actually about 59 percent of students, which to me is a very shocking statistic and shows how impacted classes currently are and how difficult it is to get them,” Papile said. “If we flood colleges with more students, it’s only going to make classes harder to get into.”</p>\n<p>Papile also said private universities would be unable to compete with public universities if public university tuition was free.</p>\n<p>“How are private universities going to compete with public universities if public universities are going to offer free tuition,” Papile said.</p>\n<p>Emily Anne Williams, a first-year linguistics major, said she thought the debaters were well-informed and prepared.</p>\n<p>“I think both sides did very well,” Williams said. “I heard a lot of statistics thrown around, which I think most college students don’t know about, and it was nice to see four people who actually did research.”</p>\n<p>Daniel Reardon, third-year physics and philosophy double major and president of College Republicans, said he was happy with how the speakers handled the debate.</p>\n<p>“I was very pleasantly surprised and, honestly, there aren’t many ways it could have gone better,” Reardon said. “Nobody couldn’t answer a question, everyone was very well informed on the topic and I’m happy with how it went for both sides.”</p>\n<p>Emily Humpal, a third-year political science major, said she thought having the two clubs debate was beneficial for the student community.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s great that we have the two clubs coming together because we don’t have a lot of students active in the political arena,” Humpal said. “These issues affect us, and I think a lot more people need to know that.”</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: An initial version of this article listed the name of College Republicans’ executive director as Ron Kapeel, when his actual name is Ron Papile. Also, the article states the debate addressed whether the federal minimum wage should be raised from $7.25 to $15.00 over the next 8 years. However, the topic was an increase over several year, not 8 specifically.</em><em>]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68335\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/college-republicans-and-ucsb-for-bernie-hold-debate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68335\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/college-republicans-and-ucsb-for-bernie-hold-debate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/college-republicans-and-ucsb-for-bernie-hold-debate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/college-republicans-and-ucsb-for-bernie-hold-debate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/college-republicans-and-ucsb-for-bernie-hold-debate/","id":2529,"author":{"id":114,"name":"Hubert Zhang"},"related":[2528,2527,2526],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

It does say in the constitution that all students have the right to vote in the election,” Hashemian said. “There is no precedent to this and there’s no policy at all, in a sense it could be argued that it comes down to whatever the Senate decides.”</p>\n<p>However, Hashemian said students could separately present the issue to A.S. Judicial Affairs and the A.S. Elections Committee. If a student petition were to be created, Hashemian said the Elections Board would have “full jurisdiction” in taking further action.</p>\n<p>Miles Ashlock, assistant dean and director of the Office of Student Life, received a copy of the letter Gonzalez sent to the Elections Board.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I completely agree with everything he said, I was a witness to the conversation and he is representing the situation very honestly,” Ashlock said.</span></p>\n<p>The A.S. Elections Board believes the alleged bribery “skewed the results” of the A.S. elections and demonstrated that “members of the IFC decided that certain votes meant more than others.”</p>\n<p>“UCSB consists of over 900 organizations and not every organization has access to such funding to offer incentives to their members,” the document states. “IFC’s actions posed a threat to the conduct of fair elections and if no action is taken in regards to this situation, it would be perpetuating the belief that votes can be bought and sold.”</p>\n<p>The A.S. Senate will meet tomorrow at 6:30 p.m. in Corwin Pavilion during their weekly meeting for further discussion.</p>\n<p>*Update 4:49 p.m. — The A.S.

A.S. Executive Director Maricela Marquez also spoke briefly about concerns surrounding last November’s Mac DeMarco concert, during which police apprehended the artist after he climbed the rafters of The Hub.</p>\n<p>Marquez announced efforts to establish better communication between UC Police Department and the A.S. Program Board, which put on the concert, in order to prevent future mistakes on the part of security personnel including the chief of police for UCPD and Program Board officials.</p>\n<p>“We sent a general memo to all those personnel to see if we could do some cross-training about how things work and what impact one of our decisions make on others and so on and so forth,” Marquez said.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy was present at the meeting to inform the Senate about a possible I.V. rebranding project and potential university-sponsored events to be held during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>Guthy questioned whether a rebranding campaign is necessary and if money raised for such a campaign could be better spent on investing in certain I.V. programs.</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, I.V.S.A.F.E., a committee on I.V. safety led Santa Barbara District Attorney Joyce Dudley, is currently working on a rebranding initiative for I.V.</p>\n<p>“Today they proposed that this campaign would cost somewhere in the realm of $90,000 so they’re looking into where they would get those sources of funding,” Guthy said, “I expressed concern over whether students would rather see that money going toward actually creating programs to benefit I.V. rather than tell the world that it is better. So we’re not really sure where we will be going with that.”</p>\n<p>Guthy also said university administration is examining potential alternative entertainment programming, similar to what was held during Halloween, for this year’s Deltopia, an event typically held the first weekend of Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p>“The university has reserved a lot of campus venues like Harder Stadium and Campbell Hall for alternative programming that weekend and I think A.S. Program Board is looking into hosting some sort of concert or alternative event similar to Halloween,” Guthy said. “Nothing’s been set yet but plans have been developed.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Vice President of Local Affairs Cameron Schunk said he encouraged off-campus senators to attend town hall meetings organized by California State Assemblyman for Santa Barbara Das Williams, to discuss efforts toward I.V. self-governance. Schunk also said the first of these meetings for Winter Quarter is scheduled to take place Feb. 5, followed by subsequent meetings on the Feb. 15 and March 5.</p>\n<p>Schunk also said he would like to see expanded service offering by the A.S. Pardall Center, including the purchase of its current building, which A.S. leases, to create a more permanent A.S. presence in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I would like to look into the idea of the Associated Students being able to increase and expand the services provided in the Pardall Center, specifically through an increase in fee initiative,” Schunk said. “One of the main things we would be looking to do is provide the opportunity for the Associated Students to also use that funding in the long term to perhaps purchase that building so that we no longer have to worry about renting that space.”</p>\n<p>The Senate also passed its only action item of the week, “A Resolution to Support Wage Equality Among UC Employees” without objection, which voices the Senate’s support for equal salaries for staff regardless of gender.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appears on page 4 of the Thursday, January 8, 2015 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59474\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/a-s-senate-passes-salary-resolution-talks-safety-in-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59474\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/a-s-senate-passes-salary-resolution-talks-safety-in-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/a-s-senate-passes-salary-resolution-talks-safety-in-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/a-s-senate-passes-salary-resolution-talks-safety-in-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/a-s-senate-passes-salary-resolution-talks-safety-in-i-v/","id":2527,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2526,2525,2524],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
