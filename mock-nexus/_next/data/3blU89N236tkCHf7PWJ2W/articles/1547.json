The Aztecs come into the weekend with an impressive 5-2-0 record while the Bulldogs enter at 2-4-1 overall.</p>\n<p>“The key for us is to be able to build on what we did Saturday night, the good things that we did,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Going into this weekend, the emphasis for us as a team is to continue to play well from the 18-yard box to the 18-yard box, but we have to be able to eliminate that one mistake and somebody has to score for us. It’s a big weekend for us before we get going in the league.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Up first for Santa Barbara will be San Diego State on Friday. Despite the Aztecs’ hot start to the season, home-field advantage may prove to be an important factor as all five of their wins this year have come at home.</p>\n<p>“San Diego State is kind of a scrappy team. They won’t really make 10, 15 passes in a row,” sophomore goalkeeper Josh McNeely said. “I think they’re just going to try to sit behind the ball and capitalize on one of our mistakes, but that’s where we have to do better and keep it tight in the back.”</p>\n<p>San Diego’s offense is powered by forward David Olsen, who has scored a team-high five goals in seven starts. The 6’0” freshman is complemented on the attacking front by sophomore forward Forrayah Bass, who has accumulated three goals and four assists in only five starts this season.</p>\n<p>“[The Aztecs] have some good players up front that’ve been scoring a lot of goals,” Vom Steeg said. “I think it’s a dangerous attacking team, but they’ve also been giving up goals.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos did just hold the No. 1 team in the nation to a single goal last weekend, they have had some early season defensive struggles, most notably in giving up three goals to No. 22 Furman and four to No. 19 Stanford in previous weeks.</p>\n<p>“This is one of those games where I think it’s a good opportunity for us to take advantage of a defense that maybe isn’t as good as UCLA’s, but obviously we haven’t gotten a shutout this year,” Vom Steeg said. “We have a lot to do defensively to make sure that we start getting shutouts.”</p>\n<p>On Sunday, Drake will come to town looking to build on its recent 1-0 win over UMKC. The Bulldogs, who are currently averaging just over one goal per game as a team, have had their own share of defensive struggles this season, giving up 11 scores in just seven games.</p>\n<p>“The thing about Drake is that they’re a very disciplined team. They play basically a 4-5-1, they’re very organized,” Vom Steeg sad. “It’s a team that in the past we’ve struggled to find goals against, so hopefully we can find some goals on Friday night and have that lead into Sunday.”</p>\n<p>A point of emphasis for UCSB this weekend will be its offensive presence, especially after a solid defensive outing against UCLA was essentially wasted due to its inability to score a goal. So far, the team total of eight goals has been equally spread between eight different players.</p>\n<p>“Offensively, it’s not just scoring goals, we need to be more dangerous,” Vom Steeg said. “We need to be able to get more coming off the amount of times we’re on the ball.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos know they won’t necessarily be able to control how many goals they score or concede, what they must control is their mental game. Mental lapses on the defense have been costly at times this season, and the importance of every moment on the field will only grow when Big West play begins next week.</p>\n<p>“We have these little 10-minute lapses where we either lose focus or are under a bit of pressure, which is normal for soccer games. We just have to really stay focused for those 10 minutes,” McNeely said. “[The key] is just going to be staying focused for a full 90 minutes, improving on our defensive errors, and really staying focused in those ten-minute lapses.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff against San Diego State is set for 7:00 p.m. this Friday, while the game against Drake is scheduled for 6:00 p.m. on Sunday.</p>\n<p>A version of

Davis enters the weekend in that same three-way tie at 2-1-1 Big West and 4-1-8 overall.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We need to move on from this last week in general,” sophomore left back Drew Murphy said. “If we can get that out of our system and believe again, we should be winning these games.”</p>\n<p>Things seemed to be going perfect for the Gauchos at the beginning of the Big West season, but they have failed to win a game since their upset win over No. 5 UC Irvine almost two weeks ago.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s disappointing results lately have been attributed to several issues. When the Gauchos have played away from home, opposing teams have flustered them with gameplans centered around sending hopeful long balls into the box, substituting constantly and fouling to keep them from trapping and passing the way they want to.</p>\n<p>“Our record on the road is not good enough. We need to learn how to win ugly and not just win pretty like we do at home,” Murphy said. “As a team we need to figure it out and we need to figure it out quick.”</p>\n<p>The most impactful issue for UCSB, though, has been the utter decimation of its defense.</p>\n<p>Key defensive starters in Murphy and senior right back Kevin-Garcia Lopez have been hampered by injuries, with Garcia-Lopez slated to miss the next two weeks. Sophomore captain Paul Ehmann has officially left the team to return to Germany, leaving a gaping hole for the Gauchos to fill in their back line. Additionally, freshman Jeff Quezada and junior Dylan Murphy missed over a full game each after being red carded two games ago.</p>\n<p>“It’s been kind of crazy the last couple weeks with Paul leaving and suspensions and injuries, but at the end of the day it’s not acceptable to be bleeding goals like we have been,” Murphy said. “It’s on us to step up and take ownership. It’s not a problem that’s solved overnight but we’ve got to figure it out quick.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ current streak of three straight without a win has been accompanied by their worst offensive slump this year, with the team having scored just one goal during that stretch. Ending that slump could be difficult this weekend against the Big West’s number one defense in Davis, which gives up just 0.60 goals per game to opposing teams. To make matters worse, leading goal scorer sophomore forward Nick DePuy will miss the game due to yellow card accumulation after being booked for the fifth time this season against LMU on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>“We have to defend better. We have to find somebody on the field that can find us a goal,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “It’s the same thing that we did when we won four games in a row. Again, right now, it’s all about our defense.”</p>\n<p>Luckily for UCSB, Davis has struggled recently, mirroring the Gauchos with just one goal in its last three outings. Junior midfielder Lucas Mohageg leads the way with three goals, but the Aggies have not been particularly dangerous on offense all season, averaging just one goal per game as a team.</p>\n<p>“Davis is a tough place to play and it’s not a very pretty game. We’ve just got to instill some self-belief again and go along those lines,” Murphy said. “It’s not about the opponent, it’s all within ourselves at the moment.”</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos can find a way to win against Davis, it would be their first Big West road win since they defeated the same Aggies last October in a thrilling 3-2 double overtime victory. However, according to Vom Steeg, they will need to stay strong mentally in order to overcome the recent setbacks that have plagued them.</p>\n<p>“To win on the road you have to have the right mentality,” Vom Steeg said. “Do I feel like we still have a more talented team than, say, UC Davis? Sure. But you’ve got to have the right mentality to win a game like that.”</p>\n<p>The game is set to kickoff at 3:00 p.m. this Saturday at Aggie Soccer Field.</p><div

Tournament and a first-round bye with this past Sunday’s win at Cal Poly, the UCSB men’s soccer team plays its final regular season game today against Sacramento State.</p>\n<p>At 9-6-3 overall, and with the best record in the conference at 5-2-2, the Gauchos enter today’s matchup knowing that it is little more than a final tune-up before they host the Big West Semi Finals next Wednesday. The Hornets, meanwhile, have surprisingly jumped over Cal Poly in the standings thanks to a timely two-game winning streak and currently own the final playoff spot in the Big West North Division. At 6-9-3 overall and 4-4-1 in the Big West, Sac State can clinch a playoff berth with a win over UCSB.</p>\n<p>Ever since their season’s longest road trip of four games ended just over two weeks ago, the Gauchos have been one of the hottest teams in the country. In their last four games alone, they have been outstanding on both sides of the ball, outscoring opponents 9-3 on their way to a 3-0-1 record.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>One of the big reasons for their recent form has been sophomore forward Nick DePuy, who was just named College Soccer News’ National Player of the Week for the second time this season after scoring three goals, including two game-winners, against UC Davis and Cal Poly this past week.</p>\n<p>DePuy also tallied a Big West single-game high of nine shots against the Aggies last Wednesday. With eight goals this year, he has at least twice as many goals as any other Gaucho and ranks second in the conference.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Ludwig Ahl has also been in fine form in recent games, hooking up with DePuy for two assists in the team’s road win against Cal Poly. Totaling four goals and four assists this season, Ahl has the second most offensive points on his team with 12.</p>\n<p>Additionally, sophomores Drew Murphy and Ismaila Jome have each tallied five assists on the year, putting both of them in a tie for number one in the Big West.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos finally got off the mark on Sunday with their first conference road win of 2014, they can now rest easy knowing that the Big West Tournament will have to come through Harder Stadium. UCSB has been nearly unbeatable at home this season, going 7-1-2 at Harder compared to 2-4-2 in all other games.</p>\n<p>Despite Wednesday’s game with Sac State being a no-bearing game for the Gauchos, they will likely have no intentions of taking their foot off the gas pedal. The Hornets are powered offensively by senior forward Chimdum Mez, who has a team-high seven goals this season.</p>\n<p>As a team, Sac State is the hottest it has been all season, having won each of its last two games in hostile road environments. With Saturday’s remarkable overtime win over UC Davis, one of the top defenses in the nation, the Hornets tied a season-high with three goals, including two from sophomore defender Andrew Gosselin. They are also on a season-high two-game winning streak within which they have scored five goals, their most in a two-game span this year.</p>\n<p>Once UCSB finishes its season against Sac State, it will then wait to play the Quarterfinal winner between the second seed in the South and the third seed in the North next Wednesday at home.</p>\n<p>The match with the Hornets will begin at 2:00 p.m. today at Hornet Soccer Field.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

the Gauchos win against UC Davis in overtime on Wednesday night.  Kenneth<em> Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>With just two games remaining in the season, the UCSB men’s soccer team travels to Cal Poly this Sunday for a game that will have huge playoff implications for both teams.</p>\n<p>Coming off of a huge home win over UC Davis this past Wednesday, the Gauchos find themselves in great shape in the Big West. They are currently tied for first place in the North Division with the Aggies at 6-2-9 overall and 4-2-2 in the conference. The Mustangs will look to bounce back after their current three-game winless streak dropped them to third place in the North at 8-5-4 overall, 3-3-2 Big West.</p>\n<p>“Against Cal Poly on Sunday, on that field with 10,000 people in the stands, you have to be really composed,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Nine of our players have never experienced playing at Cal Poly, so we’re going to have to hopefully play like we did [against Davis], put some things together and just find a way to go get ourselves that one road win.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Things haven’t gone too smoothly for the Gauchos when they’ve played away from Harder Stadium this season, as they have gone 0-1-2 in conference road games this season. If they are going to be able to finish in first place though, they will need to find a way to win at least one of their final two on the road.</p>\n<p>“Obviously what’s critical for us is we’re not really good on the road right now,” Vom Steeg said. “We have to now try to figure out how to win on the road and we might as well learn how to do that sooner rather than later.”</p>\n<p>The Mustangs, who find themselves in a less than ideal position just one point ahead of Sacramento State for the final playoff spot in the North, will be looking for revenge after they let a 2-0 lead slip away against UCSB last Saturday. After a pair of second-half goals by freshman and sophomore forwards Ludwig Ahl and Nick DePuy tied the game for the Gauchos, a game-winning goal seemed like it could come at any moment.</p>\n<p>Despite having three times as many shots as Cal Poly through two overtimes, Santa Barbara failed to find the back of the net for a third time, ending the game in a 2-2 draw.</p>\n<p>“We outshot Cal Poly 30-10 in that game, so maybe if we can put a couple of those away and fix a couple of mistakes we can come away with a win,” Vom Steeg said. “The big question mark up there is how we handle the environment. We’ll have to go into the freak show on Sunday and figure out a way to go get something up there, and that’s always an experience.”</p>\n<p>A win would certainly strengthen the Gauchos’ chances of getting first place in the division and subsequently winning home-field advantage for the tournament. Having gone undefeated at home in conference play at 4-2-2, one of their top priorities is clearly going to be earning that first seed heading into the postseason.</p>\n<p>“Finishing in first place means that we get a couple home games in the Big West Tournament, and that’s our best chance of winning it,” Vom Steeg said. “I like us against anybody here at Harder Stadium, so that’s really what we’re fighting for.”</p>\n<p>A vulnerable UCSB defense looked very good against Davis on Wednesday, giving the Gauchos their third shutout of the season despite pushing players up the field for most of the second half and overtime. However, this weekend UCSB will be going up against the top offense in the Big West, which leads the conference in both goals (28) and shooting percentage (.123).</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, their offensive attack will continue to be run through DePuy and sophomore Ismaila Jome down the left wing. DePuy’s team-high of six goals is good for placing fifth in the conference, while Jome’s five assists has him tied with sophomore midfielder and teammate Drew Murphy for first in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“It’s a great opportunity for a young team to have to go figure out 16 to 17 games into the season whether or not we can find a way to win on the road,” Vom Steeg said. “I thought we got a great result with our tie at Cal Poly last year, but we’re hoping to obviously go out there and win.”</p>\n<p>The game will begin at 5:00 p.m. this Sunday at Alex G. Spanos Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57698\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/blue-green-rematch/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57698\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/blue-green-rematch/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/blue-green-rematch/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/blue-green-rematch/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/blue-green-rematch/","id":1544,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1543,1542,1541],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
