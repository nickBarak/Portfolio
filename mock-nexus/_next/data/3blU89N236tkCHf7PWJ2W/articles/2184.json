Campus Democrats focused on registering voters and getting out the vote, while College Republicans created spaces for discussion and informed students of the issues.</p>\n<p>Both groups have been actively canvassing for their respective endorsed candidates.</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats has devoted efforts to register voters, according to Campus Democrats President Aisha Khan.</p>\n<p>“Preparing for midterms is [about] maintaining that focus we’ve had since our beginning to educate young people about politics, politics locally, how they can get involved and why it’s important,” Khan, a third-year political science major, said.</p>\n<p>Since January 2018, Khan said Campus Democrats has registered 9,513 voters in the Isla Vista and UCSB communities.</p>\n<p>This includes the concentrated registration efforts during UCSB’s winter and spring quarters for the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/\">Measure R campaign</a>.</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats members tabled in the Arbor and the University Center almost every day from the beginning of the 2018-19 school year to register voters, Khan said.</p>\n<p>They also had stations around campus and I.V. on Oct. 22, the last day to register.</p>\n<p>College Republicans does not focus on registering voters and instead focuses on providing an open forum for discussion to students about the issues and candidates, according to College Republicans President Leslie Garcia.</p>\n<p>“In the past, we’ve hosted events for people to watch the presidential debates and the Republican candidate debates,” Garcia, a fourth-year Middle East studies and political science double major, said.</p>\n<p>“I think that the purpose of our [organization] is to create a space for discourse which isn’t really found on campus.”</p>\n<p>In addition to open general meetings, College Republicans hold public forum events throughout the year, such as the event held in the Hub on Oct. 24.</p>\n<p>The organization also holds speaking events and often dedicates large portions of time during those events for debate and questions.</p>\n<p>“Becoming engaged in a space where you are capable and there is an opportunity for you to debate your positions, that really does tend to [make] people [want] to be more knowledgeable and more involved in the political sphere,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>In addition to creating spaces for students to discuss and learn more about politics, both organizations have been canvassing for candidates aligned with their respective views.</p>\n<p>“One way that we have remained involved in the [upcoming] midterm elections is canvassing for Justin Fareed,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>Fareed is a Republican Congressional candidate in the 24th congressional district. The district is currently represented by Salud Carbajal, who is endorsed by the Campus Democrats.</p>\n<p>The organization has been knocking on doors and speaking to voters in Goleta and Santa Maria leading up to the election.</p>\n<p>“We’ve also gotten involved with the No On Prop 10 campaign, so we’ve been making phone calls for them about two or three times a week, about five of our members each time,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>California Proposition 10 would repeal the <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1506\">Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act</a>, a state law enacted in 1995 that places limitations on the power of city governments to control rent.</p>\n<p>Now that voter registration has ended, Campus Democrats has also doubled down on campaigning for local candidates and issues.</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats “has been a volunteer for local Democratic campaigns” since its inception. The organization also has close ties with the campaigns of incumbent congressman Salud Carbajal and incumbent assemblywoman Monique Limón, according to Khan.</p>\n<p>“It’s about emphasizing the importance of local politics and the power that we have here locally,” Khan said.</p>\n<p>The organization has been canvassing for its slate of endorsed candidates as well as the passing of Measure G and California Proposition 10 by calling voters and going door-to-door in Santa Barbara, Isla Vista and Goleta.</p>\n<p>“People get exposure to what it’s like [to work on] on a real political campaign,” Khan said.</p>\n<p>Khan and Garcia both emphasized the importance of students exercising their right to vote.</p>\n<p>Garcia highlighted the importance of educated and informed voting as a key mission of College Republicans.</p>\n<p>She noted the influence of the political climate on conversations about the election with community members.</p>\n<p>“I think the majority of students are left-leaning, but I don’t think they’re so left-leaning that they’re completely shut down to discourse,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>“In the past year or two, there have been a lot of situations on campuses where events are shut down and students are harassed or assaulted because they are putting their political opinions out there. I don’t think that’s a thing that really happens here at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>She said she believes elections such as the midterms can be overwhelming for first-time voters and individuals new to the U.S. political sphere.</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats also keeps the age of its intended audience in mind, and the organization’s main goal is “to educate and empower young people about politics,” according to Khan.</p>\n<p>“For a lot of us, we are really new to politics so it’s a unique opportunity to have a very powerful voice and [change] something when you are brand new to it,” Khan said.</p>\n<p>“There are not that many places in the country where young people’s votes are concentrated in an area and Isla Vista is one of those places. It makes a really big difference locally.”</p>\n<p><em>The 2018 midterm elections are on Tuesday, Nov. 6.

href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-04/abortion-pills-may-be-available-to-california-college-students-with-passage-of-bill/\">Senate Bill 320</a>, in Feb. 2017. SB 320 would have required all University of California and California State University campuses to offer medication abortion services by Jan. 1, 2022.</p>\n<p>However, Governor Jerry Brown <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-09-30/governor-brown-vetoes-abortion-pill-bill/\">vetoed Senate Bill 320</a> on Sept. 30.</p>\n<p>This new bill, <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB24\">Senate Bill 24</a> – colloquially known as the “College Student Right to Access Act” – would require public universities with on-campus student health centers to provide medication abortion to students who seek to terminate their pregnancy during the first 10 weeks.</p>\n<p>“It is critically important that we reaffirm the constitutional right of college students to access abortion care without delay, and that should always include student health centers on public university campuses,” Levya said in a press release sent out on Dec. 3.</p>\n<p>“Regardless of where they may live, Californians should have access to the full range and choices of reproductive care services so that they can plan their futures and accomplish their goals.”</p>\n<p>Research shows medication abortion has a success rate of over 95 percent, according to the press release. Serious adverse events occur in only 0.3 percent of instances.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/abortion-pill-clears-hurdle-on-path-to-public-universities/\"><em>Nexus</em> previously reported</a> that the National Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), a non-partisan council, released a report on March 16 confirming the Mifeprex pill, a hormonal pill used for medical abortions, is safe and effective.</p>\n<p>SB 24 is sponsored by the Women’s Foundation of California, ACLU California and Students United for Reproductive Justice at UC Berkeley, among others, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>“I am confident that the incoming Legislature will also approve SB 24 and that Governor-Elect Gavin Newsom will continue to stand strong in his support for a woman’s right to choose,” Levya said.</p>\n<p>SB 24 will be “considered in Senate policy committee(s) later this spring,” according to the press release.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

id=\"caption-attachment-84795\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tri Delta has been a chapter at UCSB for 31 years. <em>Nick Song / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“A great deal of care and consideration went into this difficult decision,” Tri Delta’s national president, Kimberlee Di Fede Sullivan, said in an email sent out to members of the sorority Friday morning.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately, it was made by the Executive Board, in concert with Gamma Theta’s chapter volunteers and Executive Office staff, with heavy hearts for all involved.”</p>\n<p>Sullivan cited a decline in membership numbers as the reason for shuttering operations.</p>\n<p>“Despite the hard work and dedication of the chapter and the continual support of volunteers and staff, Gamma Theta has not achieved quota since 2012 and currently remains significantly below total,” Sullivan said.</p>\n<p>According to the email, the suspension will last for a minimum of four years, but the chapter hopes to return “at a time that is mutually beneficial for Tri Delta and the university.”</p>\n<p>New members will be offered the option of becoming a sister but would be an unaffiliated collegiate member – an alumnus of the sorority – after June 14, 2019. New members are also allowed to join another sorority at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Students currently living in the house will continue to have housing for the rest of the academic year. All members will retain their membership privileges for the duration of the academic year if they uphold their financial and membership expectations.</p>\n<p>Tri Delta President Sarah Kinane did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Nov. 7, 6:03 p.m.]: This article was updated to include information about Kinane.  </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

separate position.</p>\n<p>Loudon, a third-year history of public policy major, ran on a platform of lowering tuition, expanding sexual assault resources and advocating for students and workers with disabilities, according to Loudon’s Facebook page.</p>\n<p>The board briefly considered halving the threshold, but decided against it after agreeing that “the pre-determined voter threshold is not modifiable while the election is already in place,” Renteria said in a statement sent out Sunday.</p>\n<p>“It is important to note that the Elections Board only rules on the Elections process. We cannot and do not make any considerations based on who the candidate(s) is/are, the qualifications of the candidate(s) or the position(s) that are vacant,” he added.</p>\n<p>The position was left vacant following the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualification</a> of EVPSA-elect Mayela Morales during Spring Quarter.
