Speakers at the recital included Margo Halsted, former UCSB university carillonist; John Majewski, UCSB dean of humanities and fine arts and Nick Masuda, director of news at the Santa Barbara News-Press.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The structure and the instrument resting within the tower were both gifts from the late Thomas M. Storke, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and owner of the Santa Barbara News-Press for 32 years. During the dedication ceremony on Sept. 28, 1969, he stated: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is my hope that the publications coming from this building will be the finest examples of journalism developed on any campus in America — perhaps in the world.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the five decades since, the KCSB-FM radio station, La Cumbre yearbook and the Daily Nexus have made their homes at the base of the tower.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honoring this amount of history was no small task. According to Arai, almost a year was spent preparing for the semicentennial: “The thing that took the longest was to work with the two composers we commissioned to write new pieces for the event. I would say the resulting two pieces are one of the major successes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Golden Sounds,” by UCSB Professor Emeritus Emma Lou Diemer, was one of those pieces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I sat at the piano and held down the sustaining pedal to simulate the prolonged sounds of the carillon,” she wrote in an email, “and proceeded to write a piece that incorporated three different melodic elements and other musical ideas that are effective on the carillon.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second piece was “Fantasy on FIAT LUX” by world-renowned composer Aaron David Miller, which featured variations on the university motto “Fiat Lux” by the late Carl Zytowski, who was a UCSB professor of Music music for 44 years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Each letter of the motto spells out a musical theme which became the compositional material for the fantasy,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additional pieces included “Piece Without Expression No. 1” by Frank Percival Price, “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring” by Johann Sebastian Bach and “Fandango” by Ronald Barnes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The instrument that made all of these performances possible was the carillon atop Storke Tower, which contains 61 bells and is one of only six such installations in California. It is played with fists and feet that strike a set of wooden keys each corresponding to a specific bell: the heavier the strike, the louder the sound.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The largest, lowest bells weigh up to 2.5 tons, while the smallest, highest ones can weigh as little as 13 pounds, so you need to be careful with the balance and not let the low bells totally bury the high bells,” Arai said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In principle, this is not too different from how someone would play a piano or an organ, but the similarities end there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes there’s a bit of trial and error, where something I arrange just ends up being impossible to play or doesn’t sound good on the bells and I need to rework it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these challenges, Arai, Diemer and Miller all agreed that the experience of playing a carillon is worth the learning curve, especially given the sweeping view of campus and the Pacific Ocean from atop Storke Tower.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is good to see and hear beyond and within one’s self,” Diemer wrote, and “it’s fun and exciting to create sounds with those 61 bells.” Miller invoked the concept of fun as well, writing that “I don’t know of another instrument you work up a sweat while playing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You’re by yourself, high up in the tower when you play, far away from any listeners,” and “at least for me, this can actually make performing somewhat relaxing, unlike if you were performing on a stage where you can see your audience staring at you,” Arai added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, more than the performance itself, and true to Storke Tower’s tradition of learning and community expression, passing on the knowledge of the carillon is the best perk that comes with playing it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a bit more than just ringing the bells,” Arai said. Every quarter, he trains three students on how to play the carillon. “I think this is the most rewarding part, getting to work with enthusiastic, talented students and teaching them this very unique art.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diemer agreed. “It all comes together sometimes: people, music, memories, creating, learning, never giving up, using one’s talents and perfecting them as much as possible, cherishing the marvelous gift of life, being thankful for all of that. But learning is probably the most important. Isla Vista is full of people who are doing just that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the event may be over, the celebration and education continue.

Essentially, the Clippers season was over when the news broke that Chris Paul and Blake Griffin were out the rest of the series.</p>\n<p>No one had any hopes of them salvaging the series and no one believed Rivers could actually make a difference.</p>\n<p>Austin has had a difficult time earning respect in the NBA. As the former 10<sup>th</sup> overall pick, he displayed one of the worst rookie seasons by any lottery pick. The former Blue Devil was laughed at even more when his dad — Clippers Head Coach Doc Rivers — traded for him.</p>\n<p>He became a punchline for a lot of people. Not only was he a massive underachiever, but now the only coach that wants him is his dad. As you could imagine, Rivers has not had an easy career and it certainly did not get any better after going to L.A.</p>\n<p>But none of that mattered last night. Rivers was not trying to salvage his career. He was not trying to please his father. No … he was trying to do something much, much simpler: win a game for his team.</p>\n<p>What the former Duke point guard displayed was not for the “haters,” the nay-sayers, the critics or even his own father, rather, it was all for his teammates — especially Jamal Crawford — who did believe in him and knew he had it in him to make a difference.</p>\n<p>After receiving 11 stitches under his left eye, Rivers came back and certainly made his presence felt finishing the game with 21 points, eight assists, six rebounds and zero turnovers.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-vine\" style=\"display: block;\"><iframe class=\"vine-embed\" src=\"https://vine.co/v/iPtnn5hr0lv/embed/simple\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Unfortunately for him and his team, Crawford’s final chance to tie the game came up short, and the season was over.</p>\n<p>If his play did not earn him respect, his post-game interview sure did. An emotional point guard went up to the stage and what we saw was a truly authentic display of emotion from a player who truly left it all out on the court.</p>\n<p>With his eye battered, bruised and bleeding, Rivers led his team and literally bled for them to try to win a playoff game to keep their hopes alive.</p>\n<p>That is the stuff that earns you respect from all-around the league. From twitter to the people on the court, many people will never look at Austin the same and he earned that.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70532\" style=\"width: 315px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70532\" data-attachment-id=\"70532\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-30/rivers-performance-exemplifies-why-we-love-sports/nba-playoffs-los-angeles-clippers-at-portland-trail-blazers/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"NBA: Playoffs-Los Angeles Clippers at Portland Trail Blazers\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?fit=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-70532\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?resize=305%2C191\" alt=\"Damian Lillard praising Rivers for his performance Courtesy of Troy Wayrynen-USA TODAY Sports\" width=\"305\" height=\"191\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/austin_043016.jpg?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-70532\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Damian Lillard praising Rivers for his performance. Courtesy of Troy Wayrynen-USA TODAY Sports</p></div>\n<p>And that is what sports is all about.

breeze through the first round of the NBA Playoffs, teams not participating in the postseason continue to watch from afar and prepare for yet another offseason.</p>\n<p>Despite their playoff shortcomings, the time off is still valued as teams are able to learn from their most recent miscues in hopes of making a top eight conference finish the following season. For some NBA teams, the road to success may be more challenging than others, but for a franchise like the Sacramento Kings, the 2017 year could very well stand as their opportunity for growth.</p>\n<p>As the Kings bid farewell to the aging Sleep Train Arena, a home court that has hosted 28 seasons and nested three memorable Pacific Division titles, a pure sense of optimism emanates for its fans in welcoming their new state-of-the-art facility, the Golden One Center.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Looking to spark fan engagement and put Sacramento back on the map, Ranadivé assembled a plan that would get the Kings back on their feet.</p>\n<p>Pairing up with the City Council of Sacramento, an approved vote helped set forth the $507 million dollar deal for the Golden One Center. Set to open just in time for the upcoming NBA season this October, this fresh arena will surely energize a city that has been deprived of winning basketball.</p>\n<p>At 779,000 square feet, up to 19,000 in seating and located in the heart of downtown Sacramento, the Golden One Center acts as an ideal and enticing venue for excitement, culture and live entertainment.</p>\n<p>Ranadivé has also caught the attention of more renowned sports organizations with this newly implemented arena.</p>\n<p>The California Interscholastic Federation and the NCAA have both agreed to make the Golden One Center home of the CIF State Basketball Championships as well as the first two rounds of the NCAA Men’s Division I Tournament.</p>\n<p>With a prime location, a host to iconic sporting events and state-of-the-art facilities that ensure optimum levels of enjoyment, the Golden One Center will not only rejuvenate this urban metropolitan area but also its loyal Kings’ fans.</p>\n<p>While the city of Cleveland seeks its first NBA championship and the Warriors look to neatly wrap up an already historic season, the Kings also have their own goal in mind of rekindling a winning culture.</p>\n<p>Still nostalgic from the early 2000s and in search of a new identity, the Golden One Center will offer the fresh start this NBA franchise eagerly needs. Coming early October, history will be made and the city of Sacramento will embark on a “New Era of Proud.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 5, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"66614\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/flip-minnesotas-hometown-hero/around-the-nba/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=720%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"720,150\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"around the nba\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=250%2C52&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?fit=720%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-66614 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?resize=888%2C185\" alt=\"around the nba\" width=\"888\" height=\"185\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/around-the-nba.png?resize=250%2C52&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70652\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/change-in-home-signals-kings-return-to-throne/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70652\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/change-in-home-signals-kings-return-to-throne/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/change-in-home-signals-kings-return-to-throne/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/change-in-home-signals-kings-return-to-throne/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/change-in-home-signals-kings-return-to-throne/","id":1959,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1958,1957,1956],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
