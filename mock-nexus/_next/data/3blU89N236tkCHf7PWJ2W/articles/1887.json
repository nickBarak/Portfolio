It’s really fun and pretty easygoing, which is good for me especially because balancing school and water polo isn’t the easiest thing to do.”</p>\n<p>In the past, the club has gone to other places away from the campus, but this year they have tried to switch it up a little. No matter where they arrange these events, the connections are still refined.</p>\n<p>“I’ve made a lot of friends in the club and also with the individuals with disabilities, I feel like I developed some strong relationships with them too,” Shore said.<br>\nA four-year member now, Shore has been the vice president this past school year in which she displays her leadership skills that she brings out every day in practice at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p>“There’s a leadership aspect to [Best Buddies],” Shore said. “We have to coordinate with the board and things like that, so stepping up and doing different tasks is kind of similar as my role as captain.”</p>\n<p>Everyone’s aware of the wide range of life lessons that sports provide, but not everyone knows what it’s like to make a difference in the lives of individuals who are less fortunate.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really humbling experience and it shows you there’s more to the world than just water polo,” Shore said. “I’ve dedicated my life to water polo these past however many years, but it’s nice to get involved in other things and meet other people. It’s fun to be involved and make a difference in other people’s lives.”</p>\n<p>Complementing the Corona, the California native’s ability to collaborate and lead others was also influenced by her role in dealing with essentially a fresh team. Yet, she withstood the process of instilling the culture amongst a pool of many newcomers.</p>\n<p>This process occurred over the course of the entire season, whether it was just setting up the pool or going up against top-notch talent.</p>\n<p>“It didn’t turn out how we wanted it to which is kind of a bummer, but I just try to remind myself of the journey,” Shore said.</p>\n<p>Taylor Shore’s water polo journey began when she was just nine years old. She was almost destined to play the sport considering her family’s history with it.</p>\n<p>“My dad played [water polo] when he was younger and my mom swam, so aquatics have been in my family for the longest time,” Shore said. “Both my brothers played [water polo] and I have cousins and uncles that coach, so it’s a big part of my family.”</p>\n<p>Water polo was love at first sight for the crafty do-it-all Gaucho. Her admiration and dedication helped her achieve the goal of playing in college.</p>\n<p>“I just remember day one falling in love with [water polo], and I’ve always been passionate about it,” Shore said. “Playing in college was always something I wanted to do; it was one of my goals for a really long time.”</p>\n<p>Shore brought her competitiveness that she learned from growing up with her two brothers to UCSB where she excelled.</p>\n<p>Even with the prominent role of captaining a young team on her shoulders, the team captain didn’t sink.</p>\n<p>In her final season, Shore also led the team in points, steals and earned ejections. UCSB was 8-0 this year in games where Shore scored a hat trick.</p>\n<p>While her days of scoring in a UCSB cap and suit uniform have come to an end, Shore’s philanthropic endeavors do not end as her collegiate career prepares to conclude.</p>\n<p>Shore’s passion for helping people with developmental and intellectual disabilities will not stop here.</p>\n<p>“I got a job recently at a place called PathPoint,” Shore said. “What we do there is kind of similar but a little different. I would work with adults with disabilities and help them develop life skills or find jobs or teach them how to pay their bills and things like that. I‘m going to do that over summer.”</p>\n<p>However, she still isn’t done with water polo. After working over the summer, Shore plans on testing the professional waters overseas.</p>\n<p>“Come the end of September, I want to go play abroad because I don’t think I’m ready to be done with water polo yet, so I want to go play in Spain for nine months and then come back,” Shore said.</p>\n<p>Very few players in UCSB women’s water polo history can match up with the career thatShore put together.</p>\n<p>From winning the program’s first-ever Big West Tournament championship to leading a young group of players a year later, Shore has been a role model while laying the groundwork for the future of UCSB women’s water polo.</p>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

to turn it around this year.</p>\n<p>A former high school and junior college teammate of Burns, junior SDSU outfielder Chad Bible was set to start his first full Division I collegiate season, but on January 10, 2017, just before the season got under way, he was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma.</p>\n<p>“We had this weekend circled on our calendars to play against each other for the first time,” Burns said. “You would never wish the timing of something like that to happen to anybody, but it fires me up to see that the guys over there have rallied around him so well this season.”</p><!--Ad

the junior college level. But even during that impressive season, he says, he could tell something was wrong.</p>\n<p>“I woke up one day last May and had this lump in my neck,” Bible said. “The doctor said it was normal for kids my age to get inflammation there sometimes, so because of that and the way I was playing, I just never thought anything of it.”</p>\n<p>However, more lumps would appear throughout the summer as he geared up to transfer from College of the Canyons to SDSU for the fall semester. Bible even admits that his girlfriend grew annoyed with him during the summer because all he wanted to do was sleep after games.</p>\n<p>Bible’s dad, Mike, also stated that he always had concerns, adding, “It just never felt right to me from the beginning, and it wasn’t until the third or fourth check-up where they said, ‘I think it’s a waste of your time to get another scan’ that I started to believe it was nothing to worry about.”</p>\n<p>Luckily, Bible told a trainer at SDSU, who referred him to the team doctor. Other tests were done, leading to the biopsy in December of 2016.</p>\n<p>Then came the news that he had cancer.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77364\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/san-diego-state-athlete-headshots/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-77364\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77364\" data-attachment-id=\"77364\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/san-diego-state-athlete-headshots/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"San Diego State Athlete Headshots\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-77364\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug-683x1024.jpg?resize=280%2C420\" alt=\"\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?w=1365&amp;ssl=1 1365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77364\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of SDSU Athletics</p></div>\n<p>“I didn’t really hear anything after the doctor said ‘cancer,’” Bible said. “But after they went into detail that I would have to drop out of school, quit playing baseball and move home for treatment, all I asked was that we started treatment the day after playing Fullerton.”</p>\n<p>After getting the reluctant “okay” from the doctor, Bible said, “That was so huge for me to be able to do that and to not see all this work I’ve put in over the years go to waste.”</p>\n<p>Getting a chance to play Fullerton was another contest circled on Bible’s calendar from a long time ago because it was the university that he attended out of high school. He redshirted his freshman year there, then transferred to College of the Canyons, before finally landing himself at SDSU.</p>\n<p>When looking back on it, Bible uses humor to downplay the situation.</p>\n<p>“I got along great with those guys at Fullerton, and I’ve never been a cancer in the clubhouse,” he joked. “But for whatever reason, the coach and I there just never saw eye to eye.”</p>\n<p>Through the first five games of the season, Bible batted clean-up for the Aztecs, eager to prove to himself and his former Fullerton coach that he could play at the Division 1 level.</p>\n<p>On February 22, 2017, Bible went 2-for-4 in a Wednesday night matchup versus the Fullerton Titans, which would improve and conclude his batting average at .318 for the season, as he would begin treatment the next morning.</p>\n<p>With each ensuing inning, things grew more emotional at Fullerton, though few in attendance knew it. Each time Bible stepped up to the plate, his family could be seen taking pictures of each at-bat behind the SDSU dugout, wiping away tears in the process.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs went on to earn a 5-4 victory that night following a save by SDSU closer CJ Saylor, who gave the game ball to Bible.</p>\n<p>Knowing he would be making his way to start his first round of chemotherapy at the City of Hope in Los Angeles just five hours later, Bible received a hug from each of the Fullerton players in line for handshakes. Some he knew and many he did not, but all were deeply moved by his story.</p>\n<p>Bible’s dad recalls the moment as the most emotional one of his life.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t about the logo on your hat or the colors on your uniform that night,” he said. “It was just a bunch of dudes showing love and respect for something bigger than baseball.”</p>\n<p>Bible stated that the prognosis for him is great, adding that the survival rate is 90 to 95 percent. He has already gone through three rounds of treatment with five more scheduled every other week through the month of June.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77365\" style=\"width: 446px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/bible500/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-77365\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77365\" data-attachment-id=\"77365\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/bible500/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bible500\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-77365\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500-1024x683.jpg?resize=436%2C290\" alt=\"\" width=\"436\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77365\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of SDSU Athletics</p></div>\n<p>He says that he has developed hope from athletes who have walked in his shoes before, such as current Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo and pitcher Jon Lester. Both players were diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma during their careers and made full recoveries after their treatment. In fact, Lester was so moved by Bible’s story that he reached out via text during his treatment.</p>\n<p>“I just want to be an inspiration like those guys,” Bible said. “I mean, people can feel bad, and that’s all fine and dandy.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>At first glance, Armani Smith, does not look like a freshman. In fact, he is already built like the big-league prospect that he is. Standing at 6’3” and weighing 195 pounds, the young utility baseball player from De La Salle High School was drafted in the 35th round by the Cleveland Indians before arriving at UCSB.</p>\n<p>In his first year, Smith burst onto the scene for the Gauchos, hitting well for the majority of the season while playing solid defense in the field. At one point, the freshman was batting third with an average north of .350. Although Smith cooled down a bit, the young Gaucho star finished the season hitting .285 with three homeruns, 24 runs batted in and 32 runs.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But those are just numbers. Smith’s play goes far deeper than what the numbers say. To simply put it, the kid does not get cheated at the plate. With every swing, even when fooled, Smith would let it fly. At times, Smith would swing <em>so</em> hard that even on misses the crowd would “Ooh” and “Ahh” in amazement. The three home runs hit by Smith were not your typical DI home runs, either. Smith would hit one out to deep right center, to deep center <em>on a line</em> and to left field that would clear not only the scoreboard but also the protective net that shields buildings near the stadium. That ball easily soared more than 400 feet, which is scary coming from a freshman. The kid has serious pop.</p>\n<p>What was even more impressive than his tools, though, was how selfless he was for his team. Smith would rover from right field, to left field to second base while moving around in the line-up all season long. Now, this may not sound like a big deal, but playing several positions while being moved around the line-up is one of the most uncomfortable things for a player to do, but Smith made it look easy. Without a doubt, for all his efforts, Armani Smith deserves to be the <em>Nexus</em> Sports Male Freshman of the Year.</p>\n<p><strong>Lindsey Ruddins (W Volleyball) by Omar Hernandez</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78325\" style=\"width: 278px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/lindsey-ruddins-soars-through-the-air-while-serving-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78325\" data-attachment-id=\"78325\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/lindsey-ruddins-soars-through-the-air-while-serving-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/WVball_vsLBSU-161021-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lindsey Ruddins soars through the air while serving.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins had one of the most dominant individual seasons of any athlete at UCSB this year. The redshirt freshman from Laguna Niguel was a scourge on the offensive end, earning the Big West Freshman of the Year award, which hadn’t been awarded to a Gaucho volleyball player since 2012.</p>\n<p>She received a host of other accolades as well, making both the All-Big West and All-Freshman teams along with notching five Freshman of the Week awards.</p>\n<p>On a national level, Ruddins became the first Gaucho since 2012 to be named to the American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) All-American team as an honorable mention, and she also earned honorable mention honors on the AVCA All-Pacific South Region team.</p>\n<p>The year Ruddins had would be considered extraordinary for any player, much less a freshman. To be third in the conference in both kills per set (4.09) and total kills (389) and then sixth in the conference in service aces per set (.31) was no coincidence.</p>\n<p>It shows only the dedication that Ruddins put into practice (redshirting her whole first year to hone her skills) but also her ability to translate what she has learned into an enormous impact on the court.</p>\n<p>UCSB improved by five wins this season, and a lot of that improvement has to do with Ruddins’s exceptional year. Both she and the team have a lot of room to grow; the Gauchos have never made it to the final four of the NCAA tournament, and she still has three years to work on her game. If this year is any indication, however, we could be looking at one of the best talents to ever play for UCSB and a potential NCAA champion as well.</p>\n<p><em>A version of these stories appeared on p. 8 of the June 8, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78419\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78419\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/","id":1885,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Each celebratory scenario serves as a microcosm of the array of past and current African-American MLB players who have contributed to baseball becoming more inclusive and diverse.</p>\n<p>Although widely known for their legacies left on the baseball field, each of the aforementioned former black MLB players were integral influences in black communities nationwide, helping pave the way for African Americans and people of color both on and off the field by confirming that they belonged within “America’s game.”</p>\n<p>This season’s opening day rosters and disabled lists included a league-wide 8 percent of African American players, accounting for a total of 69 black players (via Bob Nightengale, <em>USA Today Sports</em>).</p>\n<p>Helping carry the torch within today’s cohort of black MLB players is Baltimore Orioles All-star center fielder Adam Jones, who has been known to use his social platform to express his thoughts on racial and social injustices.</p>\n<p>For instance, he stated that “baseball is a white man’s sport,” when referring to the MLB’s lack of support during ex-San Francisco 49ers’ quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s protest of the national anthem this past NFL season.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Jones shared his distraught emotions concerning the taunting of racial slurs, which he experienced when he was called the “n-word” and had a bag of peanuts thrown at him in game one of the Orioles-Red Sox series at Fenway Park.</p>\n<p>Since then, various apologies were issued to Jones by Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, the Boston Red Sox organization and others in attempt to reduce the uproar caused by the select Boston fans who attacked Jones Monday night.</p>\n<p>The incident has ignited much speculation regarding the debate as to whether or not all cities are racist or if it is just certain citizens who hold discriminatory and unjust perceptions of minorities.</p>\n<p>Yet rather than seek a solution to this question, the biggest concern is how citizens, fans, the media and players will rationalize the hatred spewed toward Jones.</p>\n<p>The individuals responsible for their ill-advised behavior will rightly face consequences, but the issue at stake goes beyond just placing the blame upon a few “ignorant” or “uneducated” people.</p>\n<p>Jones’s experience was a reminder of the systemic racism that remains ingrained within society, impacting the sports realm as well.</p>\n<p>People critique this institutional structure and question, for example, “Well, if institutionalized racism exists, then why have these players been able to achieve such success and make it to the MLB?”</p>\n<p>That’s just the masking of the root issue at hand. Whether in society, sports, housing, education, jobs or any other industry, institutional racism must be acknowledged. A mutual understanding must be reached regarding the fact that there’s no single, concrete solution to a system that includes centuries of oppression.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, progress in sport has been made since the breaking of the color barrier, but that feat alone was and still is not the final verdict to racism in sports.</p>\n<p>The possibility to combat its systemic presence is plausible and is a work in progress. Both Boston fans and the Red Sox organization deserve credit for applauding Jones in his first at-bat appearance in Tuesday night’s game, while news surfaced on Wednesday that a fan was banned from Fenway Park for using a racial slur against another fan during Tuesday’s game.</p>\n<p>Understanding that this week’s incident won’t be the last of a minority athlete being racially discriminated against is frustrating and somewhat numbing as it is expected. However, it is important for each of us to keep the goal of achieving social justice at the forefront of our societal priorities.</p>\n<p>It begins with each of us individually, yet it evolves when combined with the influence of sports.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the May 4, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77591\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/institutionalized-disbanning-social-injustices-cyclical-presence-in-sports/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77591\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/institutionalized-disbanning-social-injustices-cyclical-presence-in-sports/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/institutionalized-disbanning-social-injustices-cyclical-presence-in-sports/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/institutionalized-disbanning-social-injustices-cyclical-presence-in-sports/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/institutionalized-disbanning-social-injustices-cyclical-presence-in-sports/","id":1886,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1885,1884,1883],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
