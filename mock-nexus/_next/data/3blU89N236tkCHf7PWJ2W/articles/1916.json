Their early season struggles last year were the last straw in what had been an extremely tough transition period after Luis Suarez left for Barcelona.</p>\n<p>Five games into the next season, now led by Jürgen Klopp — a genius of high-pressing football and a cultural icon that seems to breathe belief and hope into LFC and it’s fans — and the Reds are flying high. Liverpool is impressing with 13 points (4-1-1) and sitting pretty in fourth, including wins at Arsenal and Chelsea and at home to Leicester; the Premier League is as loaded as it’s ever been with top-four quality sides, Champions League would be a great success for the German in his first full season in charge.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73112\" style=\"width: 415px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73112\" data-attachment-id=\"73112\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/how-klopp-made-liverpool-contenders-in-less-than-a-year/liverpool1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liverpool1.jpg?fit=2500%2C3000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2500,3000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"liverpool1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liverpool1.jpg?fit=208%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liverpool1.jpg?fit=853%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-73112\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liverpool1.jpg?resize=405%2C486\" alt=\"Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus\" width=\"405\" height=\"486\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liverpool1.jpg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liverpool1.jpg?resize=208%2C250&amp;ssl=1 208w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liverpool1.jpg?resize=768%2C922&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liverpool1.jpg?resize=853%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 853w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liverpool1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-73112\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The former Dortmund manager was quick to implement his trademark <em>gegenpress</em> when he joined Liverpool, immediately asking his players to hunt in packs high up to pitch to win back the ball before attacking again with quick, incisive passes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

His lack of depth in the back wasn’t suited to the high-intensity style. His midfield lacked burning pace. His frontline was too thin and Daniel Sturridge suffered from injuries most of the season.</p>\n<p>This summer was the first time Klopp was able to buy and sell players from his squad to real effect — January isn’t the best time for a rebuild by any means — and the German bought perfectly.</p>\n<p>He brought Sadio Mane that gives them a winger that’s proving to be one of the Premier League’s finest players. Before Mane arrived, Liverpool was loaded with creative attacking midfielders in Coutinho, Roberto Firmino and Adam Lallana, but lacked someone who could just blow past defenders and run in behind effectively. The purchase of Georginio Wijnaldum from Newcastle also brought balance to the midfield with his top-class workrate and skillful distribution.</p>\n<p>Joël Matip on a free transfer and goalkeeper Loris Karius for under five million pounds could eventually develop the Reds into one of the hardest teams to score on as well. Matip was a first-choice center-back in FC Shalke 04’s side for nearly seven years, and has played in two World Cups for Cameroon despite only being 25 years old. Karius, the 23-year-old new boy from Mainz, was voted by Bundesliga players in a poll by Kicker to be the second best goalkeeper in the league, trailing only worlds’s best, Manuel Neuer.</p>\n<p>Klopp didn’t completely rebuild his squad at all; in fact, he kept every core player from last year’s team, but the additions he made were crucial. Each one was well-considered and filled a recognizable gap in Rodgers’s version of Liverpool.</p>\n<p>The biggest question asked of Liverpool this season has been of their ability, or inability, to kill off games against the Prem’s worst sides, highlighted by their 2-0 loss to Burnley. It must be noted, though, that four of the Reds’ first five games came against Champions-League-caliber teams, and, in all three of their wins, Klopp’s men have simply looked the better team.</p>\n<p>The smiling Jurgen Klopp has put Liverpool back on the tip of people’s tongues by creating a team capable of a burst of goals rivaled only by the world’s superclubs. Combined with the emotion of the Anfield faithful, the revived Reds have already shared what’s to come. Last season’s win against Manchester City and a magical comeback against Dortmund to advance to the Europa League final were just samples of the inevitable glory to come.</p>\n<p>When watching LFC play at home, the German manager has created a bond between players and fans that just oozes confidence and a belief in a club’s project as great as what’s present at Liverpool is almost unrecognizable in modern football. The players trust the coach and the coach trusts the players. The fans shouldn’t expect to win the league, but there’s plenty of reason to hope.</p>\n<p>Klopp brought two legendary Bundesliga titles to Dortmund over the Bavarian giants Bayern Munich, etching his name in football history, but one would be a fool to assume he’s done winning, especially with his team beginning to look as clinical as his title-winning sides this early in the Premier League season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

community and those who are supporting it,” Leets said.  Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The list was first debuted last year, after Craig Leets, current director of the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), was hired. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Dr. Nathaniel Burke, who’s the coordinator of equity and inclusion for the Division of Student Affairs, wanted to do an Out List and mentioned that to me as I was interviewing for this position, actually, and one of the things they were looking for in a new director was someone who had done an Out List before,” said Leets, who managed an Out List at Portland State University for several years before he started at UCSB last fall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of the list is to create a “visual representation of the community and those who are supporting it,” Leets said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In many ways, LGBTQ identities are invisible, right?” he said. “We can’t look at someone and know they are LGBTQ, and so LGBTQ people look around them on a campus and they don’t know who else is LGBTQ and don’t know who’s supportive or welcoming to LGBTQ people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing those folks publicly acknowledging themselves as LGBTQ or as supporters can be really powerful for a student to feel like they’re not the only LGBTQ in their class, in their department or on campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this year’s list will be launched on Friday, Leets updates the list on a rolling basis even after the deadline for sign-ups passes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, 471 students, staff and faculty signed up for the 2018 Out List over the course of the year; as of Tuesday afternoon, the 2019 Out List was at 494 sign-ups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re really excited that this early in the year … we’ve already exceeded that number from last year, but my hope is that we’ll get a few more and be able to get above 500 for when we release the list on Friday,” Leets said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leets emphasized that the list is not meant to be an “all-encompassing” list of LGBTQ individuals on the campus, particularly since there are many people who cannot be out publicly, either for personal or professional reasons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Leets acknowledged that there was the potential that the list could be used for “nefarious” reasons, he also said that anyone who signed up for the list was reminded during the sign-up process that they weren’t obligated to include any information they didn’t feel comfortable being publicly available. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s one of those things that it’s impactful for the people who need it, but for people who don’t, I’m not sure they know it exists,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stephenson Brooks Whitestone, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Communication who was on the Out List last year, emphasized the importance of such a resource to combat the “the alienation and isolation that many queer students feel — from the families, from their classmates, even from childhood friends,” she said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The [Out List] is [a] tangible symbol of queer people living their lives openly and honestly,” Whitestone added. “The knowledge that queer people live, survive and thrive here at UCSB is both comforting and empowering.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whitestone said that no students have reached out to her specifically because she’s on the list, but said she still likes “having [her] name on the list, and in a sense, adding to the length of the list.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whitestone noted that visibility can be a “tricky issue in the queer community” due to pressure to come out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But no one should become visible if they do not feel safe — physically or emotionally — to do so.

however, can we truly distinguish OBJ within the cohort of diva receivers?</p>\n<p>What I like to consider as the entertainers of an offense, wideouts suitably have a more flashy approach to the game in comparison to other positions on the field.</p>\n<p>As a receiver, the mentality is different.</p>\n<p>Matched up one-on-one against a cornerback for the majority of a game, some receivers’ mindsets are ingrained with the notion they can’t be stopped by any defender on the field.</p>\n<p>Adding a diva presence to this outlook can be the flashy celebrations or nonchalant attitudes toward the media that some receivers express.</p>\n<p>With a history of receivers such as Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson, Terrell Owens and Randy Moss as prime examples within the class of divas, it seems every few years there is a new name that emerges.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73496\" style=\"width: 418px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73496\" data-attachment-id=\"73496\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/the-diva-charade-is-obj-its-next-victim/football1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1.jpg?fit=2550%2C3300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2550,3300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"football1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1.jpg?fit=193%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1.jpg?fit=791%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-73496\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1-791x1024.jpg?resize=408%2C528\" alt=\"Nathan Campos / Daily Nexus\" width=\"408\" height=\"528\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1.jpg?resize=791%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 791w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1.jpg?resize=193%2C250&amp;ssl=1 193w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1.jpg?resize=768%2C994&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-73496\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nathan Campos / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Known for his touchdown celebrations, blond-dyed hair, Head &amp; Shoulders commercials, gracing the Madden 2016 cover, having a friendship with Drake and, of course, the unforgettable one-handed catch, Beckham is constantly surrounded by the glitz and glamour of superstardom, especially while in one of the nation’s biggest markets: New York.</p>\n<p>Currently in his third season, Beckham is well-deserving of the praise he receives for his performance on the field. His 2,744 receiving yards through his first two seasons is the most in NFL history, eclipsing the previous record of 2,726 yards set by Randy Moss.</p>\n<p>Although his immediate impact will be considered, the question of whether Beckham belongs within the diva class still persists.</p>\n<p>Quite frankly, the answer is no. Beckham is not a diva.</p>\n<p>It’s as if people have forgotten the exuberance and appreciation we had when tuning in not to watch the New York Giants play but rather to see the performance of Odell Beckham Jr.</p>\n<p>From the pregame catching drills full of one-handed snags to graceful jumps in the air displaying his vertical explosiveness, Beckham has served as the main attraction since his introduction to the Big City of Dreams.</p>\n<p>Sure, each player has their own way of expressing their anger when frustrated or dealing with overcoming the challenge of biting on the bait of an opponent, but is it plausible to define a player by such a behavior?</p>\n<p>In the case of Beckham, excluding his fiery and sensitive character when on the field, he hasn’t been a true detriment to the Giants’ success.</p>\n<p>While he deserves to be held accountable for the penalties he has amassed this season, a total of three (one apiece for taunting, unsportsmanlike conduct and offensive pass interference), Beckham has yet to be the reason as to why the Giants have lost games.</p>\n<p>With Super Bowl XLVI being the New York Giants’ last postseason appearance, it’s safe to say that OBJ is not an inhibiting element in the team’s playoff hopes.</p>\n<p>But football is a team sport in which brotherhood is vital to the locker-room culture, right? No individual player should be excused of the team’s successes and failures, correct?</p>\n<p>Despite the truths of both of these questions, the team loyalty of players such as quarterback Eli Manning and first-year Head Coach Ben McAdoo has to be acknowledged as they both proclaimed Beckham’s sideline acts to be a distraction to the team.</p>\n<p>Yes, Beckham was a distraction. But shouldn’t these issues be attended to and resolved internally? The calling out of Beckham just added more fuel to the fire in painting the progression of the wideout receiving the diva label.</p>\n<p>By making claims of football not being fun anymore to celebrating on the sidelines, mocking his incident with the kicking net in the form of a proposal, Beckham has become one of the league’s most unpredictable personalities.</p>\n<p>Of course it is always more appealing to be on the positive end of this spectrum, but sometimes the reserved or under under-the-radar demeanor of some players doesn’t exist for all.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider the Hall of Fame career of Terrell Owens.</p>\n<p>Second in all-time NFL career receiving yards with 15, 934 yards, third in receiving touchdowns at 153, sixth all-time in career receptions with 1,078 receptions, the record holder for receptions in a single-game with 20 to go along with a multitude of other accolades, Owens is one of the greatest wide receivers in NFL history.</p>\n<p>While his renowned talent and statistical achievements surpass the qualifications of a Hall of Fame nomination, it was the diva stigma that prevented Owens from being a first ballot Hall of Famer.</p>\n<p>Yes, Owens was a diva, beyond the behavior of Beckham thus far. Yes, he did play on five different teams in his NFL career. But, most importantly, he produced when it mattered most and at some point reigned as the league’s best wide receiver. These are facts that should have outweighed personality in the evaluation of Owens.</p>\n<p>Two different players, two different personalities cut from a different cloth.</p>\n<p>The narrative of the diva wide receiver remains and is here to stay.

The backlash mainly took shape in the form of student-created petitions that circulated earlier this summer, asking Yang to step down from his role as chair. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the speakers, Hawaiian activist Laulani Teale, emphasized that the crux of the conflict between Native Hawaiians and TMT is a matter of consent, as the developers of TMT are operating on land where many people native to it were not given the chance to approve the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the conversation continued, Pisciotta moved on to address a common accusation the protestors faced, that by standing against TMT, Native Hawaiian protestors are also standing against science. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Nobody’s against science,” Pisciotta said. “The science was asking us, ‘What is our alternative [to building TMT]?’ But that question doesn’t belong to us. It actually belongs [to those working on the telescope].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How can you build something 18 stories high, [with a] stadium-size footprint and not frustrate the endangered species and the land and the water of Mauna Kea? So the question now becomes ‘How does science innovate to find a better solution that doesn’t do that?”’ she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In July, dozens of Hawaiian elders were arrested for obstructing Mauna Kea’s only access road, the </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/science/mauna-kea-protest.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including Liko Martin, the “Bard of Aloha ‘Aina,” who attended Tuesday’s town hall. Martin spoke, sang and played guitar to the town hall’s attendees, performing several songs in which he wrote about Hawaii’s occupation by the U.S. government and the proposed development of TMT. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martin compared his time in the Hawaiian courthouse after he was arrested for protesting to being on an “auction block,” with a frenzy of lawyers vying to represent the elders as they entered the courthouse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was 33 of us [arrested]. The night before we went in there … I got the feeling [that] tomorrow we’re going to be on the auction block,” Martin said. “That’s exactly how it came down. All these attorneys are running around like, ‘We’ll take this one!’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was like throwing my fishing hook in [the courthouse]. I didn’t even have to put any bait on it,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are currently 13 other telescopes on Mauna Kea, but none as expensive as TMT, which is estimated to cost over a billion dollars, the </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/science/hawaii-telescope-tmt-mauna-kea.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times Reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; $300 million of the funding will be provided by the UC and Caltech, partially funded through a $200 million donation from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, according to the </span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=gordon+and+betty+moore+foundation+tmt&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS791US791&amp;oq=gor&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0l4j69i60l2.1253j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">foundation’s website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student fees are not used as part of TMT’s funding, according to Claire Doan, UC Office of the President spokesperson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If completed, TMT will provide images 12 times sharper than the Hubble Space Telescope, according to a </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/thirty-meter-telescope-will-be-most-powerful-eye-sky\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Construction on the telescope, however, won’t be complete until at least 2030, assuming construction begins in 2020, Teale said.

Otherwise, TMT’s lease for the land will expire, and “the people of Hawaii have been very clear that they have no intention to renew [the] lease.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91724\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-12-07/hawaiian-activists-speak-at-ucsb-town-hall-urge-uc-not-to-move-forward-with-telescope-construction/mauna-kea_kaiyi-yang_online/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-91724\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91724\" data-attachment-id=\"91724\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-07/hawaiian-activists-speak-at-ucsb-town-hall-urge-uc-not-to-move-forward-with-telescope-construction/mauna-kea_kaiyi-yang_online/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?fit=2048%2C1393&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1393\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Mauna Kea_Kaiyi Yang_ONLINE\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?fit=250%2C170&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?fit=888%2C604&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-91724\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=888%2C604\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"604\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=250%2C170&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=768%2C522&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=1024%2C697&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-91724\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although criticism of Yang’s involvement with TMT sparked earlier this summer, Daevionne Beasley, the Associated Students (A.S.) EVPSA, said that despite faltering in recent months, students have made progress in explaining their views to the chancellor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley did note that he and AISA members Jeike Meijer — a former External Vice President Local Affairs — and Anthony Cowell ‘19 met with Yang and A.S.
