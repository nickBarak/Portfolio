Tech Rental, A.S. Bike Committee projects and possible contributions to the Davidson Library expansion and renovation.</p>\n<p>A.S. controller and fourth-year electrical engineering major Amir Khazaieli spoke to Senate about a proposed program to expand A.S.’s current i&gt;Clicker rental service into “A.S. Tech Rental,” which will loan students equipment such as calculators and phone and laptop chargers.</p>\n<p>“The i&gt;Clicker rental program pilot gave us much insight on this type of project,” Khazaieli said. “For Spring Quarter 2015, forty i&gt;Clickers were loaned out.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli said A.S. Tech Rental will have a website to help students understand the program.</p>\n<p>“[It] will have all the listed items with a picture of the item next to it, the loan time limit, the loan price, the liability price, and if the item is currently in stock and available,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Khazaieli said the estimated prices for 24-hour rental start at $1 for scientific calculators and $5 for graphing calculators. Phone and laptop chargers will be free for four-hour periods. Depending on the item rented, rental periods will range between four hours to one full quarter.</p>\n<p>The estimated start-up cost of A.S. Tech Rental Program is $586.60 and A.S. is looking into reducing costs by purchasing used items from students, according to Khazaieli.</p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the things we would be looking to do with a grant potentially is to create traffic lights on Pardall that would be at the Embarcadero intersections to make them a lot safer and also just to slow down traffic. – A.S. Bike Committee Vice Chair Patrick “Mac” Kennedy</p></blockquote>\n<p>A.S. Bike Committee Vice Chair and third-year history major Patrick “Mac” Kennedy updated Senate on the Committee’s plans for fall quarter.</p>\n<p>Kennedy said the Bike Committee is pursuing outside funding for projects, such as installing traffic lights on Pardall Rd.</p>\n<p>“One of the things we would be looking to do with a grant potentially is to create traffic lights on Pardall that would be at the Embarcadero intersections to make them a lot safer and also just to slow down traffic,” Kennedy said. “There are a lot of bad accidents there.”</p>\n<p>According to Kennedy, a second A.S. bike shop is under construction at the San Joaquin Apartments to better serve those living in off-campus, university-owned housing.</p>\n<p>“There’s already like 2,000 students who don’t have access to the bike shop,” Kennedy said. “There’s about to be 2,000 more with Sierra Madre and San Joaquin.”</p>\n<p>Kennedy also said the Committee wants to repave the bike path near Girvetz Hall and expand bike parking near the Life Sciences Building, Humanities and Social Sciences Building and Harold Frank Hall.</p>\n<p>Third-year biochemistry major Leah Johnson requested the Senate’s approval to receive $900 from Community Affairs Board (CAB) to cater a dinner sponsored by Camp Kesem, an organization that raises money for children of parents diagnosed with cancer.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator and second-year history of public policy major Cassandra Mancini said Senate should honor CAB’s decision and approve the funding for Camp Kasem.</p>\n<p>“This is their first year on campus,” Mancini said. “CAB wanted to support them. CAB made the decision to fund them because they thought the organization and event was important. I think we should respect CAB’s decision and grant them the funds.”</p>\n<p>College of Engineering Collegiate Senator and fourth-year mechanical engineering major Jonathan Rothchild said the Camp Kesem should receive funding from CAB because of their initiative in seeking sponsorship.</p>\n<p>“They go out and actively seek sponsorship,” Rothschild said. “They’re a very strong organization. I support their cause wholeheartedly.”</p>\n<p>Senate approved the CAB’s funding Camp Kesem.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Some of the things that were brought up included … outfitting all UCPD police with body cams. – A.S. President Ali Guthy</p></blockquote>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy, who spoke with UC President Janet Napolitano at the Council of Presidents last week, said she and Napolitano talked about addressing police misconduct.</p>\n<p>“Some of the things that were brought up included … outfitting all UCPD police with body cams,” Guthy said. “The President promised to do some research on the cost of that, as well as talking about mental health services.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, Napolitano will increase the student services fee to fund mental health programs.</p>\n<p>“She plans to increase the student services fee and have 50 percent of those funds allocated to mental health,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>Senate gave Chief Financial Officer and fourth-year sociology major Andre Theus $950 to print 2,500 copies of the new Financial Resource Guide on recycled paper.</p>\n<p>College of Letters and Science Collegiate Senator and third-year history of public policy major Jimmy Villarreal said no unallocated funds are left.</p>\n<p>“We’ve exhausted our senate unallocated funds,” Villarreal said.</p>\n<p>New senate unallocated funds will be available when the new fiscal year begins in July.</p>\n<p>After approving the 2015-’16 budget, Senate had a $17,794.74 balance to reallocate. They granted the A.S. Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee $1,000 and moved the difference to unallocated.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared in the May 7, 2015 issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63204\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/senate-talks-calculators-bikes-library-expansion/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63204\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/senate-talks-calculators-bikes-library-expansion/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/senate-talks-calculators-bikes-library-expansion/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/senate-talks-calculators-bikes-library-expansion/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/senate-talks-calculators-bikes-library-expansion/","id":2781,"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum"},"related":[2780,2779,2778],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":147,"name":"Noah Brennan-Greenbaum","biography":"Not available","articles":[2461,2527,2644,2727,2746,2781,2800,2805,2828,2829,2839,2847,2851,2857,2864,2910,2924,2949,2966,2972,2995,4569,4574,4674,4676,4677,4701,4719,4723,4740,4750,4763,4771,4776,4780,4788,4793,4798,4800,4809],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Governance Board could potentially manage the Pardall Center if A.S. does not establish a special administration.</p>\n<p>“I would imagine that these future spaces would have somewhat of a different charge, and if they don’t, then maybe this existing committee could manage spaces with similar missions,” Moreh said.</p>\n<p>The committee tabled the bill to allow senators more time to become familiar with its language, according to Moreh.</p>\n<p>“It’s something that is pretty big since we are creating something, and I just wouldn’t want anyone to come and say, ‘I don’t feel as though there was enough time for senators to look at it,’” Moreh said. “We want to create something that is going to be a model that we can work under for years to come.”</p>\n<p>Moreh said a temporary committee comprised of members of I.V. Tenants Union (IVTU), I.V. Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) and Pardall Center staff members will continue to hold meetings Mondays at 4 p.m. beginning May 11 in the conference room of the Pardall Center to discuss the facility’s administration.</p>\n<p>“The way that the [committee] was made was so that anyone could join and become a voting member. Ideally, we would have advertised that, but we didn’t have enough time to get the word out,” Moreh said. “Anyone can come — it is an open meeting — but those are the people currently discussing it.”</p>\n<p>According to Moreh, the committee tabled the bill to allow for the inclusion of amendments that give IVTU and the Legal Resource Center autonomy as renting tenants of the Pardall Center.</p>\n<p>“IVTU and LRC want to be able to have as much autonomy as possible since they are tenants and they should have the ability to run their own space,” Moreh said. “They are on the board, but we also guaranteed them that there would be something in this legislation that would say they have autonomy.”</p>\n<p>EAC sent A Bill to Create the Standing Policies &amp; Procedures of the Pardall Center of The Standing Policies and Procedures of the A.S. UCSB to the consent calendar.</p>\n<p>A Bill to Create Policy 35 will foster more connections between A.S. and I.V., according to Moreh.</p>\n<p>“It is hard because the only one is Pardall Center right now,” Moreh said. “The point is to eventually have so many different paths.”</p>\n<p>Moreh said the bill lays out the expectations, behaviors, parking, advertising and other “dos and don’ts” for use of the Pardall Center.</p>\n<p>“It is important to have because we have had some issues in the Pardall Center and, like any public space, there needs to be a set of policies that governs this space so that we can enforce respectful behavior,” Moreh said.</p>\n<p>After discussing both bills, EAC moved to a discussion on campaigns to address tuition hikes and the upcoming Week of Healing to remember the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>First-year political science and Asian American studies double major Akshaya Natarajan said A.S. is using the “Dear Governor Brown” campaign and a recently released online petition to combat tuition hikes</p>\n<p>“The petition is specifically asking Governor Brown to commit to invest $100 million in the UC system which would freeze tuition which would offset tuition hikes,” Natarajan said.</p>\n<p>Natarajan also discussed “We’re Fucked,” a project to publicize problems caused by state disinvestment in higher education.</p>\n<p>“Our tuition is going up, we aren’t able to pay for very basic necessities, our little brothers and little sisters won’t be able to go to college,” Natarajan said.</p>\n<p>According to Natarajan, A.S. will soon table, host a panel discussion with faculty, share student testimonials and distribute t-shirts to educate students about Dear Governor Brown.</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major and Off-campus Senator Paola Dela Cruz said there will be an art gallery, memorial garden and other installments for the Week of Healing.</p>\n<p>“The Parks District worked closely with the families, they made sure each bench was designed to represent each student,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>Representative-at-large Senator Victor Garcia said the Residence Halls Association (RHA) is participating in BLUNITE, a memorial art installment made up of blue LED lights.</p>\n<p>“RHA has actually bought 300 LED lights for each [residence] hall — so around like 2,700 lights — and they’re going to be distributed at each front desk so residents can come and pick up a light and put a light on their windowsill,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>EAC Chair and third-year anthropology major Carlos Lopez concluded the meeting with information about the AB 3 Sacramento Lobby Day this Wednesday. According to Lopez, organizers plan to bring I.V. residents to Sacramento to promote Assemblymember Das Williams’ I.V. self-governance bill, AB 3, before its hearing in the California State Assembly Committee on Local Government.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to get at least 20 people to go up there to honestly show there is community-supported favor of AB 3 instead of just homeowners — who are going to drive up there because they don’t have school — to say that they don’t want it, or people that are opposed to it in general,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article originally quoted Michelle Moreh as saying “this existing committee could manage spaces with similar commissions,” however the correct quote reads “this existing committee could manage spaces with similar missions.” The article also stated the EAC could potentially manage the Pardall Center, while Moreh in fact said an A.S. in I.V. Governance Board could be created to potentially manage the Pardall Center. The article said this was the first EAC meeting, but the committee has met on previous Mondays at 4 p.m. In addition, Moreh said the bill was tabled to allow for the inclusion of amendments to give IVTU and the Legal Resource Center the majority of power, when the amendments actually allowed IVTU and the Legal Resource Center autonomy as renting tenants.]</p>\n<p><em>This story was updated as of 11:23 p.m. on May 12, 2015.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Proxies are defined as temporary stand-ins for Senators unable attend Senate meetings who must be approved by the Board of Directors and are able to vote for the absent Senator, according to the A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p>“Senator proxies cannot be people that have declared their candidacy to run in any on-going elections,” Santos said. “I added in this highlighted piece that says Senator proxies cannot be current executives.”</p>\n<p>According to On-Campus Senator and second-year religious studies and philosophy double major Jennifer Liem, the Fraternity and Sorority Council changed their name to the Multicultural Greek Council, so Article VI of the A.S. Legal Code should be updated accordingly.</p>\n<p>“I think that we should also change the Fraternity Sorority Council, because I am on that council and we changed that name to Multicultural Greek Council,” Liem said.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator and second-year history of public policy major Cassandra Mancini said the A.S. legal code should list the new Professional Greek Council as a Greek community alongside the Inter-Fraternity Council, Collegiate Panhellenic Council, National Panhellenic Council and the Multicultural Greek Council.</p>\n<p>“Apparently it is a new thing,” Mancini said. “They just started getting their stuff together.”</p>\n<p>Mancini said the bill to update media and publicity policy would link the official A.S. page to the A.S. Facebook page.</p>\n<p>“You can tag pages to A.S. UCSB and apparently we have a Wikipedia,” Mancini said. “Associated Students didn’t know that. I was going to add to the bill once I think about this for a little bit, how to have everyone have this community page about A.S. UCSB.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63108\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/a-s-discusses-legal-code-changes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63108\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/a-s-discusses-legal-code-changes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/a-s-discusses-legal-code-changes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/a-s-discusses-legal-code-changes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-06/a-s-discusses-legal-code-changes/","id":2780,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2779,2778,2777],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
