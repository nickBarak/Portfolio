The Gauchos were in search of clinching the No. 1 seed in the Big West North Division standings in their final home match of the season.</p>\n<p>A 0-0 draw was the final result of the weekday game as neither of the two teams managed to net goals during the 90 minutes of regulation play.  Nearly changing the match’s narrative was the forward-to-forward connection of freshman Rodney Michael and sophomore Ignacio Tellechea.</p>\n<p>In the match’s 58<sup>th</sup> minute, Michael sent a cross from the wing of the field to Tellechea, who then struck the ball into the net. Unfortunately, the play was called offside and the score still remained 0-0.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“If you think about it, that right there was the four, five goals we needed. So, in the end, it just comes down to personnel and the function of forwards [not making plays quick enough and passing] and playing as forwards,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>UCSB is now 6-6-5 and 4-2-3 in the Big West, while Sac. St. sits at 8-7-2, 4-3-2. Santa Barbara came into the match second in the division with 14 points, while Sac St. was third with 13.</p>\n<p>Following Wednesday’s match, no changes took place in the North Division standings as the Gaucho-Hornet stalemate led to one point for both teams, leaving UCSB in second (15 points) and Sac St. in third (14 points), however, UC Davis was crowned the Big West North Division champion after its 2-1 victory over Cal Poly on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The game whistle sounded and both teams were off to a booming start. The Sac State Hornets were the first to strike as Gaucho freshman keeper saved an open shot on goal. This would be the first of only two on target shots the Hornets had all night.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos then peppered in a couple shot of their own, but besides foul trouble from both ends, the rest of the first half remained pretty stagnant regardless of all the team substitutions. Both teams would end up with a combined total of 33 infractions on the night.</p>\n<p>A standout moment in regulation, was when a Red Card was given to the Gaucho bench in the 68<sup>th</sup> minute, in response to their passionate reaction to what the team felt was a no call.</p>\n<p>As for the second half of play, UCSB went ahead and took reign of possession. This eventually proved to be a recurring theme for the home side as it seemed every following counterattack was called offside as well leading to the Gauchos seventh overtime match of the season, the fourth that went into OT tied 0-0.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were instantly aggressive in the opening minutes of the first OT period, attempting three corner kicks in a row, but to no avail. There was only one shot attempted in the second OT period for either team, and that shot was by senior Kim.</p>\n<p>The lack of playmaking ability from the midfield was prevalent as all key passes from half field just seemed to be swallowed up by the Hornet defensive line. In the end, the end of the game had arrived and both teams settled for the draw.</p>\n<p>“Our forwards are young; they work hard and have loads of talent. But passing is sometimes an afterthought for them. So when they finally get into that situation, it’s too late, which is why we need a guy that can get up the field and make those passes,” Vom Steeg said. “Subsequently, it’s forward passing to forward so these passes end up being too short, too far or behind. Which is when the goalie comes running up at you and you won’t have enough time to run around him or chip the ball over.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this was the case for both teams. Regardless of all the counterattacks and offside calls, neither side was able to pull the trigger and earn the winning goal. Whether it was nerves or just quality defense on both ends, it was a great showing no doubt.</p>\n<p>Senior night was also upon us and some of the Gauchos were about to play their final regular season home game of the season. Players being honored recognized for their contribution to the team included: seniors Seo-In Kim, Omar Montalvo, Josue Salgado, Alex Liua, and Randy Mendoza. Each of these players started or were subbed throughout the match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now head away for their last game of the season as they face Cal Poly in the last installment of this year’s Blue Green men’s soccer rivalry beginning at 7 p.m. on Saturday, October 28 at Alex G. Spanos Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79344\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79344\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/","id":1386,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1385,1384,1383],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites","biography":"Not available","articles":[56,87,92,96,105,107,1004,1028,1033,1040,1076,1080,1112,1113,1124,1131,1134,1135,1149,1153,1155,1161,1163,1164,1167,1168,1171,1174,1193,1199,1200,1203,1206,1207,1264,1281,1288,1289,1292,1293,1302,1306,1308,1311,1316,1317,1319,1323,1337,1379,1381,1384,1386,1395,1396,1398,1496,1512,1526,1642,1645,1661,1664,1778,1779,1780,1782,1783,1784,1861,1882,1888,3340,3345,3361,3382,3383,3395,3414,3420,4826,4829,4832,4872,4873,4874,4878,4882,4915,4917,4918,4936,4938,4939,4940,4941,4942,4944,4945,4946,4947,4948,4949,4968,5555,5556,5558,5562,5563,5583,5589,5590,5591],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Endure Worst Home Loss Since 1998","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Following its OT win at Sac St. during the week, the UCSB men's soccer team was unable to sustain its momentum in its home match versus UC Davis.

The Gauchos have one more home game against Sacramento State and will play their final game of the regular season at Cal Poly on Saturday night.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Davis managed to put up its first point on the board in the eighth minute when senior Greg Salazar serviced a well-placed pass to a waiting Adam Mickelson, who sent a shot off his left foot past the Gauchos freshman goalie Alan Carrillo.</p>\n<p>Mickelson’s goal was just the beginning to the Aggies’ barrage of goals as they continued to create scoring chances. In the 33rd minute, redshirt junior forward Matt Baringer found himself on the receiving end of a deflection, which he fired into the net for his fifth goal of the season. The unassisted effort added on to the team’s early lead, increasing the Aggies’ lead to 2-0, landing the Gauchos in an even deeper ditch.</p>\n<p>Right before the end of the first half, in the 41st minute, senior defender Kyle Higgins found himself on the breakaway while dribbling a pass from teammate Onah Power, managing to get past a Davis defender to find the back of the net.</p>\n<p>The first half was brought to an end with the Aggies on top 3-0, bringing back deja vu of the two teams’ previous match which ended with a 3-0 shutout victory.</p>\n<p>By halftime, the Gauchos defense had given up five shots to the Aggies and Carrillo did not manage to make a single save. The defense was shaky in the first half and was able to constantly create chances on the offensive end. The Davis defense was able to hold the Gauchos to no shots at halftime, as the home team just could not get too many good looks at the net.</p>\n<p>The second half kicked off and it was much of the same from the Davis offense. The rhythm the team had found in the first half had clearly continued into the second, with the team being able to notch another point on the board when Power was able to find senior Noah Wilson to make the game 4-0, in the 57th minute. Power notched his first two assists of the season to tie him for third best on the team.</p>\n<p>It was only five minutes later that the Aggies were able to score again with Mickelson striking yet again for his fourth goal on the season. The game ended 5-0 in favor of Davis.</p>\n<p>The multi-point nights from multiple Aggies in Saturday’s matchup were an indicator of the Gauchos’ collapse on defense. Excluding the first goal, each half had the scores occur within ten minutes of each other.</p>\n<p>The Aggies’ various quick bursts on offense were able to cut through the Gauchos’ defense, who left too many open looks, too many times on the pitch. Davis finished with 12 shots, of which half were shots on goal.</p>\n<p>Carrillo ended the match with just one save. It was a tough night for the keeper who was outstanding in play last week. The UCSB offense was able to take four shots in the second half, but forced the Davis keepers to only make one save. Senior midfielder Seo-in Kim was responsible for both of the Gauchos’ two shots on goal.</p>\n<p>The five goals allowed and no goals scored performance by the Gauchos is a sign that the team and Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg have some corrections to make upon the postseason’s arrival in the first week of November.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79234\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-23/gauchos-endure-worst-home-loss-in-more-than-25-years/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79234\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-23/gauchos-endure-worst-home-loss-in-more-than-25-years/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-23/gauchos-endure-worst-home-loss-in-more-than-25-years/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-23/gauchos-endure-worst-home-loss-in-more-than-25-years/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-23/gauchos-endure-worst-home-loss-in-more-than-25-years/","id":1383,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1382,1381,1380],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Soccer Ends Season With 1-1 Tie Versus Blue-Green Rival Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/HallieBrown_WSoc_vsUCI-20171001-08-print.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/HallieBrown_WSoc_vsUCI-20171001-08-print.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos finish the season with a 6-8-5 overall, 2-4-2 conference record.

The defender knocked in her first goal of the year off of Colby Parker’s corner kick, and the moment was even more special as it was her last game as a Gaucho.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rest of the first half played out evenly for both sides, although UCSB did get off many more shots than Cal Poly a number of quality shots for both squads were pretty equal and the goalkeepers for both squads had to make multiple saves to keep their teams alive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The physical nature of the Blue-Green rivalry also was present in the first half, even if it was the Gauchos who were often the aggressors (they doubled Cal Poly’s foul count in the first half 8-4) both squads had plenty of hard challenges that contributed to the chippy atmosphere.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mustangs must have taken the physicality to heart as they came out guns blazing in the second half, and found the mark in the 47th minute of the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again it was a senior scoring in her last game, except this time it was midfielder Emily Hansen who knocked in the game-tying goal after Brittney Rogers couldn’t corral a Cal Poly freekick.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB dominated the half, however, tallying seven shots to Cal Poly’s one the Gauchos were operating at a high level on the offensive end for the last 40 minutes of the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They weren’t able to put one shot past Mustang goalkeeper Sophie Brown however as the sophomore had a stellar half, stopping four shots in the half itself and totaling nine on the day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The saves didn’t seem to affect the Gauchos who continued to attack the Cal Poly goal until the very last minute of regulation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going into the first overtime not much changed for the Gauchos while Cal Poly brought three pairs of fresh legs in. It was UCSB who looked like they had a boost of energy however as they put three shots on goals in the first overtime period, and if not for the heroics of Brown they almost certainly would have ended up winning the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The keeper made the three saves, however, and neither team took a shot in the second overtime period leading to the 1-1 tie.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this wasn’t the result the Gauchos hoped for coming into their season finale, the game actually provided a lot of positives going into the offseason. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The play of Christine Maurer continues to be a shining spot as the freshman showed countless times this year that she has potential to be a top player in the league in the coming years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The great defense that the team played on Sunday also was emblematic of how good UCSB has been defensively to end the year. Although the result wasn’t everything the Gauchos wanted it to be, they played hard and played great soccer, which fittingly is a good analogy for how the 2017-18 season went.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Entering Wednesday, two matches remain on the Gauchos’ schedule. Now, much more is on the line as UCSB is not only trying to defend its home turf, but is also fighting for the No. 1 seed in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Coming off a 5-0 loss to current first place UC Davis, Santa Barbara currently sits in second place with 14 points in the Big West Northern division standings. Following closely behind with 13 points is third place Sacramento State, who recently routed Cal Poly last weekend by a score of 5-1.</p>\n<p>Wednesday will be the second meeting between the Gauchos and Hornets this season. Both teams initially faced each other last Wednesday at Hornet Field, which resulted in a 2-1 OT win for UCSB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For the majority of the first match, both teams were knotted at one goal apiece. In the end, the Gauchos came out on top and handed the Hornets their third loss of their conference schedule.</p>\n<p>Following their collapse against the Aggies over the weekend, the Gauchos’ defensive line will need to clean up its play to put themselves in the best position to possibly win. UCSB will be forced to keep its head on a swivel against a Hornets’ offense that is potent on the offensive end. Sac State currently boasts 11 different scorers on the year, who have combined for a total of 26 goals. In comparison, the Gauchos only have seven different scorers on the team and a combined total of 17 goals.</p>\n<p>More specifically, UCSB’s defensive agenda should have the names of Sac State’s two most productive players – Christian Webb and Justin Bedig – circled on its radar. Midfielder/forward Christian Webb currently still stands as his team’s leading goal scorer with six goals.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bedig found himself doing both scoring and playmaking last week with a goal and assist for his team. Both players will enter Wednesday still with a hot hand approach, as the UCSB defense, led by freshman goalkeeper Alan Carillo, will hope to prevent the two from having many scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>As much as a defensive battle, UCSB’s offense will look for a repeat performance from its last time out against Sac State. In the 2-1 OT victory, it was freshman forward Rodney Michael’s moment as he notched both goals, including the golden goal, to lead the Gauchos to their victory.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it’ll be up to the playmaking abilities of sophomore Ignacio Tellechea and senior defender Randy Mendoza, in addition to the hopeful return of sophomore forward Noah Billingsley who was absent in the Gauchos’ lopsided loss, that will be influential factors upon UCSB’s chance of winning in its final bout at Harder Stadium. All three players have contributed to a combined total of seven team assists on the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will host the visiting Sac State Hornets this Wednesday, Oct. 25 at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79281\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-25/ucsb-attempts-season-sweep-over-sac-st-in-final-home-match/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79281\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-25/ucsb-attempts-season-sweep-over-sac-st-in-final-home-match/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-25/ucsb-attempts-season-sweep-over-sac-st-in-final-home-match/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-25/ucsb-attempts-season-sweep-over-sac-st-in-final-home-match/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-25/ucsb-attempts-season-sweep-over-sac-st-in-final-home-match/","id":1384,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1383,1382,1381],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
