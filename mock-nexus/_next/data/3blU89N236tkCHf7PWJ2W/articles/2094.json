","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Hello Gauchos! To all returning students, welcome back. To all our new Gauchos, welcome to Santa Barbara. I may be slightly biased, but UCSB really is the best. My three years here thus far have been memorable in so many ways.</p>\n<p>One reason for this, of course, is because of its sports. I’m now entering my fourth year with the <em>Nexus</em> as a writer and my second as an editor, so I’ve covered most of the sports here. We may not be a sports powerhouse, but we’re still DI and have some spectacular teams.</p>\n<p>Our men’s water polo team is currently ranked No. 6. The men’s basketball team features the Preseason Big West Player of the Year Alan Williams and the women’s basketball team has reached the postseason for the past two seasons. Our baseball team made the NCAA Tournament last year too. I could go on and on, but trust me, there’s something for everyone.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For those of you concerned that there is no football, I promise you won’t mind. We have real fútbol (a.k.a. soccer), and it’s absolutely fantastic. UCSB isn’t known as soccer heaven for nothing. Last year, the team was ranked as highly as No. 3 in the nation.</p>\n<p>So go to the first game of the year tomorrow against Stanford and give it a try. My first ever soccer game as a freshman was against UCLA. UCSB won 2-0 in a tremendous upset in front of what was basically a sold-out crowd. We set the NCAA record for attendance at a soccer game with 15,896 people, the majority throwing tortillas in celebration. It is one of my favorite memories at UCSB, so I’d love to see all incoming students have a similar experience.</p>\n<p>As for a bit about me, I am a communication major, Spanish minor who would love to turn sports journalism into a career. All my life, sports have been my thing. Most girls have celebrities or pictures of friends on their bedroom walls; I have pictures of basketball players.</p>\n<p>Personally, I think basketball is the best sport on the planet. Whether it’s playing, watching or writing it, men or women, pro, college or any other level, I love this game.</p>\n<p>Coming from the Sac Town area, my favorite team is the Sacramento Kings. I’m extremely excited to see what they do in what’s been deemed a new era. Also, all of you should know that while I currently reside in Laker territory, there’s no saying I love more than ‘beat LA.’</p>\n<p>What makes me different than most basketball fans, and sports fans in general though, is that I prefer the women’s game. I’m currently glued to the television right now with the WNBA playoffs in full swing.</p>\n<p>I grew up playing a bunch of sports year-round, but my dream was always to play in the WNBA. When I realized that wasn’t going to happen, I figured if I couldn’t play for them, I’d write for them.</p>\n<p>And with my love for sports, it didn’t take long for me to fall in love with sports writing. I wrote my first sports piece at 14, and with every article, I fall more and more deeply in love. As tough as it can be putting the sports section together at 1 a.m. sometimes, I do truly adore my job. Plus, I’m extremely proud to say I’m part of a college paper that is ranked No. 9 in the U.S.</p>\n<p>So Gauchos, if you’re a sports lover like me, come see us. Challenge our articles online or, even better, come write for us. Otherwise, I’ll see you tomorrow at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Have a great year,</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Kristen</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of September 26, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52053\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52053\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome/","id":2094,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[2093,2092,2091],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Zion Solomon for Associated Students President","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-04-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/zions_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/zions_Sanya-Kamidi_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Daily Nexus endorses Zion Solomon to serve as the next A.S.

Senate. It seems Solomon has a resolution on the table nearly every week, if not every other week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir drafted three resolutions during her entire term as a senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon cited their primary reason for running is because they genuinely wanted to help students, and because, having been engaged in so many spaces on campus, they understand what students need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon firmly believes in the term “trickle-up social justice,” which they explained as helping the most marginalized, vulnerable people on campus: “the people who have their voices silenced the most.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Solomon’s resume sprawls all over campus – they have worked in Ortega Dining Commons, the Davidson Library, the UCen Bookstore, the A.S. Cashiers and Ticket Office and beyond. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, their most prominent role came in being the A.S. Finance and Business Chair, during which they kept track of nearly $15 million dollars in student fees while also holding an unwavering commitment to transparency through weekly graphics that showed students exactly where student fees go. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon has also reached outside of the senatorial role to organize the Trans Joy Take Over, a survivor solidarity event, and worked hard to promote the A.S. Book Bank in order to help students who may otherwise not be able to afford textbooks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve seen so many aspects of student life, I feel like that makes me very equipped and qualified,” they said in their interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I kept telling students this year, this is your money. A.S. needs to be less of an elitist thing, it takes work from people within it to share with people out of it and people who don’t know very much about it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their proudest moment as senator came when they drafted a resolution supporting the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/chancellor-yang-promises-fulfillment-of-multiple-bsu-demands/\">Black Student Union Demands</a> and were able to see the tangible change being made for Black students on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a senatorial candidate in Spring Quarter 2018, Solomon centered their platform on mental health education, pushing for decreased wait times at Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this goal was not nearly unique at the time, Solomon won the most “first” votes out of any other on-campus senator during the Spring Quarter 2018 elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They have further solidified relationships with UCSB administration, working with Vice Chancellor for Students Affairs Margaret Klawunn to lower the fee waiver for students who have been charged in the College Alcohol and Substance Education (C.A.S.E.) program, as well as supporting former A.S.

It’s a serious issue… students were put in really bad financial situations because of the C.A.S.E. fee and sometimes it was just because they were caught with alcohol in a dorm or just very minor things when the real issue is actually binge drinking.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon also has a self-described “working relationship” with the Office of Financial Aid, putting on workshops with them and becoming familiar with the department’s director.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They further spoke to their attendance of conferences, noting they have a “really good network” at UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz. They have learned from those campuses and their student governments with the aim of making UC Santa Barbara’s A.S. better. </span></p>\n<p><b>GOALS IF ELECTED: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It appears Solomon has not forgotten the C.A.P.S. goal that they ran on as a senatorial candidate, as Solomon noted in their interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that, if elected, they want to continue to push for more funding for C.A.P.S., along with a dozen other agenda items, which include: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supporting the Black Student Union Demands;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working to make textbooks more affordable; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating UC-wide coalitions between student activists and student leaders; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pushing the UC President, Janet Napolitano, to make sure students’ voices are heard; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a peer mentor program with the Office of the President, in which students would be more informed about their financial aid and advising options;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing to put out surveys to gauge students’ needs;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expanding the A.S.

We were disappointed when Solomon did not fully respond to our question about the tweet and a question about a judicial council case they were involved in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They did, however, admit that the tweet was a “momentary lapse” in judgement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, Solomon said they would not use their private social media accounts for A.S. and political business. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second point of concern with Solomon’s candidacy – and one that gave the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> pause when discussing endorsements – was the fact that they deceived the student body during Fall Quarter 2018 by not living amongst their constituents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During their interview with the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Solomon admitted to living off campus during Fall Quarter 2018, a possible violation of their term as an on-campus senator – an offense that fellow On-Campus Senator Yasamin Salari was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-26/judicial-council-unanimously-votes-to-remove-a-s-senator-salari/\">removed from her position for</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They spoke candidly about their situation, citing financial struggles as the reason. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the beginning of the year and throughout the summer, I could not afford to live anywhere. So I didn’t have a lease… anywhere fall quarter,” Solomon said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon added that they did tell Internal Vice President Steven Ho about the situation; however, the fact remains that their constituents did not know. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was living with a friend until I could afford to pay for winter and spring [quarters]. And I’m in a pretty bad place financially. I was trying to save up money.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon said the reason they didn’t speak about the issue publicly at the time is because they did not want “the additional burden” that came with the publicity that Salari had experienced. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> acknowledges that Solomon’s deception was troubling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, given Solomon’s ability to be candid and open with us now, combined with the financial hardships that they had faced, we do not believe this should affect the student body’s decision on who to choose as the president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus’ </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">specific concerns, we fully recognize Solomon’s cracks as a candidate are far and few compared to their successes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon has created change in every corner of this campus. Even those not involved in A.S. circles – which are admittedly rather insulated – know Solomon as someone who has accomplished a lot in their short time at UCSB, a fact the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found as we were deciding who to endorse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon is a current second year, and while we realize that having a third-year A.S. president is a bit unorthodox, they appear to be naturally suited for the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are open about their struggles and their qualifications, and aren’t afraid to take on the realities of the job – they noted that their identity as a queer, Black person helps them to understand the struggle of all students, particularly marginalized ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their interview, Solomon put it aptly: “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most marginalized people [on campus] experience all the bugs in a system, like all the things going wrong with the association or the university… We’re able to feel it the most and then we’re able to advocate for them and make this university better in a way that benefits every single student on this campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As echoed before, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">believes that either Solomon or Sir would serve the school well; no matter who takes home a victory on the night of April 25, our school will be in good hands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the fact remains: our choice is Solomon – we have faith in them to not only do the job required if elected, but to also go above and beyond to advocate for UCSB students at every possible level. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Daily Nexus Editorial Board is comprised of the editor in chief and the news team.</span></i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the April 18, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Bike Committee worked with Bike Committee Senate Liaison and On-Campus Senator Yash Nagpal to develop the resolution.</p>\n<p>The resolution includes a letter written by the Associated Students (A.S.) Bike Committee, which oversees maintenance of campus bicycle infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The letter criticizes the lack of bicycle parking and infrastructure in the newest design plan for the Student Resource Building (SRB) North Landscaping Design Project. The development plan for the lawn area north of the SRB and south of the bike path would provide more space in the SRB and expand outdoor study space, according to the letter.</p>\n<p>Wednesday’s vote is in solidarity with the A.S. Bike Committee’s letter, and directs the SRB Governance Board to consider their request to put the project on hold until the design includes improvements to the SRB’s bicycle system.</p>\n<p>The resolution emphasizes how the current bicycle parking situation at the SRB threatens the safety of the campus. Because the bicycle parking lot for the Theater and Dance West building is across the bike path, accessing the SRB is “challenging and dangerous during peak hours,” according to the letter.</p>\n<p>The letter also stated that current parking “poses a potential congestion problem if either building facility receive greater traffic than usual, which happens every time a major event is held in either space.”</p>\n<p>The Bike Committee first became involved with the North Landscaping Design Project in Spring Quarter 2017, and worked with the SRB Governance Board to add bike parking to their original design.</p>\n<p>“The [previous] design included space for approximately 35 bike parking spaces near the SRB main entrance. This space has been eliminated in the most recent proposal, and the Bike Committee hopes that it will be added back in,” A.S. Bike Committee Chair Annie Golay said to the Nexus.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Student Life and SRB Governance Board Advisor Kim Equinoa said the changes sacrificed more bike parking for programming and study space.</p>\n<p>“The scope was narrowed to include one design area encompassing the grass area north of SRB and south of the bike path. In that transition, the space was designed to maximize programming and study space,” Equinoa said to the Nexus.</p>\n<p>When the A.S. Bike Committee found out the newest design plan did not include new bike space, they wrote a letter directly to the SRB Governance Board detailing why new bike parking is necessary for the SRB.</p>\n<p>“Currently, students who wish to go to the Student Resource Building must park in the bike lot adjacent to the Theater and Dance West building. This poses a potential congestion problem if either building facility receive greater traffic than usual, which happens every time a major event is held in either space,” the letter states.</p>\n<p>In response to the resolution, Equinoa said “the SRB Governance Board is open to receiving any feedback and information that can help inform decisions.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
