On the offensive end, the two are tied for third in the Big West in hits, recording 289 on the season. The Gauchos and Matadors also go one and two, respectively, in at bats this season.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB features a more balanced attack with three players with over 20 runs and four players that have fit four home runs this season.</p>\n<p>One player hitting extremely well this year has been freshman leftfielder Kristen Clark. Leading off for the Gauchos, Clark leads the Big West in hits with 62 on the year. She’s also hit four triples and ranks first in conference with a .431 batting average.</p>\n<p>“She’s definitely taken on a big role,” Pilpil said. “She had to fill in the spot of Jessica Soria [from last year] at the top, so she’s doing a really good job and working hard. Even though she’s a freshman, a lot of people look to her as one of our most consistent players. We expect her to come through and she’s been doing a really good job.”</p>\n<p>CSUN will look to the offensive prowess of freshman first baseman Taylor Glover. Up second in the rotation, she ranks third in conference in runs at 29, second in hits with 52 and is tied for first in triples with five on the year. Glover also tops the Big West in RBI with 35 and is the third-best in slugging percentage at .618.</p>\n<p>Where the Matadors may have the edge is in the circle. As a team, Northridge ranks second in the league in hits, giving up just 6.36 per game, as well as in ERA at 2.67.</p>\n<p>Leading the pitching staff is junior Brianna Elder, who holds an impressive 17-6 record on the year and ranks second in the Big West with a 1.89 ERA. After giving up just one earned run in 14 innings last weekend in CSUN’s series over UC Davis, Elder was named Big West Pitcher of the Week.</p>\n<p>However, junior pitcher Jordan Sauceda could also cause problems for UCSB as she ranks third in the conference in ERA at 2.62.</p>\n<p>“We need to score more runs,” junior pitcher Shelby Wisdom said. “We didn’t score that high last weekend, so we want to score one run an inning, so seven runs a game. What we’ve been working on is getting the leadoff hitter on base and then bunting her over. And then the next batter is going to hit behind her and score her and we’re going to continue doing that.”</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, Wisdom will also be given the pitching responsibilities. She ranks second in innings pitched in the Big West this season and has an ERA of 3.20. As a staff, Santa Barbara holds the second-best strikeout-to-walk ratio in the conference at 1.6.</p>\n<p>“I’m working on throwing more strikes and spinning the ball,” Wisdom said. “Last weekend, I couldn’t find the strike zone, so what I need to do is find the umpire’s strike zone and pitch to the umpire’s strikes and not what I think the strike zone is.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will play in a double-header Saturday before finishing off the series Sunday. Game one is set for Saturday at noon at Matador Diamond.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of April 10, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54761\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-try-to-move-up-conference-standings-against-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54761\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-try-to-move-up-conference-standings-against-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-try-to-move-up-conference-standings-against-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-try-to-move-up-conference-standings-against-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-try-to-move-up-conference-standings-against-csun/","id":1056,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1055,1054,1053],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Host Rival Cal Poly, Try to Snap Losing Streak","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Softball_DustinHarris.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Softball_DustinHarris.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Entering this weekend, the Gauchos have lost five straight games.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>All it takes is one loss to cause a slippery slope for any team.</p>\n<p>After getting off to its best start in program history, the UCSB softball team dropped another game yesterday, falling 8-1 to Oregon State.</p>\n<p>The loss marks the fifth straight for the Gauchos, which drop to 21-15 overall while remaining 1-2 in Big West play.

\r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s the blue-green rivalry and the second week of conference, and I’m mostly proud of how they came back after we basically got it handed to us the first game,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “They made the choice to come back, compete and fight back.”</p>\n<p>With the series victory, the Gauchos improve to 23-16 overall and 3-3 in conference. The Mustangs drop to 21-14 overall and 3-3 in the Big West. Both Santa Barbara and Cal Poly move into a three-way tie for fourth place in the conference standings, along with Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>In yesterday’s rubber match, UCSB earned the 2-1 victory thanks to two runs from freshman leftfielder Kristen Clark. In a game that featured just seven hits combined from both teams, the Gauchos crossed home plate first in the opening inning when sophomore catcher MeShalon Moore hit a sacrifice fly to bring Clark home.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly responded in the second inning, but Santa Barbara broke the stalemate in the fifth inning to score the winning run. Clark advanced to first base on a fielder’s choice to third base before stealing second. Then, junior right fielder DeJanee Moore floated the ball just over the head of the first baseman to score Clark and give UCSB the series victory 2-1.</p>\n<p>“We had better quality at bats,” Galicinao said. “We only had three hits, so it was a matter of working longer at bats and forcing the pitcher to throw more pitches. We had a few walks and got a couple key hits, and that’s what it takes in our game sometimes. We were able to find a way to push them across. It was enough.”</p>\n<p>Junior pitcher Shelby Wisdom earned the victory in the circle, improving to 11-11 on the year. While reigning Big West Pitcher of the Week freshman Sierra Hyland suffered the loss, dropping to 18-6, she gave up just three hits and struck out eight in her six innings of play.</p>\n<p>“[Hyland’s] good. Obviously she’s been doing a really good job,” Galicinao said. “As much as you don’t like having [her] against you, it’s also exciting to see a talent like that come through the ranks.”</p>\n<p>In game two of Saturday’s double-header, UCSB snapped a six-game losing streak that continued through game one, winning 2-0.</p>\n<p>Despite being outhit 7-5, the Gauchos took advantage of their opportunities offensively. Both runs came in the fourth inning due to poor defense from Cal Poly. MeShalon Moore walked, senior second baseman Kathryn Pilpil was hit by a pitch and senior first baseman Lauren Boser reached first base on an error.</p>\n<p>As a result, the Mustangs made a pitching change, but it did not matter. Freshman shortstop Emily Brucelas was walked to score Moore in the winning run of the day and sophomore leftfielder Jessica Tetzlaff singled, scoring Pilpil to secure the victory.</p>\n<p>Clark led the offense for Santa Barbara, hitting 3-4. Meanwhile, Wisdom earned the win in the circle, earning the shutout while striking out three.</p>\n<p>“[Saturday’s win] was really big,” Clark said. “We were feeling a little bit down and frustrated, but to come out and shut them down was really good for us and I think it carried into [yesterday] too.”</p>\n<p>Game one on Saturday was a completely different story. Falling 14-1, UCSB failed to contain a Cal Poly squad known more for its defense than its offense.</p>\n<p>Eleven different Mustangs scored runs as Cal Poly scored at least one run in six of the seven innings, capped off by six runs in the seventh. Cal Poly also outhit UCSB 15-3.</p>\n<p>“The first game, I couldn’t find the strike zone,” Wisdom said. “They were outhitting us and we couldn’t get the ball in play. We couldn’t hit strikes and we were swinging at balls.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ lone run of the day came from Boser in the fourth. With her on first base, DeJanee Moore doubled to left-center, which was enough to bring Boser over home plate.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s young phenom earned the win in the circle, as Hyland allowed just one run on three hits and struck out seven batters in her five innings of play.</p>\n<p>“It felt like everything went to them and nothing was working our way,” Clark said. “We got all their best in that game.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will be on the road the next two weekends, taking on Cal State Northridge next weekend.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 7, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54681\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/ucsb-comes-atop-blue-green-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54681\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/ucsb-comes-atop-blue-green-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/ucsb-comes-atop-blue-green-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/ucsb-comes-atop-blue-green-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/ucsb-comes-atop-blue-green-rivalry/","id":1054,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1053,1052,1051],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Defeated Twice by No. 16 Oregon","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SoftballAnnaKodelashvili.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SoftballAnnaKodelashvili.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After beginning the season with the best start in program history, the Gauchos have now lost four straight games.

Both teams scored one more run, the Ducks in the sixth inning and the Gauchos in the seventh, but Santa Barbara couldn’t find the offense to avoid its second loss of the day 10-4.</p>\n<p>After falling behind early, UCSB outplayed Oregon the second half of the game. Sophomore pitcher Ashley Ludlow anchored the Gauchos defensively, giving up just two hits and striking out four in her 4.2 innings of play.
