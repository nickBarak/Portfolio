said.</p>\n<p>“That’s what makes us a nationally ranked newspaper and that’s what’s going to keep us serving this community in the best way we possibly can — the passion, honesty and ability of the students at the <i>Nexus</i>.”</p>\n<p>The judges wrote that <i>DailyNexus.com</i> “excelled with a clean and well-organized home page, strong navigation tools and a wide variety of content,” adding, “An easy-to-use search tool helps find stories as far back as 2000.”</p>\n<p><i>Nexus </i>Copy Chief Simone Dupuy won best headline portfolio for what judges wrote was a good mix of “inventive and informative heads.” The headlines included “<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/waive-goodbye-to-your-financial-aid/\" target=\"_blank\">Waive Goodbye to Your Financial Aid</a>” and “<a

Amputation is a fairly common event in response to meningococcal infections.”</p>\n<p>Shane Yen, second-year pre-biology major and one of many students waiting in line to get a vaccination last Friday at the Health Center, said he was looking forward to receiving the vaccination.</p>\n<p>“I usually don’t look forward to getting shots,” Yen said. “But when you’ve got a deadly infection like meningitis, which could potentially kill you, I’m actually really eager to get this shot. It’s better to be safe than sorry.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Robinson provided tips for students to stay safe and prevent catching the disease and encouraged students to get the vaccine as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>“The most important way to prevent this infection is to get the vaccine — that’s number one,” Robinson said. “Other than that, avoid people who are sick, try not to share secretions and be aware in overcrowded situations.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Robinson said the disease is contracted in social settings, which makes it especially important for college students to get the vaccine.</p>\n<p>“In times when there are outbreaks, visiting bars, drinking alcohol and smoking are also risk factors for catching it,” Robinson said. “But by far, the most important thing is to get the vaccine.”</p>\n<p>According to Dr. Robinson, the vaccine’s most common side effect is soreness at the injection site. Others can include fever, headaches and rare muscle aches, but these conditions are “a whole lot better than losing your life.”</p>\n<p>“The saddest thing as an infectious disease specialist is to see a young, intelligent, perfectly healthy student die or become maimed from this infection, when I know that it is preventable with a simple shot,” Dr. Robinson said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68465\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/student-health-provides-meningitis-b-vaccine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68465\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/student-health-provides-meningitis-b-vaccine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/student-health-provides-meningitis-b-vaccine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/student-health-provides-meningitis-b-vaccine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/student-health-provides-meningitis-b-vaccine/","id":2536,"author":{"id":114,"name":"Hubert Zhang"},"related":[2535,2534,2533],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dance Marathon Raises Money for Children’s Hosptial","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marthon-2016_by-Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Students participated in a full 12 hours of dancing, games and activities to raise money for Cottage Children's Hospital in UCSB’s third annual Dance Marathon on Saturday from noon to midnight in Ro...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_68504\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68504\" data-attachment-id=\"68504\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/dance-marathon-raises-money-for-childrens-hosptial/dance-marathon-attendees-are-guided-in-a-stretch-by-the-emcees/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marathon-_-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dance Marathon 2016\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marathon-_-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marathon-_-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-68504\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dance-Marathon-_-Stephen-Manga-1-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Dance marathon attendees are guided in a stretch by the emcees.

Although they organize fundraisers year-round, the 12-hour Dance Marathon event is the organization’s largest and most well-known event.

We want to set a good precedent for our future Dance Marathons, because the event is still new to UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Despite not reaching its monetary goal, Dance Marathon maintained a positive outlook, Executive Director and fourth-year biology Lynn Padlipsky said.</p>\n<p>“I was extremely thrilled about how the morale stayed positive the entire time.
