Senate last week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thrower said that the European Traditions requirement has a “bad connotation” and has bothered her since her freshman year, as she believes many classes outside the requirement are often Eurocentric.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been looking into [the European Traditions requirement] more and a lot of schools across the country are getting rid of their requirement,” Thrower said in an interview with the Nexus. “And then we’re the only UC that has a requirement like that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with having the general A-E requirements, UCSB also has two requirements in the context of European history under Special Subject Area requirements: the European Traditions requirement and the World Cultures requirement, which includes classes with a focus on “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one or more culture outside of the European tradition.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The European Traditions requirement, defined as any class pertaining to “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">early and/or modern European cultures and their significance in world affairs” has been in place since the 80s, according to Harold Marcuse, a German history professor in the history department at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Marcuse, the requirement was born out of the World Wars and got a boost by the subsequent Cold War, which was enough to solidify the requirement’s place at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just very Eurocentric,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marcuse, who is assisting Thrower in forming the Academic Senate proposal, had pushed to remove the requirement in 2002. According to Marcuse, the current Area E requirement, known as Culture and Thought, was initially split into two sections —  E1 and E2 — one of which was the Western Civilizations requirement, which he called “outdated.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the recommendations that we had was to completely get rid of that requirement, but there was a fair amount of resistance from a few departments,” Marcuse said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now courses tend to really fill up no matter what. But back then some departments really lived from student enrollments in the courses they offered that fulfilled that area requirement.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to maintain enrollment in those classes, Marcuse said that the Western Civilizations requirement was converted into an add-on requirement, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">now known as the European Traditions requirement, while redefining and updating the various other general education categories and requirements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were also suggestions for an LGBTQ+ and interdisciplinary studies requirements, but both of them failed out of departments’ desire to keep the general education requirements as is, Marcuse added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to change the requirement, Marcuse said there are various paths a proposal would have to take before being considered for implementation. After going through multiple committees — such as the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Committee on Courses and General Education, the Academic Senate and the faculty executive committee — the proposal would have to be vetted by the registrar to determine if it can be implemented, according to Marcuse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After receiving feedback from faculty and administration, the proposal would go into a vote in the faculty legislature, a body that encompasses tenured faculty and representatives from the Academic Senate and has the final say on it, according to Marcuse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Thrower, however, the first step was garnering support from student organizations on campus, including a resolution through the A.S. Senate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution, titled “A Resolution To Abandon the European Traditions Requirement,” was authored by Off-Campus Senators Kimia Hadidi and Adalis Rojas and passed at the Feb. 19 Senate meeting. However, the resolution supports abandoning the requirement, which is separate from Thrower’s proposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Hadidi, a bulk of high school history already revolves around Europe — a redundancy with the European Traditions requirement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we do want to learn about other cultures, we should have that option to do it,” she said, “as opposed to just having a European Traditions where it’s one class, [and] in a World Cultures where it’s another, why not combine the two?” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After gaining the Senate’s approval, Thrower said her next step is to present her proposal to the UCSB Academic Senate on March 12 and focus on other universities across the country who have abandoned their versions of the requirements in favor of a more holistic education.</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Organizers are planning to take a vote next Monday to potentially go on strike at UCSB, if UCSC graduate students are dismissed from teaching positions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an informal poll about the possibility of striking at UCSB with 595 responses, 63% of graduate students who responded said they were “willing to pursue” a full strike if UCSC dismisses graduate student strikers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorin noted during the meeting that these numbers are greater than ones from initial strike polls at UCSC prior to the beginning of their strike, and that more than a quarter of the entire graduate student population had responded to the poll. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COLA organizers said in the meeting that they plan to send out another poll next week to graduate students to assess support of a grading strike or full teaching strike and will meet again on Monday evening for COLA General Assembly.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

us to see what is happening on a larger scale, on the social scale, if we are going to address it,” Hill said. Max Abrams/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her discussion, titled “From Social Movement to Social Impact: Putting an End to Sexual Harassment,” challenged the audience to expand their personal definitions of gender-based violence and emphasized the structural change required to transform the culture around sexual harassment and violence across the U.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara’s Feminist Futures Initiative, which brings together UC Santa Barbara faculty, students and outside speakers to collaborate on interdisciplinary research on gender justice, hosted the event alongside the UCSB Women’s Center and local businesswoman Sara Miller McCune. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier in the afternoon, Hill met with over 30 high school students, undergraduates and graduate students, some of whom are engaged with researching sexual harassment on campus, according to Professor Leila Rupp, associate dean of social sciences, who introduced Hill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“None of the students this afternoon were even born when Dr. Hill gave her courageous and world-altering testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee,” Rupp said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill also spoke at UCSB in 1995, and at the beginning of her speech noted that, after 25 years, it is “hard to imagine we are still in the struggle together.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I realize that it’s been a while since 1991. Some of you are probably wondering, ‘Why didn’t you wear that green suit?’ and some of you are probably wondering, ‘Oh, when’s she gonna start dishing the dirt on the senators?’” she joked to the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Hill did not dwell on her own experiences in the Senate Judiciary Committee and instead focused her speech on the work that still remains after the launch of the #MeToo movement, which reignited the conversation about accountability of those in powerful positions regarding sexual harassment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill noted that her own experiences in the Senate parallel that of Christine Blasey Ford, who in 2017 testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that then-Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when she was in high school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have to understand that what happened to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford should never happen again, but we also have to recognize that it is happening every day to somebody in this country,” Hill told the audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill said that outrage over the Kavanaugh confirmation changed the course of the 2018 midterm election, but that the response from the federal government since then has been lacking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No robust government response to gender-based violence has occurred and in this primary cycle, little or no attention has been given to what many call a moment of reckoning that happened back in 2017,” Hill said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lack of conversation around sexual violence, Hill said, includes current 2020 Democratic primary candidates, who participated in a debate in Nevada on the night of Hill’s speech. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are in another debate tonight and if the history proves to be a reflection of what’s going to happen in the future, those questions are not going to be had,” Hill said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill challenged the audience to expand the way they view gender justice to include not only sexual harassment, but sexual assault, domestic violence, rape and incest. To fully understand the problem of gender-based violence, Hill said that society needs to examine the “bigger picture” of how survivors are treated beyond the specifics of their own experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can relate to the individual stories, but it is just as important for us to see what is happening on a larger scale, on the social scale, if we are going to address it,” Hill said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our solutions have to be multi-dimensional because the impacts of gender-based violence are multi-dimensional. It impacts [people’s] ability in many cases, depending on the nature of the problem, to have housing, to be educated, to live safely in their communities.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill said that the U.S. government has “taken on huge social problems,” such as the opioid crisis, by addressing the problem as a matter of public safety, and that the same approach needs to be taken to address gender-based violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Hill said that this can’t be left to the government to solve alone, that individuals need to also view gender-based violence as a matter of public safety and “problem solve as a community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Do we really believe that abuse that affects one person affects us all? Do we really believe that we are all in this? I’m not sure we do.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One structural change Hill proposed to address gender-based violence is to challenge how society as a whole approaches masculinity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This idea of manliness is curated to make us believe that to be a man you must be emotionally restrained, strong and brave, aggressive and awesome,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[That] is not masculinity, it is abuse.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill also elaborated on what she said is the systematic practice of silencing people who choose to come forward with stories of gender-based violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Believing women to be truthful is consistent with fairness and justice,” she said. “Now all of you believe that, right?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After cheers and applause from the audience, she continued, “We are now in a time where if we say we believe survivors, we are met with the claim that we are denying due process. In other words, due process has been weaponized to silence survivors.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do not support a system that presumes every time a woman testifies about abuse, she is lying. But that is what many of us start with: that she cannot be trusted to tell the truth,” Hill emphasized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill’s testimony against Thomas in 1991 raised complicated questions about the intersectionality of race and gender, she said. Opponents criticized Hill for coming forward, saying she “did a disservice to the Black community by testifying.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To those critics, Hill asked for the trust that she believes all survivors deserve. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the Q&amp;A portion of the event, Hill spoke with UCSB feminist studies graduate students Amoni Thompson and Megan Spencer, answering their questions about her career and life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Responding to a question from Spencer about solidarity with student movements, Hill expressed her support for UC graduate students calling for a cost-of-living adjustment, a movement known as COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Affordable housing is an issue for everyone,” Hill said to audience applause. “Unfortunately, most families have to fight that issue on their own, but our students should not have to fight this battle on their own. Universities should be using their resources to help them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill left the audience with a challenge: No matter how difficult it may be to fully change the culture around gender-based violence, she said, it is just as important now as it was when she first spoke to the Senate in 1991 to fight for structural change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is natural to revert back to the status quo. It’s inevitable. But the problem is so severe, we cannot afford to do that.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 20, 2020 print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Considering the overall magnitude of the team and all the years that rolled by, fans of Philadelphia craved that Vince Lombardi trophy more and more ever since the first inaugural Super Bowl back in 1967.</p>\n<p>Factor in two previous runner-up appearances (third time’s the charm), including a phenomenal 2017-18 season, and then you got the Eagles’ faithful talking about this being their year. Oh, how right they were.</p>\n<p>Before I get into the Super Bowl itself and how ‘pundits’ alike were counting out the Eagles all year long, I’m going to mention a few key moments from both regular and postseason play that stood out that ultimately led up to the completion of the Philadelphia dream as well as football’s greatest underdog tale.</p>\n<p><strong>The Field Goal Heard Around the World</strong></p>\n<p>What a start to the season this was. Carson Wentz had begun to show signs of major second-year progression, the Eagles had seemingly found a No. 1 wide receiver in Alshon Jeffery and that four-headed monster of a defensive line had only just begun its rampage on opposing quarterbacks.</p>\n<p>It was a Week Three divisional matchup at home for the Eagles when the New York Giants came knocking on Philadelphia’s door.</p>\n<p>Thrust early on into desperation mode after conceding the first two matches of the new season, the Giants sought to upset the Eagles in their own backyard and spoil the festivities of what looked to be the start of a promising year.</p>\n<p>It was a back and forth game throughout, but in the final minute of the fourth quarter, the game was tied at 24-24. The Eagles had moved up the field minimally but still had time to get into field goal range before the clock expired.</p>\n<p>On a right side curl route, Wentz found Jeffery for a 27-yard gain who then stepped out of bounds with one second remaining.</p>\n<p>Enter rookie kicker Jake Elliott, who landed the field goal from a franchise record of 61-yards out, earning the Eagles their second win of the season in very memorable fashion.</p>\n<p><strong>A Primetime Performance</strong></p>\n<p>With both teams at a 4-1 overall record, many analysts had the Eagles and Panthers battling for a top-three slot in the weekly power rankings. Luckily, the two teams would go on and face off in a primetime Thursday Night Football matchup.</p>\n<p>This away game would prove to be the hardest meeting for the Eagles this far into the season. With Cam Newton on the rise once more, Philadelphia was the only thing standing in Carolina’s way.</p>\n<p>The match was a hard-fought and close affair as both sides swapped leads several times.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the game came down to stamina as the Eagles’ defensive line completely halted the opposing run game, thus forcing Newton to overthrow and exhaust himself, resulting in a pair of late interceptions that halted all hope for a comeback.</p>\n<p>The Eagles had done it again in the clutch, proving that they were definitely a team to keep an eye on.</p>\n<p><strong>Wentz in a Lifetime</strong></p>\n<p>In the following week, the Eagles would go on to host a divisional Monday Night Football game for the ages against the Redskins. More specifically, Carson Wentz would go on and shred Washington in the air for 268 yards and four touchdowns.</p>\n<p>This standout game for Wentz would prove to be the platform for his potential MVP candidacy.</p>\n<p>Putting on a show all season long, he once again achieved some unbelievable feats by escaping collapsing pockets and making almost impossible throws all across the field.</p>\n<p>Truly, this was the start of something special for the Eagles’ organization and its fans, as talks of a deep playoff run were brewing.</p>\n<p><strong>Star Foles: A New Hope</strong></p>\n<p>Rams versus Eagles, Goff versus Wentz: a great battle in the NFC as well as the NFL Game of the Week at the famous Coliseum.</p>\n<p>At this point in the season, Philadelphia was at the top of the league standings and was just one win away from clinching the NFC East Division title.</p>\n<p>It was perhaps the most thrilling matchup yet — or perhaps I’m just biased because I saw it all go down live in person — as both sides just couldn’t stop scoring.</p>\n<p>Then, tragedy: Wentz goes down with an ACL tear after diving into the end zone in order to hand his team the lead.</p>\n<p>As Philly fans held their breath, they looked to backup quarterback Nick Foles to save the day. He’d go on to do more than just that, as we all know.</p>\n<p>Thus, the start of the Foles era began in the midst of a potentially abrupt end to the season and minute hope for what he could possibly achieve in the playoffs.</p>\n<p><strong>“They’re the Best Defense in the League; You Can’t Win!”</strong></p>\n<p>Thirty-eight total points, that was just how much the Eagles dropped on what pundits proclaimed as, ‘the best defense in the NFL.’</p>\n<p>The Vikings visited Lincoln Financial Field in hopes of earning a one-way ticket to the Super Bowl, which would be held in Minnesota regardless — that is, unless Foles and the Eagles had something to say about it.</p>\n<p>Starting with a pick-six by veteran cornerback Patrick Robinson, the floodgates were opened in Philly as the scores began to rain down on the opposing defense.</p>\n<p>Running backs LeGarrette Blount and Jay Ajayi ground pounded, tight end Zach Ertz caught on third down to move the chains and Foles flung it into the end zone from deep … The Eagles had done it.</p>\n<p>They had finally earned their chance to return to the Super Bowl, this time in hopes of exacting revenge upon a familiar enemy.</p>\n<p><strong>Super Bowl LII: Eagles 41 – Patriots 33</strong></p>\n<p>The previous section’s subheader was a critic’s quote for a reason. I can’t even begin to tell you the number of Eagles nonbelievers that were present in both national coverage and local media.</p>\n<p>You would think after all the counting out going on during the season and through the playoffs that the dialogue would change from “you can’t” to “maybe you can.” Inevitably, the Eagles went on and achieved as the underdogs once more.</p>\n<p>It was Brady, the G.O.A.T., versus Foles, the hope. Early on the Eagles took and maintained the lead.</p>\n<p>Following a pair of field goals on each side, a deep throw from Foles found its way into Jeffery’s control as he made a spectacular catch that resulted into a 34-yard touchdown.</p>\n<p>With a score of 9-3 early in the 2nd quarter, the Patriots would go on to travel all the way down the field until eventually missing on a muffed field goal attempt.</p>\n<p>The Eagles would go on and take advantage of Patriots turnovers on downs and hand the ball to Blount for a 21-yard rushing touchdown and extend their lead to 15-3.</p>\n<p>New England would soon respond after with a made long field goal, interception near the end zone, and a James White rushing touchdown with no extra point after.</p>\n<p>Halftime was on the horizon, but second year head coach Doug Pederson had something special planned for the Patriots on 4th and Goal; the “Philly Special” that is.</p>\n<p>The “Philly Special” play will go down in the Super Bowl history books as one of the best trick plays ever accomplished.</p>\n<p>This formation featured Foles ushering over to the shotgun position as yelled at his offensive line in order to distract New England’s defense.</p>\n<p>The ball was then abruptly snapped to halfback Corey Clement who ran left until he lateral passed possession to tight end Trey Burton.</p>\n<p>All the meanwhile Foles had sneakily walked unmarked into the right side of the goal line, then catching the easy touchdown pass from Burton.</p>\n<p>I’ll be honest, I screamed at the top of my lungs when I saw this entire maneuver get pulled off on the big screen in real-time.</p>\n<p>As the halftime whistle was blown, the Eagles entered the locker room with a lead of 22-12 and were just two full quarters away from the franchise’s biggest victory ever.</p>\n<p>Entering the third, Brady had a point to prove, likely relating to his moniker of ‘the Comeback Kid.’</p>\n<p>He ended the first possession of the new half with a darting touchdown pass to his favorite target in tight end Rob Gronkowski, bringing the score to 19-22. Foles then responded on the following drive with a touchdown pass of his own to Clement and expanded the Eagles’ lead once more to 29-19, but it was still a game that could burst wide open at any second.</p>\n<p>Then, as if the current trend was a surprise to anyone, Brady brought it back to within a score by way of touchdown pass to wide receiver Chris Hogan. The 4th quarter whistle would then bring the game to its most crucial point as time appeared to slow down entirely in this for the most part fast paced game.</p>\n<p>The Eagles started the last quarter of the match with a long field goal kick courtesy of Elliott, Philadelphia lead 32-26.</p>\n<p>On the next drive, Brady knew a touchdown would be enough to earn the Patriots the lead and shift the momentum in his side’s favor.</p>\n<p>Considering this game broke the record for most offensive yards in a Super Bowl back in the 3rd quarter, this possession was no different as Brady had his team travel down the field as he once again delivered a touchdown pass to Gronkowski.</p>\n<p>Down for the first time since the field goal exchange in the first quarter, Foles and the Eagles needed one last feat of skillful endurance as the clock wound down with the score still at 32-33.<br>\nClutch player spoiler, here comes Zach Ertz.</p>\n<p>Following a pair of first-down catches made by Ertz himself, the star tight end went on to catch the game-winning score that put Philadelphia up 38-33 late in the game.</p>\n<p>The two-point conversion failed but that didn’t matter because it was still all hands on deck regardless if the Eagles defense had any chance of stopping Brady and his bunch.</p>\n<p>Then, the greatest defensive play in Eagles history occurred right before everyone’s eyes.</p>\n<p>“Brady gets hit, the ball is out!” yelled play-by-play announcer Kevin Harlan as Philadelphia defensive end Brandon Graham strips possession away from the New England quarterback’s grasp.</p>\n<p>The ball ended up getting recovered by Eagles first-round drafted rookie Derek Barnett and his side was now in prime position to run out the clock and earn their first ever Super Bowl.</p>\n<p>Goosebumps ran rampant on both sides’ fans as each hoped for the best. Ultimately the Patriots would go on to hold the Eagles to only a field goal, but used up all their timeouts in the process.</p>\n<p>With the score at 41-33 and the clock within the final minute of play, the Eagles just needed a single defensive stop on downs.</p>\n<p>Playing deep in their own secondary, the Eagles only allowed Brady to get into a Hail Mary passing range as the whole nation held its breath for the last play of Super Bowl 52.</p>\n<p>They had done it. It was over.</p>\n<p>The Eagles had won.</p>\n<p>The final play resulted in that Hail Mary pass and the obvious target of Gronkowski’s huge frame was covered by six different Eagles cornerbacks.</p>\n<p>As the failed ball fell on the ground, so did all the green confetti.</p>\n<p>It was a night to remember for a new dynasty, and a night to forget for the old dynasty.</p>\n<p>We can all now breathe a sigh of relief Eagles fans; we made it into the circle of champions.</p>\n<p>Hopes were high for this glorious match and hopes will remain high as our team’s future remains bright with the help of both Wentz and Foles, the young and experienced star core on both offense and defense, as well as the coaching and administrative talents involved with the Eagles organization. Now as the offseason approaches and we let this win sink in, all I have to say is one last thing… Go Birds.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Feb. 22</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81405\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/against-all-odds-a-fans-account-of-the-eagles-journey-to-winning-super-bowl-lii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81405\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/against-all-odds-a-fans-account-of-the-eagles-journey-to-winning-super-bowl-lii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/against-all-odds-a-fans-account-of-the-eagles-journey-to-winning-super-bowl-lii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/against-all-odds-a-fans-account-of-the-eagles-journey-to-winning-super-bowl-lii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/against-all-odds-a-fans-account-of-the-eagles-journey-to-winning-super-bowl-lii/","id":1861,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1860,1859,1858],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
