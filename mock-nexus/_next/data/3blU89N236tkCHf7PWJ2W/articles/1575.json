With six seniors graduating, five of them starters, the Gauchos will certainly rely on younger players to elevate the team, especially on the strong class of 11 incoming freshmen next season.</p>\n<p>“We were in a position where we thought we had a really good opportunity to bring in players who could contribute right away because of their level of play, where they played and their ability and talent,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We didn’t feel like we had to venture much into the transfer market. I believe this is the first year where we have a recruiting class that does not have a transfer on it.”</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB adds three forwards, four midfielders, three defenders and a goalkeeper for a recruiting class that is ranked No. 8 in the nation by Top Drawer Soccer.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I’d be excited as a fan of Gaucho soccer. Come see the MLS players today before they show up tomorrow, and you’re going to see a lot of that over the next couple of years,” Vom Steeg said. “Next year’s conference freshman of the year will come from this recruiting class.”</p>\n<p><strong>Forwards</strong></p>\n<p>Highlighting the forward class is Sacramento native Dalton Pando, who played club ball with the San Jose Earthquake Academy of the USSF. Pando was ranked No. 50 in Top Drawer Soccer’s top 150 academy players while also receiving the rank of No. 19 forward in the nation and No. 4 player from Northern California Region.</p>\n<p>Also coming from the San Jose Earthquake Academy is forward Alex Liua. The Los Altos native paired with Pando to form a dangerous attack for the Earthquake and will look to continue that next season for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Rounding out the forwards is Denis Kalamar of Seattle. Kalamar played for the Seattle Sounders Academy for three years and received a Top Drawer Soccer No. 10 ranking in the Pacific Northwest Region for his play.</p>\n<p>“I think a player like Adonis, like Kalamar, Pando, those are attacking players that can go onto a field and change it,” Vom Steeg said. “Alex is another player who attacks. Any of the guys who attack will have an opportunity to play for us next year.”</p>\n<p><strong>Midfielders</strong></p>\n<p>Three players from the L.A. Galaxy Academy headline the midfield group of the Gauchos’ recruiting class. Adonis Amaya is the highest rated prospect coming in for the Gauchos as he received a No. 15 academy rating, No. 5 midfielder rating and a No. 4 rating in the Southern California Region. Amaya played defender for the U-17 U.S. National team and forward for the Galaxy.</p>\n<p>Fellow Galaxy Academy player Axel Mendez joins the Gauchos as the No. 32 ranked prospect out of the Southern California Region, according to Top Drawer Soccer. Mendez brings an attacking style of play to the midfield position for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The first player that we got to commit from this whole group was actually Axel Mendez,” Vom Steeg said. “Axel is unique to us because we haven’t really had a playmaker out of midfield. He has a real opportunity to contribute right away because of the position he plays.”</p>\n<p>Ryo Fujii also comes from the Galaxy Academy ranking No. 147 in the nation from the USSF Academy system. Fujii, a native of Torrance also ranks No. 21 in Southern California and is the No. 51 midfielder in the nation.</p>\n<p>Ludwig Ahl is one of two international prospects in this season’s recruiting class hailing from Stockholm, Sweden. Ahl played for AIK Stockholm in Sweden’s top amateur league and was considered for the Swedish National Team.</p>\n<p>“In the past, you’d be lucky to find one freshman starting at UCSB,” Vom Steeg said. “Next year, there’s a chance that we can have eight or nine freshman or sophomores starting on the field. I would be really surprised if at least three freshman didn’t start for us next year.”</p>\n<p><strong>Defenders</strong></p>\n<p>The other international player is Julian Busch from Eichenau, Germany where he played for 1860 Munich. Busch played in the U-17 Bundesliga, the top amateur league in Germany against formidable competition from all over Europe.</p>\n<p>“We feel like the international players are a little more mature,” Vom Steeg said. “Those are players that you think can contribute right away because they’re 20 (years old) and once again they have played at a high level.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will add a bit of east coast flair in Dugan Zier of New York. Zier played for the New York Red Bulls Academy and is one of eight USSF Academy players in the Gauchos recruiting class.</p>\n<p>The fourth and final player hailing from the Galaxy Academy is Jeff Quezada. Quezada was team captain for the Galaxy Academy during his time there and played alongside the trio of midfielders in addition to current UCSB players Josh McNeely and Drew Murphy. All six players won a USSF National Title with the Galaxy Academy in 2011.</p>\n<p>“We’re really high on Jeff Quezada. He’s got the respect of his team, he’s the captain of one of the top teams in the country, but again, he plays a really difficult position,” Vom Steeg said. “He’s going to have a great career here at UCSB, but because of the position he plays, there’s a big, huge learning curve there.”</p>\n<p><strong>Goalkeeper</strong></p>\n<p>Brandon Berke of De Anza Force SC rounds out the Gauchos’ recruiting class. Berke will most likely play backup to McNeely this season but provides the Gauchos with solid depth at the goalkeeper position.</p>\n<p>With 11 new players joining an already talented and young squad, the Gauchos look to have a bright future atop the Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>“We’ve really recruited the right type of kids with the right attitudes. I can’t say enough about these players that had the opportunity to go elsewhere; not only other colleges but obviously [they] do what they really want to do at some point, which is be a pro player, but instead they chose to play here at UCSB,” Vom Steeg said. “That is the attitude that will take us really far because I think players will be really committed to the team and committed to having a successful season.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 15, 2014’s print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55294\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/staying-atop-the-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55294\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/staying-atop-the-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/staying-atop-the-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/staying-atop-the-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/staying-atop-the-big-west/","id":1575,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1574,1573,1572],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[254,318,354,366,518,519,527,533,535,538,539,546,548,551,554,555,558,561,567,570,574,576,577,578,589,592,594,596,605,609,613,618,623,630,633,638,640,647,650,651,653,654,656,660,661,668,670,673,677,683,694,700,703,706,708,710,717,719,724,727,798,809,814,828,833,847,849,851,853,854,856,857,858,863,867,868,870,874,877,879,880,882,884,886,887,889,892,894,899,900,902,904,905,915,920,1259,1565,1566,1567,1568,1569,1570,1571,1575,1578,1581,1583,1584,1587,1590,1591,1594,1599,1601,1603,1606,1607,1608,1611,1623,1626,1652,1666,1668,1669,1670,1674,1675,1685,1689,1691,1692,1697,1762,1763,1765,2063,2069,2095,2142,2158,3169,3185,3190,3226,3229,3231,3232,3238,3244,3249,3256,4448,4494,4522,4523,4524,4526,4531,4539,4541,4544,4545,4546,4549,4550,4551,4554,4567,5189,5193,5194,5209,5396,5399,5400,5402,5403,5404,5405,5406,5407,5409,5417,5418,5419,5420,5421,5422,5423,5424,5425,5426,5427,5428,5429,5430,5431,5436,5448,5449,5450,5502,5530,5536],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Hosts Westmont in Preseason Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.25.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-vs.-Cal-Poly-SLO-Peter-Vandenbelt-20.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.25.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-vs.-Cal-Poly-SLO-Peter-Vandenbelt-20.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos begin preseason play with a home game against Westmont.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s soccer team seems optimistic as it kicks off the preseason tomorrow by hosting Westmont.</p>\n<p>In the 2013 season, the Gauchos finished with an overall record of 9-9-1 and a conference record of 3-5.

Ritter played in 16 games during the 2013 season, allowing only 12 goals and saving an impressive 82.6 percent of shots.</p>\n<p>“We expect a solid defensive performance with a shutout this game,” Ritter said. “We are really excited to build upon what we did last year.”</p>\n<p>With such impressive goalkeeping, UCSB will look to their offense to play a huge factor in adding wins. Senior Madison Beckley will be a crucial offensive weapon as she tied for the team lead in goals last season with five. Junior Angelisa Cortez and sophomore Morgan Idso will also look to make a big impact as they recorded a combined 5 goals and two assists in 2013.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ offense will have to be ready to take full advantage as Westmont comes into this exhibition with a relatively inexperienced goalkeeper in junior Lauren Dorr. Dorr faced a total of only seven shots last year and has only started one game in her Westmont career.</p>\n<p>However, this match won’t be anything to take lightly as Westmont possesses a trio of returning strikers that combined for a total of 18 goals and seven assists last season. Junior forward Kelsey Steck led the team with eight goals and one assist in the 2013 season as Westmont managed to outscore their opponents by a tally of 51 to 13.</p>\n<p>Following the loss of three top defenders after the 2013 season, the Gauchos will look to their younger players to step up and stop this high-powered Westmont offense. Leading the defensive core will be senior center back Miranda Cornejo who started 13 games last season.</p>\n<p>“A big change this year is that we have a deep bench with the addition of 10 new freshman,” Ritter said. “This will be key to winning more games because if somebody gets hurt then our bench will be able to step up.”</p>\n<p>The exhibition is set to kick off tomorrow at Harder Stadium at 7 P.M.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55974\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-15/ucsb-hosts-westmont-in-preseason-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55974\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-15/ucsb-hosts-westmont-in-preseason-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-15/ucsb-hosts-westmont-in-preseason-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-15/ucsb-hosts-westmont-in-preseason-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-15/ucsb-hosts-westmont-in-preseason-opener/","id":1574,"author":{"id":66,"name":"Martin Cobos"},"related":[1573,1572,1571],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Brings in 10 Talented Freshmen for Next Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/10.6.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-2.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/10.6.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-2.jpeg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos bring in young crop of forwards, defenders and goalkeepers for 2014 season.

Despite losing only five seniors from the roster to graduation, this recruiting class will try to fill the holes left in the forward and backline positions.</p>\n<p>Attempting to step up in the forward position will be Amanda Ball from Chino Hills High School, who headlines the class. Ball will have an opportunity to start right away and looks to fill the shoes of graduating senior forward Allie Ariniello, who tied for most goals on the team last year. Her athleticism and playmaking abilities up top make her a huge threat in the scoring department for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I think we finally bring in — in Amanda Ball — something we have not had for a while,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “And that’s a very athletic, a very smart and a very technical soccer player, who is going to score a number of goals herself. But, she’s also going to attract so much attention, that I think she’s going to open up some space for some other people.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Aside from Ball, the Gauchos turn to three more newcomers to add depth to the attacking positions. Brittney McKinney from Chaminade Prep in Woodland Hills, CA, is a player with a knack of putting the ball on frame and finished within the top 10 in her high school’s scoring list.</p>\n<p>Jordan Alves from Mary Star of the Sea High School can play in the forward and center midfielder position and can provide some versatility in the position. The San Pedro, CA native is in the discussion for possibly earning playing time in her first year. Recently committed Zoe Purcell from Torrey Pines High School, will add another option at the forward position for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We have not done a great job of scoring many goals the last couple of years,” Stumpf said. “We specifically went after some goal scorers that we thought were going to help us right away.”</p>\n<p>Defense, the strongest suit for UCSB last season, will lose three key leaders. The departure of Taylor Gehring and the Gankema twins, Paige and Lindsay, will most likely be filled by returning players, says Stumpf.</p>\n<p>However, Chace Schornstein from Redwood High School has potential to battle for a starting role, along with Kate Shoemaker from Poway High School in San Diego. The two use their size and physicality to keep the ball away from attackers.</p>\n<p>Despite a breakout season from junior Beth Ritter in between the goal posts last year, the Gauchos welcome three recruits in goalkeeping that can potentially threaten Ritter’s starting role. At 5’8”, Hannah Frogge from Bishop McGuinness High School in Oklahoma has the ideal frame for a goalkeeper and has athleticism to go with it. She had an impressive 90 percent save percentage her senior year.</p>\n<p>Remi White from Monte Vista High School and Brittney Rogers out of Murrieta Valley High School will also be in the goalkeeper rotation.</p>\n<p>“[Frogge is] going to come in and she’s going to challenge the two returning keepers pretty much right away in goal,” Stumpf said. “The other two goal keepers coming in — Remi White and Brittney Rogers — most likely, an educated guess will tell me they’re going to be backups at least their first years.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of May 8, 2014’s print edition of</em> The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of</em> The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55221\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/ucsb-brings-in-10-talented-freshmen-for-next-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55221\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/ucsb-brings-in-10-talented-freshmen-for-next-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/ucsb-brings-in-10-talented-freshmen-for-next-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/ucsb-brings-in-10-talented-freshmen-for-next-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/ucsb-brings-in-10-talented-freshmen-for-next-season/","id":1572,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1571,1570,1569],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Opens Regular Season Against Cleveland St.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The 2014 campaign for the UCSB women's soccer team begins tonight at home.

Our players must keep their minds nimble and we will play to our strengths.”</p>\n<p>On paper, the 2013 statistics for the Gauchos and Cleveland State are relatively even. Both teams shot a total of 26 goals on the season and averaged around one goal per game. However, there are a couple key differences that look to provide the Gauchos with an edge.</p>\n<p>While Cleveland State shot a higher shot percentage, .129 to .109, respectively, the Gauchos averaged nearly one more shot per game and took 22 more shots than Cleveland State last season. These additional opportunities could prove crucial to earning that coveted opening win.</p>\n<p>The biggest statistical difference however, lies in goals allowed average. In the 2013 season, Cleveland State had a GAA of 1.22 while the Gauchos posted a GAA of only 0.87. This large difference is testament to the Gaucho’s strong defense and the stellar play of junior goalkeeper Beth Ritter who tallied a total of eight shutouts last season.</p>\n<p>“This season, we are just hoping to be more consistent.” Ritter said. “We are all super fit and ready to go.”</p>\n<p>Joining Ritter in the starting lineup are fellow preseason honorees senior midfield/forward Indiana Mead and senior midfield/forward Madison Beckley. Mead and Beckley combined for seven goals, five assists and a total of 19 points.</p>\n<p>“We want to play hard and win,” Mead said. “We have had a complete shift from last season and this year, we have been vocal that our main goal is winning.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos must be weary of top opposing strikers junior Vickie Havas and senior Amanda Sivic. Havas led the team with seven goals and four assists, while Sivic was close behind with five goals and four assists.</p>\n<p>The match is set to kick off tonight at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55976\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-22/ucsb-opens-regular-season-against-cleveland-st/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55976\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-22/ucsb-opens-regular-season-against-cleveland-st/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-22/ucsb-opens-regular-season-against-cleveland-st/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-22/ucsb-opens-regular-season-against-cleveland-st/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-22/ucsb-opens-regular-season-against-cleveland-st/","id":1573,"author":{"id":66,"name":"Martin Cobos"},"related":[1572,1571,1570],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
