It was the Gauchos who came out looking like the top ranked team however, as freshman midfielder Christine Maurer headed home a perfectly placed cross by Mallory Hromatko in the seventh minute to give them the 1-0 lead. That lead was almost doubled a few minutes later when sophomore Colby Parker sent in a corner kick that clanked off a few players and into the net, yet the goal was called back because of a foul on the goalie.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rest of the first half was marked by a flurry of shots by the Gauchos which couldn’t quite find home, yet continued to put enough pressure on the Aggies so that they couldn’t get into any sort of offensive rhythm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis came out stronger in the second half, a pattern which they have followed all year, yet UCSB maintained the same physicality and energy that they came out of the gates with. Even though the Aggies tripled the amount of shots they took compared to the first half and had five more corner kicks than the Gauchos, UCSB still finished with more shots and more quality shots at that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having taken care of business Thursday night, the Gauchos moved on to what they hoped was the next step to a Big West tournament and faced off against Cal State Fullerton. Although the Titans were ranked below UCSB and Davis in the Big West standings, they actually had the best record overall in the conference and were certainly the Gauchos biggest test up to that point.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Titans struck first when redshirt senior Connie Caliz knocked in a well-placed corner kick by forward Atlanta Primus. The rest of the first half played out in their favor as Maddie Julian had to make a few great saves for the Gauchos just to keep the margin to one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB was never able to close that gap however as the offense stalled even more as the game went on. Opportunities by Sydney Magnin and Madeline Gibson offered moments of hope but it seemed like too much energy went to the stellar defense they played which left them drained on the attack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking ahead to next Sunday the Gauchos will be playing their season finale at Harder Stadium. Although the loss to Fullerton knocked UCSB down to eighth place in the Big West, their upcoming matchup against Cal Poly will be both an opportunity to beat their rivals and climb up to as far as fifth in the conference standings. Regardless of whether they can achieve a playoff berth or not the Gauchos will surely come out strong in the last game of the season.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

Despite receiving three yellow cards against LBSU, it still resulted in a stifling defensive effort on Santa Barbara’s end.</p>\n<p>UCSB hopes to continue to translate their aggressiveness to victories in their games this week against UC Davis and Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>The upcoming game against second-ranked UC Davis will be a great opportunity to gauge just where the Gauchos are in terms of their ability to play with the top teams in the conference. The Aggies are an anomaly at the top of the Big West. They actually have the worst overall record (4-9-1) by a large margin but have remained unbeaten (3-0-1) in conference play so far.</p>\n<p>“Davis is a tough place to play and they have got some serious momentum going being undefeated in conference so hopefully Sunday’s win was the start of something that could get us going,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>The key for UCSB is going to be taking advantage of a Davis defense that has been good at times but overall very porous this year. The Aggies have given up 1.14 goals a game while scoring .71, and they have conceded nearly twice as many shots as they have taken. These stats indicate a great chance for an offensive explosion by a UCSB squad that has only been held scoreless twice this year.</p>\n<p>Another focal point for the Gauchos is going to be coming out strong in the first half, something that they really haven’t had success doing this year. Two factors that play into that are the fact that a strong opening half is vital in taking away any home field advantage, as well as the fact that UC Davis, in particular, is a very strong second-half team.</p>\n<p>Seven of the 10 goals that the Aggies have scored this year have been in the second half, and they’ve let loose 50 percent more shots in the second half than in the first. If UCSB is able to set its tempo early on in the game and maintain pressure on the Aggies’ defense, they should be in a good position to win this game.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to Sunday’s matchup against Cal State Fullerton, the Gauchos will go through their toughest test yet. Although Fullerton is fifth in the Big West, it has the best overall record (9-3-3) in the conference. The Titans have been offensive juggernauts this year, averaging two goals a game and scoring three or more goals in five games this year.</p>\n<p>Leading the way for Fullerton this year is senior forward Sarah Fajnor, whose offensive output ranks among the top players in the league.</p>\n<p>She comes into this game second in the Big West in goals (6) and third in assists (4) and leads her team in both categories. A big part of the Gauchos’ defensive game plan will surely be to stifle her performance and try to force another player to beat them, but that is usually easier said than done.</p>\n<p>These last two road games will make or break UCSB’s season, as the Gauchos actually have a chance to make the Big West tournament if they play well and catch a few lucky breaks in terms of other teams’ performances.</p>\n<p>There should be no lack of effort on their part in these final few games of the season, and if the Gauchos steal a couple of victories, then a conference tournament appearance will certainly be in reach.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against UC Davis at 3 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 19, at the Aggie Soccer Field. The Gauchos’ season continues with its penultimate match of the year against Cal State Fullerton at 5 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 22 at Titan Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Oct. 19, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

CP started out the season 0-4 before winning five straight before again becoming owners of a four-game losing streak which leads them to its 6-7 overall record.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, Saturday’s game is not a must-win. However, it missed an opportunity to take a bigger lead in the conference standings with that loss to UC Davis, falling into a three-way tie for first place in the North with the Aggies and the Hornets, after they beat Cal Poly, meaning there is not much room for error with just two weeks left before tournament time.</p>\n<p>UCSB owns its Blue-Green rivalry with Cal Poly with an impressive 48-18-9 record against their fierce competitor. Normally, a record that lopsided would not give reason to support the notion this is the most impressive rivalry in college soccer, but the last few years would beg to differ.</p>\n<p>Over the last 10 years, the two squads have gone on to play some intense matches, with the record being 8-6-6 in favor of UCSB. Cal Poly is the only team to sweep the season series in the last 10 years as well, accomplishing the feat just once during the 2012-13 season. That also marks the last time CP has defeated UCSB in Harder in the past 19 years.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Santa Barbara has only won five of its ten home games over the past decade, with the last three games here at Harder Stadium ending in ties. UCSB, however, did take the victory at Cal Poly last year to win the season series.</p>\n<p>Not only has the great play helped increase the tenacity of the rivalry, but also the attendance, especially at Harder Stadium, has helped take this game to the next level.</p>\n<p>Last season’s attendance peaked at 11,424, the highest attended game in the NCAA in 2016 and in 2014, and the match reached 14, 919 fans in the Stadium, making it the second largest campus crowd in NCAA history, excluding playoffs.</p>\n<p>Getting to the game, the advantage seems to be with the home side despite the loss yesterday. Before that, the Gauchos were on fire, winning five of their last six games with their only non-win being a tie at UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>Before being scored on three times by Davis, freshman goalkeeper Adam Carrillo was on a roll, allowing just four goals in his previous six starts, and earning his second Big West Defensive Player of the Week honors last week for helping the Gauchos go 1-0-1.</p>\n<p>Even taking into account the three goals against the Aggies, Carrillo still holds the best goals-against average in the entire Big West at 1.05. His 40 saves rank fifth in the conference.<br>\nAnother freshman grabbing the headlines in Santa Barbara is Randy Michael. The forward has UCSB’s most consistent offensive player leading the team in goals (5), assists (4), and total points (14). His 14 points also rank fourth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Michael is also the only other Gaucho this season to win a Big West award. He won Offensive Player of the Week honors during the week of Sept. 28, after helping the Gauchos earn two victories against conference foes with two assists and two goals.</p>\n<p>Since conference play has started, Michael has earned nine of his total 14 points in these important matches with three goals and three assists.</p>\n<p>In the five Big West games UCSB has played, as a team, it ranks second in goals (10), assists (11) and points (31) while also shooting the second-highest percentage (.15).</p>\n<p>One of the keys for Cal Poly to earn a victory at Harder Stadium will be importance of starting the game off fast. This season CP has been outscored in the first half of games 11-8, but have bounced back to outscore opponents in the second half 6-5.</p>\n<p>Not only that, but its defense needs to limit the Gauchos opportunities, which is something it has not done much of, as they’ve been outshot 181-119 over the course of the season.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs will likely rely on goalkeeper Simon Boehme, whose 59 saves currently serves as the best mark in the Big West. The junior has allowed the fifth least goals in the conference, 15, and his .79 save percentage is a conference best.</p>\n<p>Boehme has also only allowed 15 goals on the season despite his team giving up the most shots. The 15 goals allowed is the fifth most in the Big West and his 1.24 goals allowed per game ranks fourth.</p>\n<p>Two players on Cal Poly’s side are tied for the team lead in goals (3). However, senior defender Adam Olsen will be sidelined during Saturday’s action due to earning a red card in Wednesday’s game.</p>\n<p>This means junior forward Sean Goode will have to try to carry the offensive flow against the Gauchos. Goode scored a goal against Sac State.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Diego Alonso will look to help his junior counterpart out as he leads the team in assists with four on the year, also tying him for the fourth best mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The rekindling of rivalries is always a special time in sports, especially at the collegiate level. No matter the sport, an intense rivalry game, a roarous crowd and a great stadium are always a great recipe for a wonderful evening. Especially for the students who will look to throw their tortillas Saturday Night.</p>\n<p>The Blue-Green rivalry will be renewed at 7 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 14 at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Oct. 12, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

irritated Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg had vowed that, no matter what, the team would come back stronger next season and that they would use that feeling of anguish and uselessness as extra motivation in the seven months to come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following their 7-0 dismantling of Westmont Aug. 18, it would be difficult to argue with Vom Steeg’s assertion. This year’s Gauchos, picked to finish second in the Big West behind only Cal State Fullerton, look poised to bounce back strong from last season’s disappointment due to several key new acquisitions as well as nine returning starters from last season’s team.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, Santa Barbara was shackled by its lack of finesse in the final third, scoring only 18 goals in 19 games. In an effort to bolster the attack, UCSB acquired junior transfer Thibault Candia, a pacey striker who led Temple last season with six goals. Candia already looked to be in mid-season form against Westmont, contributing two goals and chipping in two assists. He also displayed solid chemistry with junior Ignacio Tellechea, a returning starter who looks to better the four goals he scored last year for the squad. With the addition of freshman Carter Clemmensen, the Arizona Gatorade player of the year last season, UCSB should easily top its goal total from last season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the midfield, Santa Barbara returns two studs: sophomore Rodney Michael and junior captain Noah Billingsley. Billingsley struggled with injuries last season but was a key cog of the lineup when healthy. When he started, the Gauchos had a 5-1-4 record, but the team went just 1-6-1 when Billingsley was unable to play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael was one of the lone bright spots for UCSB last season, leading the team in both goals and assists en-route to a spot on the all-conference team as a freshman. With another year of training under his belt — as well as experience playing for the U-20 Sierra Leone national team — Michael will once again provide an offensive threat for Santa Barbara on the wing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While UCSB was sound on defense last season, the additions of sophomore Carson Vom Steeg and junior Faouzi Taieb should make the side’s back line even more dominate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vom Steeg, the son of Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg, played for Stanford last year, appearing in 18 games for a side that went on to win the national championship. While he was unable to play in the exhibition match due to injury, Vom Steeg will immediately improve the organization and shape of the Gauchos’ back line.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taieb, a transfer from St. Francis who was named the NEC defensive player of the year last season, showed his worth immediately in the exhibition match, leading a back line that didn’t allow a shot on goal in the entire 90 minutes. Taieb was also named to the MAC HERMANN award watch list — a list that highlights the top 75 players in the country heading into the season. If the two can get on the same page, the Gauchos should have arguably the most formidable back line in the conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB won’t have any grace period for their new players to get acclimated, as their first match of the season comes against St. John’s, a historically strong program that has already topped a top-25 team in the preseason. The other biggest tests in the off-season for Santa Barbara will come against Butler and UCLA, both in September. The Bulldogs were selected to finish second in the Big East conference, and before last season, the Bruins had made 34 consecutive NCAA tournaments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In conference play, the Gauchos will take on last season’s Big West champion, Cal State Fullerton, at home on Oct. 6, and they will finish off the regular season at home Oct. 27 against Cal Poly in the traditional Blue-green rivalry game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an abundance of talent and the hunger to leave last season’s blemish in the past, this UCSB squad has all of the tools necessary to challenge for the Big West title this season.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.
