The gift will come in the form of a combination of high tech study resources including a dedicated 3-D printer.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang highlighted the importance of libraries on campuses, saying the UCSB Library receives over 1.5 million visits a year.</p>\n<p>“As a hub of information, a library is a key component of inspiring original thought, creativity and communication,” Yang said. “As we celebrate the opening of this phenomenal building, let us also celebrate the bright future it represents for our campus.”</p>\n<p>Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall said that it was “important this ceremony is being held at the ‘Paseo.’”</p>\n<p>“This passage is not a corridor, it’s a vital artery in the heart of the campus,” Marshall said.</p>\n<p>Marshall finished on a more personal note, focusing on the library’s role in students’ lives and what it symbolizes to an academic community.</p>\n<p>“The library remains a place of learning and teaching, the crossroads of tradition and innovation, a laboratory of discovery and reinvention,” Marshall said. “Our new library offers a safe refuge space for quiet study and contemplation. It’s a place to lose oneself and to find oneself alongside others.”</p>\n<p>Following Marshall’s speech, representatives from State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson and Assemblymember Das Williams’ offices presented Yang and Stephens with a plaque commemorating the opening of the renovated library.</p>\n<p>Aaron Jones, Associated Students advisor and Graduate Student Association president, said current U.S. culture celebrates the addictions of money, power and prestige and instead invited all in attendance to celebrate the addiction to truth.</p>\n<p>“I have chosen this opportunity to invite you all to share a different type of addiction, something we can all be addicted to and not be ashamed of,” Jones said. “The addiction to truth, the addiction to the acquisition of knowledge, the addiction to finding our own individual answers to questions posed in the classroom and throughout our daily lives. That addiction, that quest, is what our newly renovated library inspires me to share with you.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67373\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67373\" data-attachment-id=\"67373\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/ceremony-held-for-opening-of-new-library/student-speaker/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"student speaker\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452701975\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00025\",\"title\":\"student speaker\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"student speaker\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-67373\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1-1024x678.jpg?resize=888%2C588\" alt=\"student speaker\" width=\"888\" height=\"588\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67373\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Following Jones’ speech, Yang cut a ceremonial ribbon and welcomed all in attendance to come explore the space while musical and dance groups performed throughout the library.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Katya Armistead said she wants to try out every chair in the building.</p>\n<p>“The chairs are amazing; I’ve sat on four different types so far, so it’s really fun to check out all of them,” Armistead said. “There’s some tall stools, there’s some that are kinda like arm chairs, and then, [check] out these chairs in the training room, they contour to your body very nicely.”<br>\nArmistead said she is already in love with the new library addition, although she is worried it may still be too small for the hordes of students who come to study.</p>\n<p>“I love how the entrance is so grand and inviting.

University of Washington, Seattle to give a lecture titled “Back There We Had Nothing to Eat: Food Insecurity and Women’s Migration at the Intersections.”</p>\n<p>The lecture, which took place Tuesday afternoon at the McCune Conference Center, focused on the conditions displacing many women and families across borders, how hunger and food insecurity relates to the inequality of opportunities across borders and how gender shapes experiences with food insecurity and health vulnerability for migrants in the United States. Carney’s research focuses specifically on the effects of food insecurity on women who migrate to the United States from Mexico and Central America.</p>\n<p>According to Carney, these women experience unique consequences of displacement.</p>\n<p>“Women from these communities have faced a unique set of challenges,” Carney said. “Women’s decision to migrate may exhibit a desire to uphold social obligations in the realm of food.”</p>\n<p>Carney said the globalization of trade and neoliberal policies have caused food insecurity and subsequently displaced many agrarian communities from Mexico and Central America.</p>\n<p>“The North American Free Trade Agreement serves as a prime example of legislation that have displaced many rural Mexican farmers because of their occupation, because they are unable to compete with subsidized produce,” Carney said.</p>\n<p>Carney also said food insecurity is a result of structural readjustments to food and trade that come with neoliberal policy.</p>\n<p>“Food insecurity is a palpable consequence of policy shifts and represents the depriving politics of the state,” Carney said. “States often do the depriving intentionally or unintentionally.”</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Jade Burchett said the lecture explained undocumented migrants’ challenges and motivations and showed that migration is a complex issue.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67343\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67343\" data-attachment-id=\"67343\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-13/professor-megan-carney-lectures-on-migration-food-insecurity/megan-carney_-by-lorenzo-basilio-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452615024\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Megan Carney_ by Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67343\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x684.jpg?resize=800%2C534\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Megan-Carney_-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67343\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I liked that the lecture showed the perspective of a group of people who are so stigmatized,” Burchett said. “Often, people belittle migrants by calling them ‘illegal’ and question their motives for crossing the border. This talk showed their motives and how it’s almost necessary for them to migrate.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Chican@ studies major Jorge Gonzalez said the lecture highlighted the struggle many migrant families face trying to provide nutritious meals during economic hardship.</p>\n<p>“Due to their unauthorized status, they don’t have access to many jobs and often end up working jobs that only give them 20 minutes to an hour to prepare meals,” Gonzalez said. “Because they don’t have time to prepare meals, these families often use prepared food, which has health consequences.”</p>\n<p>Carney said the food financially available to most migrant families is very unhealthy.</p>\n<p>“Many of my key informants perceived the abundance of ‘comida chattara,’ or junk food, in the United States as jeopardizing the efforts of migrants to maintain healthy diets for their family members,” Carney said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Food Bank and CalFresh Representative Amy Lopez said the Food Bank offers services to the families in Santa Barbara County that face food insecurity.</p>\n<p>“The Food Bank of Santa Barbara County is a nonprofit organization that distributes food to people in need and empowers people with nutrition education,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>To learn more about food insecurity and resources for families in Santa Barbara County, visit Santa Barbara Food Bank’s website at <em><a

preparedness and medical operations throughout January and February.</p>\n<p>The training program will consist of three classes and will train participants to handle real-life disasters, including terrorism and homeland defense. For the course, CERT will work alongside the UCSB American Red Cross Club and Associated Students, which will provide backpacks, flashlights and hardhats for emergency situations. The trainings will be held on Jan. 24 and 31 and Feb. 6 from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in the UCSB Environmental and Health Safety Building 565.</p>\n<p>UCSB Emergency Manager Jim Caesar, who is on the State Advisory Board for CERT and organizes CERT trainings, said these classes are important to helping others during a widespread emergency.</p>\n<p>“If we can learn to take care of ourselves, our friends, our neighbors, our family and loved ones, the better off we will be,” Caesar said. “These are important skill sets for our everyday life.”</p>\n<p>Caesar said he is proud of the UCSB program because he believes it is the only university in the nation that offers a training course where students can become certified to teach the course.</p>\n<p>“The CERT class at UCSB is actually taught by students to students,” Caesar said. “[To become a trainer], there is another 20-hour class that they take in order to become certified.”</p>\n<p>President of UCSB American Red Cross and fourth-year biology major Heather Halaweh said she took the CERT course her first year at UCSB after becoming certified for lifeguarding and benefitted from the course’s triage training.</p>\n<div

prioritize patients and how to take care of them within a certain time-frame,” Halaweh said.</p>\n<p>Halaweh said after taking the CERT class, she feels more comfortable about potentially handling an emergency because she now knows what to expect.</p>\n<p>“It is really empowering to know that you can help,” Halaweh said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biopsychology major and CERT instructor Amanda McKenna said she became a certified CERT instructor because she is passionate about medical operations and believes the program prepares students for unexpected disasters.</p>\n<p>“I liked the fact that [the course] gets the community together and prepares people for emergency disaster situations that they wouldn’t normally be prepared for,” McKenna said.</p>\n<p>McKenna said she will be proud to see students complete a full emergency simulation at the end of the course to demonstrate what they have learned.</p>\n<p>“We have our students use all the skills that they learned, anywhere from carrying people out of structures to triaging,” McKenna said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year history and political science double major Duncan Calvert attended the basic CERT course last year and plans to become an instructor.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a really important course for building strong community values and making sure your environment and community is safe,” Calvert said.</p>\n<p>Calvert said he believes the course gives students the opportunity to learn about the emergency response process and prepare them to assist in disasters.</p>\n<p>“It’s important in helping individuals understand how emergency services work and how they can help out or stay out of harm’s way in the event of a disaster,” Calvert said. “CERT is much more about understanding how emergencies work, and how individuals within the community can help other community members and emergency services do their job.”</p>\n<p>To sign up for the course, students can email Jim Caesar at <em><a

candlelight vigil on Thursday, hosted at the Associated Students Pardall Center by students in association with Black Student Union.</p>\n<p>Madison was a lecturer in the Black Studies Department for over 30 years, and passed away on December 29. During his time at UCSB he taught several courses regarding Blacks in sports and media and the Civil Rights Movement, and had a penchant for ruffling feathers with his unapologetic teaching style. Roque-Ramirez was an associate professor of Chican@ studies at UCSB until last year, teaching courses about LGBTQ and Chican@ narratives before passing away on December 25. Roque-Ramirez was born in Santa Ana, Salvador and in 1981 immigrated to the United States to escape the Salvadorian Civil War. He co-founded the Latin American Students Association at UCLA as an undergraduate and is remembered for his passion and resilience in academia.</p>\n<p>Faviana Hirsch-Dubin, former UCSB professor in the Chican@ Studies and education departments, knew both Madison and Roque-Ramirez during her time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“From the very first that I met Professor Roque-Ramirez, we had a magic connection … which I think a lot of people felt with him because he emanated that,” Hirsch-Dubin said. “[Madison] was the voice of reason when it came to race. His understandings were profound and he shared them and inspired many students over so many years.”</p>\n<p>Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval, professor of Chican@ Studies, said both Madison and Roque-Ramirez were extremely influential during their time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Horacio was a brilliant man, not only in the regard of being a scholar,” Armbruster-Sandoval said. “He used to say … ‘I’m a triple threat. I’m gay, I’m Salvadorian and I’m a historian and I’m really gonna … blow boundaries away,’ and that’s what he did. He was able to resonate with many people because he survived so much himself.”</p>\n<p>Armbruster-Sandoval said Madison played an irreplaceable role in students’ lives, one that was made apparent by how much students cared for him as a professor.</p>\n<p>“They loved him in terms of what he passed on, he spoke truth to power — unflinchingly,” Armbruster-Sandoval said. “He was just about standing up for life. Otis stood up for justice, for people that were hurting.”</p>\n<p>Sonya Baker, Feminist Studies Business Officer, said Madison and Roque-Ramirez were two “wonderful strong warriors” who influenced UCSB.</p>\n<p>“There was a teach-in about four years ago … and Otis was in that particular presentation. When he started talking, it was such a relief to hear someone talking without filters or without fear about the problems we face as people of color in this country,” Baker said. “It was fearsome and it was beautiful, and I loved it.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67247\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67247\" data-attachment-id=\"67247\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/professor-vigil_by-lorenzo-basilio-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452187438\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"105\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Professor Vigil\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67247\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=750%2C501\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"750\" height=\"501\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professor-Vigil_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67247\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Lola Mondragón, sixth-year graduate student in the Chican@ Studies department, said Roque-Ramirez as an educator and peer had an unspoken understanding of students’ needs.</p>\n<p>“I had gotten out of the military and was a survivor of trauma … we didn’t have a lot of words that we needed to share. He understood that,” Mondragón said. “He validated my experiences that I was having as a graduate student in the academy, a place that is very violent, especially against people of color and queer people like myself. We stand on the shoulders of great people and he will be one of those that I lean on.”</p>\n<p>Jamelia Harris, fourth-year Black Studies and sociology double major and co-chair of BSU, took <em>BL ST 50:</em> <em>Blacks in the Media</em> her second year and said students who weren’t in Madison’s class would often attend his lectures.</p>\n<p>“He definitely was intimidating to me initially. I can remember my first time entering his classroom and the first words he said to me were, ‘Do you think Barack Obama gives a fuck about you?’ and that was an interlude to his personality,” Harris said. “He was so unapologetic and so comfortable in who he was. He didn’t aim to please anyone … he made sure that black students’ voices were centered in his classroom.”</p>\n<p>Rosie Bermudez, fourth-year Chican@ Studies major, said she applied to the Chican@ Studies major because of Roque-Ramirez and his work recovering the stories of marginalized peoples’ lives.</p>\n<p>“I feel blessed that I was able to talk to him … enjoy his humor, his smile, and even though I only had a brief amount of time to know him, I feel he has truly impacted my life. It is really painful to know that their stories were not shared with more people,” Bermudez said.</p>\n<p>Oral historian at the UC Santa Cruz library Irene Reti first met Roque-Ramirez in Buffalo, New York at an oral history conference in 1998. Reti said Roque-Ramirez quickly became a visionary leader in the Oral History Association, doing “cutting-edge” work on queer oral history.</p>\n<p>“Horacio Roque Ramirez and I were among the first out queer oral historians in the Oral History Association. I had the pleasure of serving with him on the Oral History Executive Council,” Reti said in an email. “He did … inspirational work … especially co-editing <em>Bodies of Evidence: The Practice of Queer Oral History</em> with Nan Boyd. I will miss Horacio and am very sad at his passing.”</p>\n<p>Joanne Yansen Madison, wife of Otis Madison, briefly attended the vigil and was joined by her sister, Madison’s daughter and two sons in thanking attendees for their stories.</p>\n<p>“You know how [Otis] was … he would say, ‘Sure I’m great, I’m the greatest teacher they got!’ but it would always touch him when students would come back and say ‘I took your class and it changed my life,’” Joanne Madison said. “Thank you for standing out here tonight and for honoring your teachers, for learning more about your world and your society and for changing things.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67258\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67258\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-08/vigil-held-to-honor-professors-otis-madison-and-horacio-roque-ramirez/","id":2573,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2572,2571,2570],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
