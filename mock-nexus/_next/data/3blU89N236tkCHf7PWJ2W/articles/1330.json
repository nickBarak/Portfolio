This year, the Terrapins have made easy work of their opponents through the NCAA Tournament thus far, achieving shutouts in all matches.</p>\n<p>Despite the story told by the numbers, No. 11 Maryland has knocked off nationally-ranked programs along the way. Most notably perhaps, is the Terps’ 1-0 victory over No. 3 Kentucky last Friday, Nov. 30. Not only shutting out the third-ranked team in the nation, but also doing so on the Wildcat’s home turf in Lexington demonstrates the momentum Maryland is riding heading into this year’s Final Four.</p>\n<p>Given Maryland’s success in the postseason this year, it may be assumed the team has been prospering since the season’s start in August. Contrarily, the Terps didn’t pick up their first win until they hosted West Virginia at home on Sep. 10, roughly two-and-a-half weeks into the season. Prior to its 1-0 shutout win over the Mountaineers, Maryland held a 0-2-2 record. Obviously an undesirable start for any team, the Terps still find themselves at the College Cup, thriving nonetheless.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After the team’s shaky start, Maryland has managed to culminate an 11-6-4 overall record; however, the narrative of the Terps’ season encompasses an element of growth. An overtime loss at home to Big Ten foe Wisconsin in September found the Terps deflated, sitting sub-.500 once again.</p>\n<p>The loss came only a week after Maryland earned its second consecutive win of the year to get to .500. Whether or not the Terrapins knew in September that they’d return to racking up consecutive wins when it mattered or not, the team bounced back from the Wisconsin loss, going 9-3-2 to reach the biggest stage of college soccer.</p>\n<p>Through their rejuvenation following the loss to the Badgers, the Terrapins mustered a 4-4 record in the competitive Big Ten conference. At the top of the Big Ten, this season is Indiana, boasting a perfect 8-0-0 conference record as part of its 20-2-1 overall record.</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, the Hoosiers are who stand in Maryland’s way now as the two conference opponents are set to face off for the third time this season. This time, though, the stakes are much higher.</p>\n<p>Back in October, Indiana defeated the Terps 2-1, but November saw Maryland settle for a 1-1 tie against the Hoosiers in the second round of the Big Ten Tournament. It is since that 1-1 tie that the Terps have achieved three consecutive NCAA Tournament shutouts.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned victory over Kentucky stands as the most recent of upsets for Maryland, but a week prior to the taming of the Wildcats found the Terps defeating No. 10 Duke at home 2-0. The Blue Devils had no answer for Maryland, as they were met with the same fate that Kentucky arrived at a week later.</p>\n<p>The Terps may have an inclination to spoil opposing fans’ hopes on the road, but Harder Stadium in Santa Barbara will perhaps offer an even greater outcome to be coveted.</p>\n<p>Along with two winless games worth of potential revenge, the Terps have the opportunity to knock off the kingpin of the Big Ten and the second-ranked team in the country on Friday night. The Hoosiers will undoubtedly aim to prove why they’re deserving of their unblemished 8-0-0 conference record; however, Maryland is a different, more nuanced team heading into the match.</p>\n<p>Led primarily by senior midfielder Amar Sejdic, Maryland boasts a balanced attacking core featuring junior forward/midfielder Paul Bin alongside Sejdic. Sejdic in his senior year has started all 19 games for the Terps and leads the team with six goals off of 54 shots.</p>\n<p>Despite the hefty amount of misses implied in the midfielder’s shooting statistics, it’s clear Sejdic is comfortable taking the lead and will undoubtedly be looked for on the offensive side of things Friday night.</p>\n<p>While clearly a prominent part of Maryland’s offensive gameplan, Sejdic remains without a goal in this year’s two games against Indiana. Likely drawing ample and deserved attention from the Hoosiers on Friday, Sejdic will perhaps open up chances for teammates like Bin to exploit.</p>\n<p>In October’s loss to Indiana, Bin scored the lone goal for Maryland, so he will look to find the back of the net again. With four goals and two assists, Bin sits behind Sejdic in scoring but ranks second on the team in efficiency. In contrast to Sejdic’s 54 shots, Bin has tallied only 26.</p>\n<p>While Sejdic and Bin have been responsible for 12 of Maryland’s goals this season, the Terps’ roster holds three other players who have scored at least two goals on the year. This balanced scoring potential, as well as experience, might be expected at this stage of the postseason, but it provides Maryland the luxury to trust their offensive sets and find the net organically rather than play hero ball.</p>\n<p>Heading into Friday’s game against Indiana, Maryland has the opportunity to knock out a Hoosier team responsible for two winless matches, but the Terps are playing for much more than revenge. Despite the tantalizing element of revenge, Maryland looks for a more rewarding outcome of playing for the College Cup Championship.</p>\n<p>With revenge as well as championship aspirations on the line, the Terrapins will face Indiana at 7:30 p.m. on Dec. 7 at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

The Gauchos are 3-2 after having taken down Gonzaga and Oregon State in their last two games, while the Redhawks own a very symmetrical 2-2-2 record to kick off the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB is coming into this matchup looking to continue to build positive momentum with a tough final slate of non-conference games looming at the end of the month.</p>\n<p>The biggest question for the Gauchos so far has been the presence, or lack thereof, of their defensive players.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Early injuries to senior defender Faouzi Taieb and freshman Lucas Gonzalez, along with Hunter Ashworth and Noah Billingsley being called up to play for the New Zealand U-23 squad, left the team with a depleted backline to start off the year.</p>\n<p>While there is no official return date for Taieb or Gonzalez (who seemed to have the more serious injury of the two), both Billingsley and Ashworth returned last weekend and have already made a world of difference.</p>\n<p>UCSB conceded six goals in two losses prior to their return; since they have been back, they have scored four goals while conceding only one with two wins.</p>\n<p>The Kiwis’ sturdy defensive presence allows players in the middle like Sahid Conteh and Thibault Candia to have more of an attacking mindset instead of having to worry about supporting in the back third. Their ability to push the ball up has helped create space for the wingers and forwards as well.</p>\n<p>Seattle University has had a textbook roller coaster start to the season.</p>\n<p>The Redhawks have notched impressive wins against USF, who they handily defeated 5-0, and the University of Portland.</p>\n<p>Their .500 record is slightly deceiving however, as both losses were to quality teams (No. 16 Notre Dame and No. 12 University of Washington) and they tied one of the best teams in the country in No. 4 Indiana University.</p>\n<p>The team is led by redshirt junior forward Noe Meza, who has been a scoring phenom to start this season off. The Washington native leads both the team and the Western Athletic Conference in goals (four), and is also fourth in the conference in shots.</p>\n<p>Meza led the team in scoring last season as well (eight) and is not new to the Seattle U/UCSB rivalry. He scored the pivotal goal in their 2-0 win over the Gauchos last year and will certainly be on the hunt for another against this season against the depleted SB backline.</p>\n<p>One of the key facets of this game might actually not even have anything to do with the players themselves, but rather where the game is being played.</p>\n<p>The Redhawks still haven’t picked up a win on the road this year, losing their only away game and tying their only game on neutral ground. UCSB is trying to get Harder Stadium back to the fortress it was last season, when they posted an undefeated 9-0-1 record, but early injuries hindered them in their two latest home matchups against UC Berkeley and No.17 Virginia Tech.</p>\n<p>The crowd might not be as large as this move-in weekend when the team takes on University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), but if enough students are back to kick off the quarter then it could be one of the deciding factors.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have their work cut out for them on the defensive end but their offense will determine how well they can compete against a high-powered Seattle squad.</p>\n<p>Goalscoring has been by committee so far this year, with six different players scoring so far and no player scoring more than once.</p>\n<p>One notable absence from the stat sheets this season has been star forward Rodney Micheal, who led the team in scoring last season but has yet to notch a goal so far this year.</p>\n<p>Whether defense has been honing in on him more or it’s just a personal slump, Micheal has not been the attacking force that the team is going to need to have a successful year.</p>\n<p>Watch for him to try to take advantage of a Redhawk defense that just gave up three goals in their last game.</p>\n<p>This game might not count towards UCSB’s conference record, which will ultimately determine the team’s chance at making it to the NCAA Tournament, but the Gauchos need to get some positive momentum as Big West play approaches. With a matchup against powerhouse No. 2 Stanford drawing nearer, this game will be a good test to see how close this squad is to being able to compete against the top teams in the country.</p>\n<p>UCSB versus Seattle U kicks off at 7 p.m Thursday night at Harder Stadium here on campus.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Sept. 19</em><em>, 2019, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

The Cardinal had only trailed for 30 minutes out of the previous 630 that they had played, and they had given up a total of two goals prior to this matchup.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos would double that total just five minutes later, when forward Baynham headed home an Ignacio Tellechea free kick in the 19th minute to put UCSB up 2-0. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the half wore on, both teams began to get into their offensive rhythms. Stanford in particular started to pass the ball around and open up the Gaucho defense, but if the backline just continued to hold their own and limit any mistakes UCSB had a great chance to take its lead into the halftime break.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately the Gauchos made a crucial mental mistake with just three minutes to go into the half, sending up numbers trying to score a third goal which left them vulnerable to a counter-attack. Stanford forward Ousseni Bouda took the ball down the length of the pitch and sent in a cross from the right wing which dropped right around the penalty spot. Because UCSB had sent so many players up the field, there were no defenders around to clear the ball, and junior forward Arda Bulut had a wide open shot on goal which he put in the back of the net.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although UCSB was essentially playing with house money at this point, it still was disappointing for the team to give up a goal when they just had to hold strong for a few more minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we had gone into the half up 2-0 it would have obviously been better in terms of trying to win the game,” Coach Vom Steeg pointed out postgame. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stanford came out strong to start off the second half, searching for an equalizer. The Cardinal would get it just two and a half minutes into the period, when defender Keegan Hughes charged through the Gaucho defense unmarked to head home a Logan Panchot corner kick.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a reason that a 2-0 lead is known as the worst lead to have in a soccer game, because as the Gauchos learned the hard way, once the opposing team scores one goal, another one usually follows closely behind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This shift in momentum could have proved fatal for UCSB if it was a lesser team, but the squad’s star power is what kept them in the game. And in the 62nd minute it was the star junior Rodney Michael who came through for the Gauchos as he has so many times before. After a Baynham shot that was blocked by the Stanford goalie, Michael received the ball at the top of the box, did a quick dribble move to get the ball to his right foot and rocketed the ball into the back of the net giving UCSB the 3-2 lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was at this point that the energy of the packed crowd at Harder Stadium reached its peak, and there seemed to be a great chance for the Gauchos to finish the job and give Stanford its first loss of the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB was able to hold strong all the way until the 85th minute, when redshirt sophomore Zach Ryan received a cross in the box and passed it over to fellow Cardinal Charlie Wehan who knocked the ball in for his second goal of the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a tough end to regulation for the Gauchos who had fought so hard to maintain their lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was really frustrating because obviously the whole team had battled so hard to get to that point where we were in the lead,” Michael said after the game. “It was just those last five minutes that we weren’t able to pull through.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The game then went into overtime, where both teams had chances to score that they couldn’t put away. The most impactful event of the whole game actually came at the end of the first overtime, however, when UCSB senior defender Faouzi Taieb broke his leg after a collision in the box. Taieb was the team’s rock on defense, and losing him with an already depleted defensive backline will be tough for the Gauchos to recover from moving forward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All in all it was a great effort from our guys. It is a positive result in terms of where we were,” Coach Vom Steeg said after the game. “But [the team is] really disappointed about what happened to our star defender.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

The Spartans have only one loss on the road this season, which came in Fort Wayne, Indiana as the Hoosiers knocked off the green and white in a 1-0 overtime thriller.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>MSU has thrived since its last game against a Big Ten foe as the Spartans are winners of four straight matches heading into the Final Four this weekend. Following a first-round win against the University of Chicago, Illinois with a 2-0 victory, Michigan State found itself matched up against No. 4 Louisville in the second round.</p>\n<p>The Spartans got out to an early lead in the 16th minute as freshman midfielder Jack Beck received a lead from senior forward Ryan Sierakowski on a breakaway hook to the bottom right-hand corner. Louisville was able to tie it up one goal apiece with a strike in the 77th minute that ultimately forced the game into overtime.</p>\n<p>Just two minutes into extra time, junior midfielder Giuseppe Barone sent a free kick from the left side into the six. Louisville bobbled a crucial clearance as senior defenseman John Freitag netted a walk-off finish that propelled Michigan State to its second Sweet 16 appearance in as many seasons.</p>\n<p>In game three of the playoffs, sophomore midfielder Michael Miller lasered a first-half strike from 35 yards out, which was all the Spartans needed to edge out the win against No. 13 Georgetown with a slim 1-0 shutout. Georgetown peppered off five shots in the final five-minute frame, but their comeback attack fell short as the Spartans advanced to their second consecutive Elite 8 appearance.</p>\n<p>James Madison University struck early in its Quarter-Finals matchup with Michigan State as Dukes’ junior defensive midfielder Niclas Mohr snuck a dribbler past senior keeper Jimmy Hague for one of only two goals that Hague has allowed during the postseason tournament.</p>\n<p>As the Spartans’ season was dwindling at point-blank range, Sierakowski took matters into his own hands as he lifted the ball just over a diving Dukes keeper to tie the game up at 1-1 with less than 20 minutes to play.</p>\n<p>Under 10 minutes later, Sierakowski was back for vengeance again as the Spartans made a game-winning drive down the pitch. Senior defender Connor Corrigan lofted a long, arcing pass up to redshirt sophomore defender Patrick Nielsen who corralled the feed and found Sierakowski in the box for a split-second look.</p>\n<p>Sierakowski made a snap decision as he read the keeper’s range from three yards out. With a hesitation move and a swift heel touch, the veteran striker finessed a curl around Dukes goalkeeper TJ Bush that capped off the 2-1 comeback and sent the Spartans to their first Final Four appearance in 50 years.</p>\n<p>In his senior year, Sierakowski has been premier on the attack for the Spartans as the McHenry, Illi. native has delivered eight goals and five assists in 22 games this season while leading the Spartans past a mighty Big Ten Conference that boasted four teams that were selected to participate in the 2018 NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>The Big Ten commands the Final Four this season as Michigan State, University of Maryland and University of Indiana make up three of the remaining four teams still in the running to take home the College Cup.</p>\n<p>Ryan Sierakowski finished the season as the No. 4 goal scorer in the Big Ten Conference and in the No. 5 spot for overall points as well with a team-leading 21 points on the season. On top of that, his four game winners on the season were tied for second in the Big Ten.</p>\n<p>The dangerous forward is complimented well by a playmaking Barone who ranks second in the conference in assists with 10 on the year. Barone is an elusive 5’9’’ attacking mid that powers the Spartan charge with 16 points tallied this year, which was good for second on the team.</p>\n<p>As if the Sierakowski-Barone one-two punch wasn’t enough, senior forward and Michigan native DeJuan Jones has posted five goals along with five assists in 2018 to round out a deadly triangle rotation for MSU.</p>\n<p>The trio of experience led Michigan State to the No. 2 in the Big Ten Conference in both total points with 112 and goals on the year with 35 goals in 22 games.</p>\n<p>Holding it down on the defensive end for Sparta, Hague owns the No. 1 goalkeeping mark in the Big Ten with 79 saves this year, putting him on a track for nine shutout performances in the 22 games he started for the Spartans. His nine blanks this season are tied for No. 9 in the nation among Division I goalies.</p>\n<p>Hague’s .840 save percentage is the best in the conference and No. 10 in the NCAA, while his .66 goals allowed per match is No. 2 in the Big Ten.</p>\n<p>With a stout Spartans backline that only allows .77 goals per contest, the best way to slow down Michigan State is to limit its sharp attack.</p>\n<p>Yet with Ryan Sierakowski spearheading the attack and a fearsome duo in Barone and Jones at Sierakowski’s immediate disposal, this Spartan squad looks to ride its unforeseen tournament run to its first title in 50 years.</p>\n<p>The Michigan State Spartans will take on University of Akron in the first game of the Final Four on Dec. 7 at 5 p.m. at Harder Stadium in Santa Barbara, Calif.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85318\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/spartans-sharpen-spears-for-first-final-four-appearance-in-50-years/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85318\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/spartans-sharpen-spears-for-first-final-four-appearance-in-50-years/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/spartans-sharpen-spears-for-first-final-four-appearance-in-50-years/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/spartans-sharpen-spears-for-first-final-four-appearance-in-50-years/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/spartans-sharpen-spears-for-first-final-four-appearance-in-50-years/","id":1328,"author":{"id":36,"name":"Max Kelton"},"related":[1327,1326,1325],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
