It calls on the UC to end the use of all Proposition 65 herbicide on the campus, and asks the university to “notify students, faculty, and staff before any synthetic herbicides are sprayed at UCSB and in surrounding areas, including location and time details.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the resolution many of the synthetic herbicides used by the UC </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">such as glyphosate, oryzalin and 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are considered by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer to be probable carcinogens, meaning long-term exposure to such chemicals could be detrimental to human health.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the resolution states there have been a considerable number of court cases in California ruled that glyphosate-based herbicides had caused cancer, referencing one where, in August 2018, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">San Francisco Superior Court jury in the Dewayne Johnson v. Monsanto case found that glyphosate-based herbicide exposure was responsible for the plaintiff’s terminal cancer. Johnson was awarded $79 million. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The San Francisco Federal Court also ruled exposure to these same synthetic chemicals were the probable cause of cancer in another plaintiff, Hardeman, awarding him $80 million, according to the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This short-sighted outlook, on minimizing acute toxicity for maximum weed control, leaves our groundskeepers, communities and environments vulnerable to the long term impacts,” Sheina Crystal, student sponsor of the resolution, said in an interview.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The UC system should prioritize the health and safety of land managers, students, faculty and community members over campus aesthetics and band aid treatments.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A similar resolution was previously brought to the table at last year’s 69th Senate and also passed, but ultimately expired after the 70th senate took office.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Regents did temporarily suspend the use of glyphosate on all UC campuses, which came into effect in June 2019, with several exceptions, citing “concerns about possible human health and ecological hazards, as well as potential legal and reputational risks associated with this category of herbicides,” according to the </span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/july19/c4.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office of the President</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Various universities across the nation have already taken steps toward reducing and eliminating harmful herbicides on their campuses.

The Cavs star also helped introduce Clinton during a rally held in Cleveland where he endorsed her a second time.</p>\n<p>Now the 45th president-elect of the United States, Trump mentioned the support he had received from Tom Brady and Bill Belichick during a rally in New Hampshire a day before the election.</p>\n<p>Brady had previously made a statement in favor of a Trump presidency and a Make America Great Again hat was seen in his locker over a year ago.</p>\n<p>Although the two athletes supported candidates who were on opposing sides, the fact that both were willing to take the steps necessary to use their influence during this year’s election is an important liberty that other athletes should be encouraged to take.</p>\n<p>Athletes have historically received criticism for taking stances on political issues. During the 1968 Summer Olympics, U.S. runners John Carlos and Tommie Smith famously did the Black Power salute in the medal ceremony, raising their black-gloved fists in the air while the national anthem played.</p>\n<p>The athletes were subsequently banned from the games, and upon returning home they found themselves, and their families, receiving death threats.</p>\n<p>The two Olympic runners never wavered from their protest, and just this year the pair supported another protest from a fellow athlete, Colin Kaepernick.</p>\n<p>The San Francisco 49ers quarterback has been kneeling during the playing of the national anthem in football games since the start of the 2016 season in protest of recent wrongdoings done to the black community in America.</p>\n<p>Fellow football players have joined Kaepernick in his protest during the national anthem, and the reason for his protest has inspired other demonstrations in other professional leagues.</p>\n<p>On July 9 and 10, several teams in the WNBA wore black shirts in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. They bore the names of victims Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. The teams also wore shirts in memory of the five victims of the Dallas shooting.</p>\n<p>The WNBA fined the three teams (the New York Liberty, the Indiana Fever and the Phoenix Mercury) $5,000 each, and each player was fined $500 for violating the league’s uniform policy.</p>\n<p>The WNBA later rescinded the fines and vouched support for the players’ protest, but the initial punishment is exactly the type of action that prevents and intimidates players from attempting to use their platform to make their political statements.</p>\n<p>No matter what the political views or stances are that athletes desire to use their platforms to advocate for, the leagues must commit to providing an environment for athletes to utilize their First Amendment rights and demonstrate if they choose to do so without fear of reprisal.</p>\n<p>Players like the ones in the WNBA, Colin Kaepernick and LeBron James are no different from the likes of celebrated athletic and cultural icons like Jackie Robinson, Muhammad Ali, Tommie Smith and John Carlos.</p>\n<p>These players from the past and present have used their platform and influence to evoke change, not because of a need to boost their own profile, but to serve the basic human desire to speak out against something that is unjust and unfair.</p>\n<p>These players deserve to be seen as people, not just athletes, who patriotically utilize their First Amendment rights to take a stand despite criticism from the public or even their own league.</p>\n<p>All athletes from across the country, whether at the professional, collegiate or high school level, deserve an environment conducive to exercise their constitutional rights.</p>\n<p>“In any protest, I think you make a statement to try and reach the far ends of the Earth. What better way to do it than if you’re in a sport,” Carlos said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 17, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily

photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The designation, which is valid for the next four years, recognizes UCSB’s efforts in creating an environment that fosters safe and accessible bike riding while encouraging students to switch to bicycles for transportation, according to the League of American Bicyclists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Bicycle Friendly University program evaluates applicants’ efforts to promote bicycling in five primary areas: engineering, encouragement, education, enforcement and evaluation/planning, known as the Five E’s,” the </span><a href=\"https://bikeleague.org/university\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">League’s website states</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the first year that UCSB has been designated as such, and it joins the other seven institutions — including UC Davis and UC Irvine  — that have been awarded the same designation of Platinum-level Bike Friendly Universities (BFUs). In 2011 and 2015, UCSB received the less prestigious Gold-level distinction, according to the League. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amelia Neptune, a representative from the League of American Bicyclists, said in an email to the Nexus that there were “a few weaknesses” from UCSB’s 2015 application, which is why the university was not awarded a Platinum distinction before. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[There was] </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the lack of bike share at the time (there was a program but it had five bikes total, as opposed to the 650-bike HOPR program that now exists) and the poor quality of many of the bike racks on campus, which have been upgraded or are still in the process of being upgraded and/or expanded,” Neptune said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The significant changes made over the last few years, including the addition of new biking paths and bike parking spots, led to UCSB achieving the new award, Neptune said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A major factor in UCSB earning Platinum this year [is] the outcomes they were able to show: 43% of students who live off campus use a bike to commute to campus, which is huge compared to what most schools see,” Neptune said. </span><b> </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the new improvements build upon the deep-rooted bike culture that has been present on campus for decades, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The presence of dedicated bike infrastructure, including 20,000 bike parking spots, 9 bike-only roundabouts, 3 bike-only underpasses, and the network of dedicated bike paths throughout the campus, [is] also a major factor [for the Platinum BFU designation].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jamey Wagner, manager of the Transportation Alternatives Program, said that UC Santa Barbara began to develop its bicycle system in the 1960s, stating that the campus has “continued bicycle infrastructure innovation for over 50 years” and that the A.S. Bike Shop has been in operation for over 45 years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wagner added that the HOPR Bike Share program, which launched at UCSB in 2018, has seen significant improvement since 2015, when UCSB was last assessed as a bike-friendly university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most recent data shows that, with the addition of hundreds of shareable bikes, the HOPR program now has 1000 semi-regular users, according to Wagner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, in the last four years, the UCSB Sustainability Program has been partnering with the A.S. Bike Committee to provide bike safety training and bike-lot clearing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student initiatives played the largest role [in achieving platinum status], this was aided by the diversity in spaces such as the Associated Students Bike Committee and the A.S. Bike Shop</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” Wagner explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neptune added that over the past year, the Sustainable Transportation Committee has been working on a master transportation plan for the campus, which includes improvements to bike infrastructure. This plan was included in UCSB’s application to become a bike-friendly university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new bike plan promises changes and improvements to infrastructure on campus and in I.V., Mo Lovegreen, director of sustainability on campus, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are still in the process of drafting this plan and it will take us the bulk of this academic year to complete it but the idea is that it would help AS BIKES identify areas that need improvement and provide a list of items that need to be addressed,” Lovegreen explained in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plan [looks] into the future and uses what has been thought of and creates what hasn’t been thought of.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91116\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91116\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-receives-platinum-level-honor-for-bike-friendliness/","id":1922,"author":{"id":54,"name":"Nidhi Satyagal"},"related":[1921,1920,1919],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Administration Addresses Students’ Concerns Following Fraternity Sexual Assault Allegations","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-11-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-12-at-12.15.03-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-12-at-12.15.03-AM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The forum was held by the university as an attempt to clarify misinformation regarding the allegations.

A student can submit reports of sexual misconduct — anonymously or not — either online, over the phone, via email or in person; the office will then establish a case file and reach out to the student in order to explain how they can move forward with the case, Alvarez explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, that can only happen if the complainant responds to the office’s follow up, she emphasized, explaining that if students submit through an anonymous report and provide scarce information, it can severely limit the office’s ability to continue a case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes we just have a first name. Sometimes we just have very general information about what happened,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it seems that we have insufficient information, meaning not enough information to move forward with one of those response options, then we may proceed with closure. That doesn’t mean we can’t reopen [the case] when we receive new information in the future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alia Reynolds, president of Students Against Sexual Assault, emphasized to the panel and attendees that communication between the university and students needs to be open at all times “without students having to ask for that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think students need access and communication of this information continuously and constantly, versus sending out updates on everything that’s been done after the fact,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students pressed the panel for answers on what the university is going to do moving forward regarding the allegations against Sigma Pi.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You have answered [with] appropriate actions to take once the investigation is complete,” one student said. “With all due respect, I believe you still haven’t answered the question about what actions are being taken now against these fraternities.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miles Ashlock, acting associate dean and Office of Student Life (OSL) director, said that as soon as the OSL members heard of multiple allegations against fraternities in I.V., they held a meeting with the Interfraternity Council (IFC) to have a “long and very open dialogue about our very explicit concerns about the reports that we had received.” </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You have answered [with] appropriate actions to take once the investigation is complete… With all due respect, I believe you still haven’t answered the question about what actions are being taken now against these fraternities.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The IFC council made a decision immediately in that room… to create a self-imposed moratorium on social events. They originally imposed that for four days, and after that period they reassessed and decided to institute it indefinitely while ongoing discussion and internal rulemaking and conversations with the university administrators and advisors continued,” Ashlock said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn added that the IFC’s ban on parties was just one step in creating a safer environment for students, but another student pointed out that the moratorium would only cut off the liquor and leave the root cause ignored.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[We’re] saying we don’t want to have parties in these houses where people are going to be unsafe,” Klawunn said. “We believed that not having social events in those houses until we could put some safe steps into place was the right direction, and so that’s where we stand.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students voiced similar concerns about the university’s Rape Aggression Defense (R.A.D.) initiative, a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sexual assault defense training program offered through the UC Police Department</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. One student emphasized that getting to the underlying cause of the sexual assaults should be the university’s primary focus, rather than creating defense programs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It seems that the R.A.D. training is the only tangible outcome of what we’ve heard going on  campus, and it seems as though [it’s saying] ‘Let’s train women to defend themselves’ instead of ‘Let’s get to the root of the problem,’” the student said. “There’s a culture, there’s a problem with these criminals out there who are doing this who think it’s okay — and they’re getting away with it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eli Diaz, a second-year pre-economics and accounting major, also voiced his concerns over the language used in the timely warnings, particularly over the word “victim.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I heard Ariana, the Title IX officer, use the word ‘victim’ to refer to survivors and I feel like it’s been widely accepted that ‘victim’ isn’t the right word to use for people that are survivors of sexual violence. That felt like a strong disconnect, especially coming from someone that is from Title IX,” Diaz said in an interview with the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlock explained to forum attendees that the university must be careful when it comes to the use of the term “survivor” compared to “victim” or a neutral term such as “complainant.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we’re trying to hold someone accountable, it actually puts us in a less credible position to use the term ‘survivor.’ We are expected to be neutral, and if our investigators are making this linguistic assumption of the truth, it actually degrades the credibility of the case of the investigation when it goes before a hearing or a trial,” Ashlock said during the forum.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn further mentioned that in the immediate future, the Task Force for Safer Social Events — an ongoing project organized by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assistant Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katya Armistead, Associated Students President Alison Sir and Klawunn — will attempt to bring organizations from all over the community, including IFC, the OSL and the Isla Vista Community Services District, among others, to enact change for students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, one student believed that allowing IFC to take part in the task force could lead to a bias in the task force’s actions, referring back to the self-imposed moratorium. Armistead countered by stating that not including IFC would be counteractive to the change trying to be made. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Here’s the thing, if we’re going to make change, we’ve got to make change all over. And I think it can be really dangerous to not include any entity,” Armistead said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s important that we all work together as a community to make some really positive change.
