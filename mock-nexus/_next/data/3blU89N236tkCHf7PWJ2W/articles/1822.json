However, all appointments have been transferred to virtual Zoom meetings, and 24-hour crisis hotlines remain active. In addition, the C.A.P.S. Mental Health Peer Program is “working on creating virtual Spring 2020 content” to give students an opportunity to connect with peers, according to its </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://caps.sa.ucsb.edu\">website</a>.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, the RCSGD assured students that it would continue to provide them with resources to “support [students] during these trying times.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We assure you that we will still have events and there will be ways to engage with the center and your LGBTQIA+ peers,” a representative from the RCSGD </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RCSGD.UCSB/posts/2592587471012681?__tn__=K-R\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said in a Facebook post</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The post assured students that the RCSGD would be continuing to create spaces for LGBTQIA+ students, as well as linking basic needs resources from other departments.

It’s hard to see the social media posts, and I want to reply even if it isn’t to me, so if you have a concern, please reach out to me and I would be more than happy to talk about it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the UCSB community, Ashlock offered a word of advice to those hesitant to use the new online services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seven billion of us are all facing things that we haven’t before. Give what we’re doing a chance.”  </span></p>\n<p><i>Correction [4/8, 1:10 p.m.]: This article was updated with the correct hyperlink for C.A.P.S.</i></p>\n<p><i>[Correction 4/8/20 7:43 pm]: This article has been corrected to say that all student services are working to transition online.

continue their work, it must be conducted remotely until the outbreak is contained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Researchers were given two days to cease any ongoing on-campus research, according to a </span><a href=\"https://www.research.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/docs/covid-19/Shutdown-of-All-On-Campus-Research-3-18-2020.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">memo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from Incandela sent out on March 18. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The shutdown of on-campus research will create unanticipated delays, which can be cause for significant anxiety for many, and especially junior, researchers,” Incandela wrote in the memo.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While there is no way to escape the loss of time, every effort is being made to assure that these actions will not damage careers or lead to excessive financial hardship,” he continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the memo does provide some exceptions to the remote research mandate, including those who are researching coronavirus.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Requests to allow COVID-19 studies or the continuation of ongoing essential experiments” can be submitted through a form for consideration, the memo read, but “few exceptions [are] to be granted.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research equipment, such as chemicals, are not allowed to be taken off campus. For laboratories or equipment that require continued maintenance or activity, the memo asks researchers to “spell out why and what continued tasks are necessary and identify a minimum number of essential personnel who will be responsible for this critical maintenance.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incandela said funding for researchers’ pay was a concern early on, but that the federal</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> agencies, which provide most of the funding for researchers, would continue to fund research now conducted at home. </span><a href=\"https://www.research.ucsb.edu/covid-19-guidance-proposals-and-awards\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New information</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding employee wages is being made available to researchers as well, Incandela said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mahdi Abu-Omar, a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry whose research focuses on renewable energy, said that despite the shutdown, there’s still a lot of work to be done.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re experimentalists, but there’s work that we do offline in terms of writing papers and preparing and planning and processing data,” Abu-Omar said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Of course not being able to do experiments is holding us back a little bit. But [writing and preparing data] for the next several weeks is manageable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the coronavirus outbreak, Abu-Omar had been anticipating the arrival of a scientist and a professor from overseas this summer, but after UCSB’s research shutdown, “both of these jobs are postponed until we figure out what’s going on,” Abu-Omar said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the shuttering of research on campus, there are still alternatives for student researchers, such as proposing ideas for future projects, Incandela said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students can read and learn a lot about how the research they planned to do is connected to previous results. This is just one example, and I am sure there are many other possibilities like running simulations or brain-storming about something completely new,” Incandela explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This may be an unprecedented period of thought and reflection that brings many new ideas to campus for future research.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
