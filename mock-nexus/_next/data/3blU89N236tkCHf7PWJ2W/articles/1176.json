Clark ended the 2014 season leading in almost every offensive category, finishing with 25 stolen bases, four triples and a .505 slugging percentage. These incredible numbers would earn her Big West Freshman of the Year, First Team-All Big West and Honorable Mention All-Pacific Region.</p>\n<p>Clark began playing softball at the early age of six when her parents signed her up for tee-ball. Her interest in softball was sparked through her older sister, whom she watched play for a year before deciding to pick up the bat herself.</p>\n<p>While Clark’s older sister provided an inspiration for her growing up, she also admired watching pro baseball players, as baseball is one of her favorite sports to watch. There is one player in particular however, who really stands out to Clark.</p>\n<p>“I really admire Adrian Beltre. I grew up as a Dodgers fan back when he was playing for the Dodgers, and I liked the way he would just take a hack,” Clark said.</p>\n<p>Taking a hack would be the motto for Clark as she improved her batting average from a .407 to .438 percentage by the end of her high school career at Monte Vista High School. Before attending Monte Vista High, Clark attended The Woodlands High in Woodlands, Texas where she would have a freshman season much like the one that she would experience later at UCSB.</p>\n<p>While only a freshman in high school, Clark led her team to a district title and was named the district’s Freshman of the Year. She also earned herself a spot on the district’s all-first team and all-academic team.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70636\" style=\"width: 243px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70636\" data-attachment-id=\"70636\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-05/batter-up-clark-swings-her-way-to-success/feat-softball_vsgeorgiatech-20160227-dustinharris-6-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FEAT-Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-DustinHarris-6-web.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"FEAT-Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-DustinHarris-6-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FEAT-Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-DustinHarris-6-web.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FEAT-Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-DustinHarris-6-web.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-70636\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FEAT-Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-DustinHarris-6-web.jpg?resize=233%2C350\" alt=\"After bunting the ball, Kristen Clark prepares to run to first base.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Although softball plays a huge part in Clark’s life, academics have always been a priority. Clark was an honor roll student during all four years of high school, while also being a member of the National Honors Society, the California Scholarship Federation and the French Honors Society. Fortunately, Clark ended up at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“There were a lot of factors that made me choose UC Santa Barbara. Academics was a big thing as well as the athletics part, because I’m a biology major and they obviously have a great program here,” Clark said. “There was a time when I wanted to stop by the campus and look at it, and I got a gut feeling like, ‘wow, I can see myself being here for four years,’ because it’s gorgeous, and I really liked all the coaches in the program.”</p>\n<p>Since making the decision to attend UCSB, Clark has experienced nothing but success on the softball field. In her sophomore year during the 2015 season, Clark was named Second Team All-Big West, tallying the third-most hits in Gaucho history and leading the team with 69.</p>\n<p>Clark also finished the season with a team high nine stolen bases. Throughout conference play, Clark improved her batting average from a .356 to .382 which ranked her sixth in the league.</p>\n<p>Clark’s ability and determination to improve, whether it’s small or large improvements, is at the precipice of her game. Since the beginning of her high school career, Clark has managed to better her softball abilities and improve her game.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always been more of a get on base type of batter,” Clark explained. “And so this past year I’ve really tried to get a bit more power. Against Riverside I hit an over the fence home run so that was a big step for my hitting and offense.”</p>\n<p>Setting such high goals for herself has developed Clark into one of the team’s strongest and most powerful hitters. This year Clark has continued to dominate most offensive categories, leading the team with a .420 batting average, ranking her third in the conference, and an excellent .480 on base percentage.</p>\n<p>She also leads the Gauchos with 37 runs scored this season, and 17 stolen bases, ranking her seventh in conference standings. Since the beginning of Clark’s softball career at UCSB, Clark has inspired her teammates with not only her numbers at the plate, but her drive and determination to succeed both on and off the field. As a junior, she will have huge expectations put on her by the team for her next year.  There is little doubt that Kristen Clark will be ready to meet the challenge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 5, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>The early preseason exhibition gave the Gauchos their first look at a new lineup that has five new players in the starting lineup and at least nine overall.</p>\n<p>It didn’t take long for them to get off the mark in the new year as in the 12th minute sophomore midfielder Ismaila Jome pushed the ball up the middle before delivering a gorgeous through ball on the right side to McKenna. The senior’s initial one-time shot was saved by Westmont’s junior goalkeeper Josh Glover, but the rebound fell right back to McKenna who scored an easy goal after regaining his balance.</p>\n<p>UCSB proceeded to dominate possession for the rest of the first half with the Warriors continually attempting to catch the Gauchos on the break with unsuccessful long balls. Jome and McKenna were the best players on the field as they continued to put pressure on the Westmont back four, sending in dangerous crosses on multiple occasions.</p>\n<p>After Jome won a corner in the 25th minute, McKenna put in a cross from the left corner flag that found a sky-high Murphy placing a header perfectly into the bottom right corner of the net. The goal gave UCSB a 2-0 lead that would remain intact until the final whistle, but the chances were not done.</p>\n<p>The second half told a different story from the Westmont perspective, as the Warriors tried to capitalize on several sloppy clearances and turnovers in play by UCSB defenders. However, sophomore goalkeeper Josh McNeely luckily didn’t need to record a single save on the night to preserve the shut out with Westmont attackers consistently missing the target on open looks.</p>\n<p>“I think [the second half] was good. The game opened up and we had a ton of opportunities,” McKenna said. “It could’ve turned into 3, 4, or 5 but you’re not always gonna score all your chances. I thought it was good that we were getting chances and it showed that we have a lot of firepower going forward.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos found themselves with more than one great chance to score, most notably on a breakaway in the 72nd minute when sophomore forward Armand Bagramyan had his one-on-one shot saved by the keeper. Bagramyan had a team-high five shots, as many as the entire Westmont team, as he led a bench mob that played for much of the second half.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re pretty far along,” McKenna said. “Obviously we have a group of 9 players coming in so it will take some time for them to get used to the college atmosphere and game but I think we’re ready to go down to South Carolina and perform well and win games.”</p>\n<p>Next weekend will see UCSB travel to South Carolina to play the College of Charleston at 4:30 p.m. on Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55979\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-24/gauchos-claim-victory-in-season-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55979\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-24/gauchos-claim-victory-in-season-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-24/gauchos-claim-victory-in-season-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-24/gauchos-claim-victory-in-season-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-24/gauchos-claim-victory-in-season-opener/","id":1173,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1172,1171,1170],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Top Seed at Stake: No. 42 UCSB Faces No. 44 Cal Poly in Reg.

The Gauchos also currently stand at a .762 win percentage and will remain above the .700 mark no matter the result of this weekend’s meet.</p>\n<p>Recently, the Gauchos have found strength in their singles play consistency. Their doubles play, however, has averaged out as an even split throughout the month of April.</p>\n<p>As for Cal Poly, they currently stand at a 16-6 overall on the season following their pair of conference wins also against UC Irvine, 5-2, and UC Riverside, 6-1. The Mustangs are currently ranked No. 44 on the ITA standings, a one-spot improvement on their previous No. 45 overall rank. Beginning in early March, Cal Poly was on an eight-game win streak before falling to UC Davis, for its first conference loss on April 2. The Mustangs currently have one ranked doubles team of Corey Pang and Ben Donovan, who are No. 55 in the nation. Donovan is also No. 113 on the ITA singles play rankings.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly has been on a roll in doubles competition, as they have yet to lose a contest throughout the month of April. In terms of their most recent loss against UC Davis, the Mustangs weren’t able to find singles play consistency early on, thus earning themselves their only loss since March 5.</p>\n<p>The result of this final regular season and Big West Conference meet will decide the first and second-place standings in the league. Regardless, both the first and second-place seeds will receive a first-round bye in the Big West Conference Tournament. The winner of the fourth versus fifth-place match will then face off against the first-place seed, while the winner of the third versus sixth-place match will play against the second-place seed.</p>\n<p>This weekend’s matchup against Cal Poly will also act as UCSB’s senior day. There are currently only two seniors on the team; the Gauchos will be honoring Morgan Mays and Teague Hamilton.</p>\n<p>The Blue-Green rivalry of UCSB versus Cal Poly is set to occur this Saturday, April 22 at 2 p.m. at home in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the April 20, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>The high energy was clear amongst the UCSB squad, who fed off one another’s focus in their final home series of the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were bolstered over the weekend by strong performances from senior infielder Arianna Palomares, amassing 5 RBI and two doubles, junior infielder Emily Brucelas, slugging five hits in eleven at-bats to go along with 3 RBI, and junior designated hitter Jacqueline Hinojosa, totaling 5 hits, 2 runs and 1 RBI over eight weekend at-bats.</p>\n<p>On Sunday’s senior day double-header, the Gauchos and Rainbow Wahine split their two games, with the Gauchos winning the first 9-5.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine avoided the sweep by winning the second contest 4-1 on the back of a brilliant pitching performance from sophomore Brittany Hitchcock.</p>\n<p>In the day’s first leg, the scoring started in the bottom of the second with a leadoff shot over the left field fence for first-year infielder Sierra Altmeyer which gave the Gauchos a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>A wild pitch by UCSB senior Ashley Ludlow in the top of the third tied the game at one, and the Rainbow Wahine would go on to take the lead after a three-run inning in the top of the fourth making the score 4-1.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos came roaring back, however, not wanting to be denied on an emotional day such as senior day.</p>\n<p>Junior outfielder Jacqueline Hinojosa singled up the middle to load the bases before junior center fielder Stacy Cavazos ripped another single to center field to score Tetzlaff and Altmeyer to close the gap at 4-3.</p>\n<p>UCSB was not done, as after sophomore right fielder Jessica Johnston bunted the two baserunners over, first year shortstop Melanie Menor singled to bring home both Cavazos and Hiojosa, giving the Gauchos four runs in the inning and the lead which stood at 5-4.</p>\n<p>Despite a hard hit leadoff double from junior pitcher Kanani Aina Cabrales, part of a mass substation for the Rainbow Wahine in the previous inning, Ashley Wright was able to retire the side, helped by a great snag and throw at third base by Emily Brucelas for the inning’s final out.</p>\n<p>The bottom of the fifth frame proved to be fortuitous for the Gauchos, beginning with a walk for Jessica Tetzlaff. Jacqueline Hinojosa then bunted down the third base line, reaching first on an error by the first year infielder Nicole Lopez. Stacy Cavazos came though again with a shot to the left-center warning track, where first year center fielder Sarah Muzik ran into the wall trying to catch the ball.</p>\n<p>After Jessica Johnston reached on a fielders choice with Tetzlaff being thrown out at home, Melanie Menor beat out a ranging throw from the shortstop Ojala to score Hinojosa from third.</p>\n<p>In the next at-bat, a fly ball off the bat of Arianna Palomares was dropped by left fielder Ulu Matagiese, allowing both Jessica Johnston and Stacy Cavazos to score making the score 8-4.</p>\n<p>Senior catcher Samantha Stark walked to bring up junior Emily Brucelas, who drove one up the middle to score Melanie Menor and what would be her team’s final run.</p>\n<p>Hawai’i scored on a wild pitch the next inning, but no rally was in store as the Gauchos won the first Saturday contest 9-5, the win going to pitcher Ashley Wright.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos did not fair as well in the second leg of the double header, losing 4-1 as sophomore pitcher Brittany Hitchcock went the full seven innings, allowing only six hits, one unearned run, and no walks to go along with four strikeouts.</p>\n<p>A masterful performance, Hitchcock made up for a rough outing on Friday by hitting all her spots while in the circle.</p>\n<p>For UCSB, first-year pitcher Veronica Gulvin was passable, allowing three runs in four and a third innings before being replaced by Ashley Ludlow, who closed the game in more concise fashion than her shaky start in the previous game.</p>\n<p>Four runs were plenty for the Rainbow Wahine, however, as sophomore catcher Rachel Lack’s two run homer in the third inning proved to be enough for the victory on its own putting them up 2-0. Lack would also drive in first-year left fielder Jennifer Iseri on a fifth inning single making the score 3-0.</p>\n<p>A late rally in the sixth gave the Gauchos a glimmer of hope, as senior Arianna Palomares started the action with a blooper to right field, just past the outstretched arm of Tayana Mata at second base.</p>\n<p>With Stark on second and Brucelas on first, Altmeyer rocketed one to center field, scoring Stark which made the score 3-1 in favor of the visiting team.</p>\n<p>The Friday 9-3 Gaucho victory was decided in the bottom of the third frame,</p>\n<p>where with two outs and Jessica Tetzlaff on second, back to back doubles from Melanie Menor and Arianna Palomare gave UCSB a 3-1 advantage.</p>\n<p>After Sierra Altmeyer loaded the bases with a grounder into to left field, Jacqueline Hinojose singled up the middle to score Stark, making the score 5-1 Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Another three runs in the bottom of the sixth juxtaposed by Hawaii’s one run in the top of the inning gave UCSB a large cushion at 8-2 and let them coast to the solid win.</p>\n<p>Despite losing the final game of the series Saturday afternoon, the Gauchos were still in good spirits for their senior celebration.</p>\n<p>With parents, family members, and friends galore, the Gauchos honored both the Rainbow Wahine seniors, as well as five of their own: Ashley Ludlow, Jessica Tetzlaff, Alex Pingree, Arianna Palomares, and Samantha Stark.</p>\n<p>The weight of their accomplishments during four years at UCSB was staggering, especially when read aloud over the loudspeaker.</p>\n<p>“It was a fun ride,” said senior catcher Samantha Stark, looking back on her time at UCSB. She continued, “we ended it with a bang,” and in relation to the final two series on the road, she declared plainly, “we’ve got nothing to lose. We just want to keep fighting and take these series.”</p>\n<p>After the game, the head coach of the UCSB softball team had nothing but praises to share about the graduating seniors.</p>\n<p>“The seniors have stepped it up in the past couple of weeks.” Coach Galicinao said. “They’ve been great leaders, not only on the field, but just keeping everybody focused.”</p>\n<p>She continued, explaining, “it’s easier to stay engaged and compete when you’re one of the top two teams, but our team has been really consistent in their effort and in how they’ve been competing, and a lot of that has to do with senior leadership.”</p>\n<p>First-year Sierra Altmeyer noted that the younger players, including herself, “have become really close with the seniors,” and that they were, “just doing it for them.”</p>\n<p>The camaraderie was more obvious than ever for the UCSB softball team on Saturday, as a tight-knit group of players came together to win the final home series of the 2016 season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is a doubleheader against UC Davis Saturday, May 7 beginning at 1 p.m. with the second game starting at 3 p.m. at La Rue Field.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70582\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/gauchos-win-final-home-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70582\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/gauchos-win-final-home-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/gauchos-win-final-home-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/gauchos-win-final-home-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-02/gauchos-win-final-home-series/","id":1175,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[1174,1173,1172],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
