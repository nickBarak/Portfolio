The students were urged to click on a provided link, which would send them to a website where they could type their username and password to retrieve their email account.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scammers are reaching UCSB email accounts through “phishing,” a multi-billion-dollar underground illegal business in which scammers send forged emails to a pool of email users and wait for users to respond to the message. While Sanchez did not respond to the “phishing” bait, many students did, releasing their usernames and passwords and allowing their accounts to be used in other phishing attempts by scammers.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this month, a similar email was sent to UCSB staff, and 16 members released their login information to the dangerous site. These unsecure emails are not the first of their kind and pose a variety of threats to email users. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once scammers have a username and login, they could use it as a gateway to access other accounts or look into students’ academic and personal records.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Sam Horowitz, UCSB’s chief information security officer, phishing is “very common and fairly easy to do.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are bad guys in the world,” Horowitz said. “This is kind of the nature of what email and criminal … activity look like today.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phishing is common in many countries, including those formerly part of the Eastern Block and some unexpected countries such as Germany and the United States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of former Soviet countries are places we see hotbeds of activity,” said Joe McClain, the director of student systems I.T. infrastructure, security &amp; user support of UCSB’s Student Systems and Technology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Of course, China is on the list; there’s a lot of stuff happening in China, but there’re also countries you would never expect that would show up on the radar.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McClain said unsecure emails are becoming more “sophisticated” to look like emails sent from legitimate organizations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When spammers go phishing, they are throwing a lure out there to see how many people bite on it,” McClain said. The more refined the email, the more likely people will trust it and release personal information.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spammers are not only interested in accessing singular email addresses, but look for addresses that are trusted and widely used, like the umail server. The level of this spam only appears to be rising. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McClain said there are “hundreds of thousands” of spam emails sent to the university’s many departments daily. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s getting worse because it works … they can throw a message out there, and people click the link and give out their usernames and passwords,” McClain said. “If people didn’t do it, it wouldn’t be worthwhile.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university is always making improvements to the security systems in each department, but McClain notes in some cases it is easier to secure administration and business department emails on campus than academic departments.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The faculty typically wants things to be wide open, they want to be able to whatever they want to do … and the faculty have tremendous weight on campus,” McClain said. “So there are only so many things we can do to provide controls on systems used on the academic research side.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Horowitz sent an email to students Friday in response to the phishing attacks with suggestions about how to avoid getting trapped in a phishing attempt, such as being aware of who the email is coming from or what the email looks like.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also advised students to be “skeptical” of messages that seem “too good to be true, the consequences [are] too dire [or there’s a] sense of urgency.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, Sanchez and many other students refrained from giving their login information to the unsecure email sent last week. Horowitz said he hopes that with increased education about the danger of these phishing emails, fewer students and faculty will even consider opening the illicit messages.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an important thing, [and] it needs to be dealt with,” he said. “This stuff happens, and you need to protect yourself.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72015\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72015\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/","id":2472,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2471,2470,2469],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox","biography":"Not available","articles":[2252,2253,2310,2323,2350,2353,2354,2361,2362,2363,2365,2366,2367,2373,2379,2389,2398,2402,2414,2415,2423,2434,2442,2445,2462,2467,2471,2472,2479,2480,2487,2517,2522,2524,2545,2570,2576,2617,2636,2672,2714,2719,2721,2741,2832,3427,3587,3656,3746,3751,3770,3771,3802,3916,3917,3949,3955,3957,3966,4368,4370,4385,4443,4588,4611,4631,4808,7224],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UC Allocates $3.3 Million to Increase Student Access to Food","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-07-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/unspecified.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/unspecified.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Juli Nguyen, who will begin her fourth year in the fall, has struggled with food insecurity since her first year at UC Santa Barbara.

She said she often found it difficult to focus on her schoolwork when she was so hungry that she felt nauseous.</p>\n<p>“One of my main concerns was worrying about not being able to focus on studying for an exam because I was hungry,” Nguyen said in an email. “It’s quite difficult to make the best out of your education when you’re focused on how you’re going to get access to your next meal [or] cook for your next meal.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen’s story is similar to the realities of many other UC students who find it hard to eat healthy and consistently with a college budget and rigorous student lifestyle.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The only way to reduce stigma around hunger is to start with your own personal narrative.”</p>\n<p>— Juli Nguyen</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to a spring 2015 survey from the UC, which was taken by 8,932 of 66,000 UC students, 42 percent of UC students struggled with poor quality food and insufficient sustenance in the past year.</p>\n<p>In response to the survey results, President Janet Napolitano announced Monday that she will allocate $3.3 million of the UC funds to help students struggling with food insecurity on behalf of the university’s Global Food Initiative. Each campus will receive $151,000 of the allocated amount.</p>\n<p>Among the focuses of the Global Food Initiative’s plan, the UC mentions the expansion of campus’ food pantry storage and access, an increase of student registration in CalFresh, the state’s nutrition assistance program and improved financial communication about the cost of food and living for students.</p>\n<p>Paul Monge, a UC Berkeley law student, UCSB alumnus and Student Regent designate, will work with Napolitano on projects to increase food security and said it is important for universities to receive more funding from the state rather than relying primarily on student tuition.</p>\n<p>“The university system is increasingly reliant on tuition and fees as their main source of revenue as opposed to state revenue,” Monge said. “The burden of paying for the universities … is placed on students and how that is translating is increase in prevalence of food insecurity.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61697\"

funding support the food bank’s expansion, adding that the current lack of funding is “keeping us from providing more for students that need it the most.”</p>\n<p>The survey also showed that 57 percent of students who now go hungry did not experience food problems during childhood, making this an even more “serious issue,” according to Katie Maynard, the UCSB Sustainability Coordinator.</p>\n<p>“Students may require additional information about crisis resources, financial aid, and making healthy choices on a limited budget” as they handle food inaccessibility for the first time, Maynard said in an email.</p>\n<p>Many students do not feel comfortable seeking assistance on the issue, however, causing them to “struggle in privacy,” Nguyen said.</p>\n<p>“I think what many of us don’t realize is that hunger can happen to anyone at any single time,” she said in an email. “If you go into I.V., it’s packed with people eating delicious food at a bunch of restaurants, but we don’t account for the percentage of students who are currently at home and hungry.”</p>\n<p>Maynard said UCSB’s Food Security Task Force will manage the $151,000 allocated to UCSB and plan to prioritize more options for low-income students, including the Certified Farmers’ Market and associated Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The way that we talk about affordability is often limited to fees and tuition, but I think we need to think about affordability in all aspects of a students’ life.”</p>\n<p>— Paul Monge</p></blockquote>\n<p>She also said the task force will hire eight students so they can analyze solutions offered at other campuses and expand existing programs.</p>\n<p>According to Monge, the cost of housing and food security is not typically associated with the affordability of college, which leads to a system wide lack of focus on students’ wellbeing.</p>\n<p>“The way that we talk about affordability is often limited to fees and tuition, but I think we need to think about affordability in all aspects of a students’ life,” Monge said. “We really need to reframe the narrative about what the university has responsibility over in terms of … students.”</p>\n<p>Despite being an upperclassman who uses the A.S. Food Bank, Nguyen finds herself struggling to make food a priority in her busy schedule. The news of the new UC initiative “excites” her and she hopes it will increase discussion about a battle that so many students fight each day.</p>\n<p>“The only way to reduce stigma around hunger is to start with your own personal narrative,” Nguyen said in an email. “I’m glad that [food insecurity] is getting the attention it needs and I hope this attention becomes more and more public as we progress.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71895\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-14/uc-allocates-3-3-million-to-increase-student-access-to-food/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71895\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-14/uc-allocates-3-3-million-to-increase-student-access-to-food/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-14/uc-allocates-3-3-million-to-increase-student-access-to-food/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-14/uc-allocates-3-3-million-to-increase-student-access-to-food/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-14/uc-allocates-3-3-million-to-increase-student-access-to-food/","id":2471,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2470,2469,2468],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Vagina Monologues & Herstories To Bring Excitement, Discomfort, Inclusion","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Vagina-Monologues_for-02.09_Alex-Gonzalez-3-4-of-1-e1392025457993.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Vagina-Monologues_for-02.09_Alex-Gonzalez-3-4-of-1-e1392025457993.jpg?resize=600%2C384&ssl=1","description":"Students who were taken aback by animate vaginas wandering through The Arbor can expect tears, laughter and storytelling from the Women’s Ensemble Theatre Troupe this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who were taken aback by animate vaginas wandering through the Arbor can expect tears, laughter and storytelling from the Women’s Ensemble Theatre Troupe this weekend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group will present The Vagina Monologues &amp; Herstories on Friday at 7:30 p.m. and Saturday at 2 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. to explore the realm of “BDSM, immigration, the gaming industry for women and so much more” according to Bridget Kyeremateng, director and fourth-year black studies and feminist studies double major.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Vagina Monologues &amp; Herstories at UCSB offers an insightful look into the feminine experience. All proceeds from the event will be donated to the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unique to UCSB is the inclusion of herstories, a storytelling portion built on students’ experiences. According to Kyeremateng, UCSB may discontinue The Vagina Monologues  in coming years to focus solely on Herstories. Herstories involves first-hand prose written by students, creating an even stronger bond with the campus and community. The portion will be directed by Rachel Gregory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Kyeremateng’s key influences on the production has been the addition of diversity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The feminist movement is rising, and Herstories brings up a more diverse cast that The Vagina Monologues tend to not have,” Kyeremateng, who is a veteran of the production, said. “Looking back, the troupe was not as diverse as it could have been.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The show stresses the importance of representation, she said, with this year’s cast including a bigender member for the first time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While The Vagina Monologues alone are wonderfully informative, Kyeremateng said the name can exclude certain experiences; for example, someone who identifies as a woman may not be able to participate in childbirth, thus excluding LGBTQ+ identities. Kyeremateng is also performing her own prose piece this year on being an undocumented black woman in the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophie Swezey, an actress working on the monologue “The Vagina Workshop” said her piece is about a middle-aged woman who goes to a “vagina workshop” to learn more about her vagina and how to make herself orgasm. She goes through a transformational experience</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> finds her clitoris and ultimately learns how to make herself orgasm.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We live in a society that tends to discourage women from exploring themselves, touching themselves, and talking about their vaginas,” she said in an email. “I think in essence that’s the most powerful part of The Vagina monologues — that women are talking about their experiences and discussing ‘taboo topics.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While never having had this woman’s exact experience, Swezey identifies with her character in terms of self-confidence and comfort with one’s body, issues many women face.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Vagina Monologues intend to be a uniting and empowering show for women, but Kyeremateng said, “It’s not exclusive to just women; in order for the feminist movement to work, we need to get our allies involved.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those who are uncomfortable attending an event where women openly discuss vaginas, actress Rose Houska said, “It’s okay to be uncomfortable. These are things we are not ‘supposed’ to talk about, so naturally it’s [going to] be uncomfortable.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tickets can be found online <a href=\"https://events.ucsb.edu/org/os/wett\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, at the A.S.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former UCSB student Daniel J. Chen was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/former-student-arrested-in-2014-campus-rape-case/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arrested</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in San Ramon on Feb. 10, 2016 and charged with two counts of rape and is currently being held without bail in the Santa Barbara County Jail awaiting trial. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the lawsuit, the UC Regents motioned to strike four specific portions of its text, saying the allegations were not valid enough to carry out legal action.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Santa Barbara Superior Court Judge Donna Geck on June 28 overruled the Regent’s challenge with </span><a href=\"http://www.sbcourts.org/os/tr/tentative-detail.php?RuleID=48964\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">support</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for each of the plaintiff’s allegations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among four claims, the Regents said the lawsuit did not explain how the foliage-covered area created a “forseeable risk” for the plaintiff’s injuries. The lawsuit, however, alleges that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the university had “previously received several complaints that crimes had occurred in this area.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These are more than sufficient allegations to support the inference that it was foreseeable that a student walking in the area, particularly a female student, might be the victim of a sexual assault or other criminal activity,” the court ruled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents also argued that the plaintiff failed to explain how the area was dangerous and describe how the “dangerous condition” led to the plaintiff’s injuries. The court rejected both of the arguments and the the lawsuit will proceed in its original form. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents had approximately 10 days to respond to the court’s ruling, and the plaintiff and defendant will now begin negotiating whether the case will go to trial or end with a settlement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tyrone Maho, an attorney representing the plantiff, said the woman is still hoping for a settlement in the case.</span></p>\n<p>“She wants accountability, not just by the people that did this to her, but for the university to allow this dangerous condition to exist,” he said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attorneys representing both parties will hold the next status conference on Sept. 16. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71854\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-09/regents-challenge-to-campus-rape-case-fails/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71854\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-09/regents-challenge-to-campus-rape-case-fails/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-09/regents-challenge-to-campus-rape-case-fails/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-09/regents-challenge-to-campus-rape-case-fails/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-09/regents-challenge-to-campus-rape-case-fails/","id":2470,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2469,2468,2467],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
