","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In this editor’s introduction, I’m supposed to give you guys facts about who I am and what activities I do that are supposed to define me. Instead of writing about that, I’m going to give a little pep talk to all the students at UCSB, and hopefully that will better reflect who I am and how I feel as I finish my final year in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>For a good portion of students, today is the first day of school at a four-year university. Lucky for you guys, that university is UCSB, the most beautiful and fun place to go to college in the world. If you oppose that message, let me just say, you’re out of your mind. No other school features such a beautiful mix of weather, scenery and people as UCSB, and as you may have heard, Gauchos know how to party. These next few years of life at UCSB are going to seem like a dream at times.</p>\n<p>Factor in that we are a top-level university considered a “public Ivy,” and there is no other university that helps develop well-balanced individuals that know how to work hard and play even harder.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I’m a senior and I’m tired of hearing freshmen say they are sad to be at UCSB because they didn’t get into a better school. Guess what, this is a blessing in disguise. If you haven’t enjoyed your time at UCSB, it is because you haven’t found the right group of people. Partying isn’t for everyone, but who needs partying when you have beautiful people, beaches and mountains surrounding you everywhere you look.</p>\n<p>During my three years as a Gaucho thus far, I can say I have changed tremendously as a person. College is the time when you are supposed to have fun and make some mistakes, it is just a matter of keeping those mistakes to a minimum and making sure they never get in the way of your future endeavors.</p>\n<p>Through experiences with the <em>Nexus</em> (which you should read everyday) and my business fraternity Alpha Kappa Psi (which you should all rush this fall), I’ve learned hard work pays off in big ways. Join clubs, experience new things and enjoy the shit out of life in college.</p>\n<p>Go to UCSB athletic events and cheer on the Gauchos because it is truly something special to call yourself one. And I better see all of you on Friday at Harder Stadium! The first soccer game of the year is always fun and whether you decide to go sober or drunk out of your mind, make sure you cheer for our team.</p>\n<p>The Thunderdome can truly be thunderous when students pack the stands, but it is up to us as Gauchos to bring the party wherever we go. Hold that fun, yet driven atmosphere through all phases of life and never forget the way you felt as Gauchos during college.</p>\n<p>And learn how to hate Cal Poly. We are superior in pretty much any way you can think of. Better looking students? Check. Better athletic teams and academics? Check. Better party scene and surrounding nature? Without a question.</p>\n<p>All I can say entering my senior year is, enjoy your time in the most beautiful place to attend college because before you know it, it will be gone. Be proud to be a Gaucho. Enjoy this year and I’ll catch all you beautiful people on Del Playa.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Here’s to a rowdy year,</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Paul-Michael</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of September 26, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of </em>the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52055\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome-paul-michael-ochoa/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52055\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome-paul-michael-ochoa/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome-paul-michael-ochoa/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome-paul-michael-ochoa/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome-paul-michael-ochoa/","id":2095,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[2094,2093,2092],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[254,318,354,366,518,519,527,533,535,538,539,546,548,551,554,555,558,561,567,570,574,576,577,578,589,592,594,596,605,609,613,618,623,630,633,638,640,647,650,651,653,654,656,660,661,668,670,673,677,683,694,700,703,706,708,710,717,719,724,727,798,809,814,828,833,847,849,851,853,854,856,857,858,863,867,868,870,874,877,879,880,882,884,886,887,889,892,894,899,900,902,904,905,915,920,1259,1565,1566,1567,1568,1569,1570,1571,1575,1578,1581,1583,1584,1587,1590,1591,1594,1599,1601,1603,1606,1607,1608,1611,1623,1626,1652,1666,1668,1669,1670,1674,1675,1685,1689,1691,1692,1697,1762,1763,1765,2063,2069,2095,2142,2158,3169,3185,3190,3226,3229,3231,3232,3238,3244,3249,3256,4448,4494,4522,4523,4524,4526,4531,4539,4541,4544,4545,4546,4549,4550,4551,4554,4567,5189,5193,5194,5209,5396,5399,5400,5402,5403,5404,5405,5406,5407,5409,5417,5418,5419,5420,5421,5422,5423,5424,5425,5426,5427,5428,5429,5430,5431,5436,5448,5449,5450,5502,5530,5536],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Stalking, Extortion Scams Targeting International Students, UCPD Reports","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The first report was received by the department on April 30.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than one international student has reported stalking and extortion scams to the UC Police Department in the past two months, according to a timely warning sent out to all UC Santa Barbara students Tuesday afternoon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first report was received by the department on April 30.

I may be slightly biased, but UCSB really is the best. My three years here thus far have been memorable in so many ways.</p>\n<p>One reason for this, of course, is because of its sports. I’m now entering my fourth year with the <em>Nexus</em> as a writer and my second as an editor, so I’ve covered most of the sports here. We may not be a sports powerhouse, but we’re still DI and have some spectacular teams.</p>\n<p>Our men’s water polo team is currently ranked No. 6. The men’s basketball team features the Preseason Big West Player of the Year Alan Williams and the women’s basketball team has reached the postseason for the past two seasons. Our baseball team made the NCAA Tournament last year too. I could go on and on, but trust me, there’s something for everyone.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For those of you concerned that there is no football, I promise you won’t mind. We have real fútbol (a.k.a. soccer), and it’s absolutely fantastic. UCSB isn’t known as soccer heaven for nothing. Last year, the team was ranked as highly as No. 3 in the nation.</p>\n<p>So go to the first game of the year tomorrow against Stanford and give it a try. My first ever soccer game as a freshman was against UCLA. UCSB won 2-0 in a tremendous upset in front of what was basically a sold-out crowd. We set the NCAA record for attendance at a soccer game with 15,896 people, the majority throwing tortillas in celebration. It is one of my favorite memories at UCSB, so I’d love to see all incoming students have a similar experience.</p>\n<p>As for a bit about me, I am a communication major, Spanish minor who would love to turn sports journalism into a career. All my life, sports have been my thing. Most girls have celebrities or pictures of friends on their bedroom walls; I have pictures of basketball players.</p>\n<p>Personally, I think basketball is the best sport on the planet. Whether it’s playing, watching or writing it, men or women, pro, college or any other level, I love this game.</p>\n<p>Coming from the Sac Town area, my favorite team is the Sacramento Kings. I’m extremely excited to see what they do in what’s been deemed a new era. Also, all of you should know that while I currently reside in Laker territory, there’s no saying I love more than ‘beat LA.’</p>\n<p>What makes me different than most basketball fans, and sports fans in general though, is that I prefer the women’s game. I’m currently glued to the television right now with the WNBA playoffs in full swing.</p>\n<p>I grew up playing a bunch of sports year-round, but my dream was always to play in the WNBA. When I realized that wasn’t going to happen, I figured if I couldn’t play for them, I’d write for them.</p>\n<p>And with my love for sports, it didn’t take long for me to fall in love with sports writing. I wrote my first sports piece at 14, and with every article, I fall more and more deeply in love. As tough as it can be putting the sports section together at 1 a.m. sometimes, I do truly adore my job. Plus, I’m extremely proud to say I’m part of a college paper that is ranked No. 9 in the U.S.</p>\n<p>So Gauchos, if you’re a sports lover like me, come see us. Challenge our articles online or, even better, come write for us. Otherwise, I’ll see you tomorrow at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Have a great year,</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Kristen</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of September 26, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52053\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52053\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome/","id":2094,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[2093,2092,2091],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Bike Committee worked with Bike Committee Senate Liaison and On-Campus Senator Yash Nagpal to develop the resolution.</p>\n<p>The resolution includes a letter written by the Associated Students (A.S.) Bike Committee, which oversees maintenance of campus bicycle infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The letter criticizes the lack of bicycle parking and infrastructure in the newest design plan for the Student Resource Building (SRB) North Landscaping Design Project. The development plan for the lawn area north of the SRB and south of the bike path would provide more space in the SRB and expand outdoor study space, according to the letter.</p>\n<p>Wednesday’s vote is in solidarity with the A.S. Bike Committee’s letter, and directs the SRB Governance Board to consider their request to put the project on hold until the design includes improvements to the SRB’s bicycle system.</p>\n<p>The resolution emphasizes how the current bicycle parking situation at the SRB threatens the safety of the campus. Because the bicycle parking lot for the Theater and Dance West building is across the bike path, accessing the SRB is “challenging and dangerous during peak hours,” according to the letter.</p>\n<p>The letter also stated that current parking “poses a potential congestion problem if either building facility receive greater traffic than usual, which happens every time a major event is held in either space.”</p>\n<p>The Bike Committee first became involved with the North Landscaping Design Project in Spring Quarter 2017, and worked with the SRB Governance Board to add bike parking to their original design.</p>\n<p>“The [previous] design included space for approximately 35 bike parking spaces near the SRB main entrance. This space has been eliminated in the most recent proposal, and the Bike Committee hopes that it will be added back in,” A.S. Bike Committee Chair Annie Golay said to the Nexus.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Student Life and SRB Governance Board Advisor Kim Equinoa said the changes sacrificed more bike parking for programming and study space.</p>\n<p>“The scope was narrowed to include one design area encompassing the grass area north of SRB and south of the bike path. In that transition, the space was designed to maximize programming and study space,” Equinoa said to the Nexus.</p>\n<p>When the A.S. Bike Committee found out the newest design plan did not include new bike space, they wrote a letter directly to the SRB Governance Board detailing why new bike parking is necessary for the SRB.</p>\n<p>“Currently, students who wish to go to the Student Resource Building must park in the bike lot adjacent to the Theater and Dance West building. This poses a potential congestion problem if either building facility receive greater traffic than usual, which happens every time a major event is held in either space,” the letter states.</p>\n<p>In response to the resolution, Equinoa said “the SRB Governance Board is open to receiving any feedback and information that can help inform decisions.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
