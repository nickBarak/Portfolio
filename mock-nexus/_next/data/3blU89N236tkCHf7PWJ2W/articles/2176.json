Senate about instituting mandatory interpersonal violence prevention trainings and tying the requirement to the senators’ honoraria.</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford also spoke with UCPD about increasing the number of CSO safety stations as well as possibly moving the stations’ locations.</p>\n<p>The organization recommended to UCPD that its CSOs present in a less threatening fashion, potentially with t-shirts emphasizing they are student employees versus their regular uniform, which mimics a police outfit.</p>\n<p>“The largest concern that we saw in the survey was the appearance of CSOs. Even though they are not officers, they give an appearance of an official person, official authority,” said Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>“[With t-shirts] they feel more approachable by people who, one, are probably intoxicated, two, might be from marginalized communities who don’t feel comfortable around police personnel.”</p>\n<p>By the end of the night, SASA representatives set up several verbal agreements with the university to increase students’ access to information about interpersonal violence prevention.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The workers, represented by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), protested low wages and job outsourcing, among other issues.</p>\n<p>AFSCME is the the largest union of UC employees in California.</p>\n<p>Juan Donato, a lead groundskeeper who has worked at UCSB for 35 years, spoke during the panel about the strikes and working at UCSB.</p>\n<p>He said he found the AFSCME union to be a channel through which his voice could be heard.</p>\n<p>“Fortunately, UCSB is a public school, so we get to ask questions,” Donato said. “Unfortunately, when I ask questions myself, it doesn’t work. I get muted. But together with the union, we are strong. With the union, I have a voice.”</p>\n<p>Anna Fabian, a fourth-year AFSCME intern, spoke of learning about the labor movement as she went through her four years at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Coming to UCSB, I didn’t know much about the labor movement and I didn’t know about the hypocrisy that happens here,” Fabian said. “We learn so much in our classes about the mistreatment of workers, but it’s happening right outside our classrooms.”</p>\n<p>“After you learn so much about what is happening, you can’t just turn around and not do anything about it.”</p>\n<p>One-fifth of UC workers have faced discrimination in the workplace based on their cultural background, one-third reported not being paid overtime and one-half reported being overworked, according to a survey conducted by USAS.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the majority of workers reported not being paid a living wage.</p>\n<p>AFSCME members said during the panel they will continue to push for change, despite the fact that no changes came out of the October strikes.</p>\n<p>“We may not be able to see the results in our time, but it’s the legacy that I want to leave,” Donato said.</p>\n<p>“For my children, for the children of my grandchildren — in the long term, it is going to be worth it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

id=\"caption-attachment-85022\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Patrisse Cullors spoke at UCSB on Nov. 15. <em>Katelyn Zamudio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The event, put on by the UCSB MultiCultural Center (MCC), has been in the making for nearly nine months, according to MCC Director Zaveeni Khan-Marcus.</p>\n<p>“[Cullors’] voice and the message she gives is so powerful. We felt that it was important for her to come to campus and talk about her experience,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>Cullors, an activist and artist, spoke prominently about the origins of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>\n<p>She discussed how the acquittal of Neighborhood Watch Coordinator George Zimmerman after his killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin caused outrage among those in the black community and beyond.</p>\n<p>“It was a response, it was a guttural response to one of our tragedies of our generation,” Cullors said.</p>\n<p>She condemned Zimmerman’s trial and subsequent acquittal, stating Zimmerman’s defense “[tried] to build a defense that Trayvon Martin deserved to die.”</p>\n<p>Cullors, a native of San Fernando Valley, also spoke about growing up in a community which resented the police and intimately felt the effects of mass incarceration. She highlighted the paradoxes in the American justice system, exemplified by Zimmerman’s not-guilty verdict.</p>\n<p>“I sat with a contradiction of living in a country that has two million people in prison, one million of them black and George Zimmerman, a white-passing Latino, gets to kill a human being and go home free.”</p>\n<p>Fellow activist Alicia Garza’s subsequent coinage of the term “Black Lives Matter” in a Facebook post, and Cullors’ decision to attach a hashtag to it in a post expressing her frustration, led to #BlackLivesMatter becoming a viral phenomenon – and later, a tangible social movement.</p>\n<p>However, Cullors emphasized the continuity of the Black Lives Matter movement with regards to the past.</p>\n<p>“This concept of Black Lives Matter has lineage. It’s a part of the Black Power Movement,” she said. “We stand on the shoulders of giants.”</p>\n<p>Cullors emphasized the importance of becoming involved with issues beyond the confines of social media and fostering relationships with other organizations, such as the Women’s March and the #MeToo movement.</p>\n<p>“Contrary to the media, a hashtag doesn’t start an actual movement. It takes skills, it takes organizing, it takes commitment and it takes sacrifice,” she said.</p>\n<p>For those within the MCC, Cullors’ talk surpassed already-high expectations.</p>\n<p>MCC Program Coordinator Abire Sabbagh expressed relief that Cullors didn’t avoid sensitive topics and instead tackled touchy subjects with grace and eloquence.</p>\n<p>“We’re not going to sugarcoat anything. We’re going to talk about the struggles and we’re going to talk about how hard it is, but we’re also going to talk about what we do and how we build the movement that we need to liberate ourselves,” Sabbagh said.</p>\n<p>Khan-Marcus also admired Cullors’ ability to bring light to the issues by talking about her own personal experiences and how a sense of community and family gave Cullors a refuge from suffering.</p>\n<p>“She talked about all the hardship she went through as a child, but there’s also a sense of love,” Khan-Marcus said. “I’m absolutely thrilled. Her presence itself was incredible.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

resolution, authored by Senator Zion Solomon and seconded by Senator Christian Ornelas, also called for the Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors to reject any and all future oil drilling proposals in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“I’m bringing this issue to Senate because I believe Associated Students can be used as an important platform to use to lobby legislatures [sic] within the community,” Solomon stated in an email to the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>This project includes three separate oil drilling proposals in the Cat Canyon Oil Field, located in northern Santa Barbara county near Santa Maria.</p>\n<p>The first <a href=\"http://www.sbcountyplanning.org/energy/projects/WestCatCanyon.asp\">proposal</a>, from the Texas-based ERG Operating Company, would add new injection wells, drilling pads and processing facilities, as well as expand current pads.</p>\n<p>In the second <a href=\"http://www.sbcountyplanning.org/energy/projects/AERAEastCatCanyon.asp\">proposal</a>, the Shell and ExxonMobil company AERA would drill new oil wells via “steam fracking.”</p>\n<p>The third <a href=\"http://www.sbcountyplanning.org/energy/projects/PetroRockUCCB.asp#documents\">proposal</a> by PetroRock would also add new steam injection wells.</p>\n<p>In total, the project would add more than 750 new intensive oil wells in Cat Canyon, <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/los-padres/santa-barbara/fighting-fracking-and-extreme-oil\">according</a> to the Santa Barbara chapter of the Sierra Club.</p>\n<p>The resolution also calls on both Associated Students (A.S.) Senate members and Boards, Committees and Units (BCUs) with environmental mission statements — including the Environmental Affairs Board, Human Rights Board and Coastal Fund — to write letters to the Board of Supervisors declaring their opposition.</p>\n<p>The resolution also asks Chancellor Henry T. Yang to “reaffirm his previous commitments against fossil fuels” by issuing a statement against the project.</p>\n<p>“[The resolution] will both pressure our elected officials on a bigger scale and give environmental lobbyists more weight when they’re talking to the Board of Directors making this decision,” Solomon stated in an email to the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday’s meeting, the resolution’s student sponsors — fourth-year environmental studies and Chicana and Chicano studies major Amanda Pantoja and second-year computer science major Dylan Kupsh — both emphasized the importance of students speaking out and signing petitions against the proposals.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the supervisors got in because of student efforts, so we want them to hear what we have to say,” Pantoja said. “UCSB itself is one of the greenest campuses. I want to ensure we reflect our green values in the community.”</p>\n<p>Pantoja pointed out during the meeting that the Cat Canyon Proposals contradict California State Senate bill <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB100\">100</a>, which puts California on the path for 100 percent fossil fuel-free electricity by 2045.</p>\n<p>“Going with these projects would go against what Santa Barbara and Goleta have voted for,” she added.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors will vote on these measures in early 2019, according to Kupsh. Currently, the supervisors are editing proposed Final Environmental Impact Reports.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
