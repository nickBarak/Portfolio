But for Toronto Raptors’ superstar Kawhi Leonard, the past 10 months have been some of the most agonizing any NBA player has faced in the modern era. Forget 10 months; 10 days is all it took for the beloved San Antonio forward to have a fall from grace previously unseen in not just the NBA but the sports world altogether. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decorated superstar had come into the 2016-17 season as a top candidate to win the MVP race. The face of the franchise, Tim Duncan, had announced his retirement the summer leading up to the season, thrusting Leonard into the forefront of Spurs basketball </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an organization synonymous with class and poise. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The season culminated with a Western Conference matchup against the Golden State Warriors, after dominating the Grizzlies and the Rockets 4-2 each. The fateful Game 1 in Oracle haunts Spurs fans to this very day. With a commanding 23-point lead in the third quarter, Leonard went up for a shot to add to his 26 points </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">only to have Warriors center Zaza Pachulia make a dirty closeout leading to Leonard leaving the game. The 23-point lead the Spurs had built up to this point disintegrated and the Spurs would go on to get swept 4-0, with Leonard unable to play the rest of the series.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, the plan was for Leonard to make his return after the preseason. However, his debut in the 2017-18 season was repeatedly pushed back until Dec. 12. He went on to play nine games that entire season, citing continued pain in his quadricep as preventing his return. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, here’s where everything takes a turn. Leonard was diagnosed with a quadriceps tendinopathy by the Spurs’ medicalstaff. Tendinopathy is essentially a catch-all term for any issue with a tendon from soreness to a tear to a degenerative disease. Leonard had been cleared for play repeatedly throughout the season by the Spurs’ medical team. However, due to lingering pain, he elected to get a second opinion and was then diagnosed with a quadriceps contusion, which is internal bleeding of the muscle susceptible to calcification. Leonards refusal to play despite being cleared by the team’s medical staff in favor of a second outside opinion caused tensions to arise within the organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coaches and players started putting pressure on Leonard through the media, and the basketball world sided with them. At the time, very little to almost no information was known to the public. It is still unknown what the final diagnosis on the injury is to this day. In light of the lack of information, the media and fans sided with the Spurs, which had been a model of how a top-class organization should be run from top to bottom for almost 30 years until this point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leonard was vilified and ridiculed by the basketball world. Prominent media members like Skip Bayless accused Leonard of crumbling under the expectations of filling Tim Duncan’s shoes, while others began to question his character as a person altogether. A very clear divide had formed </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one where it was Leonard versus the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unable to rebuild trust with the Spurs organization and fans, Leonard requested a trade. Leonard had two years under contract left and had expressed explicit interest in going to LA to continue to grow his brand and career. Knowing this, very few teams were willing to part with assets that matched the talents of a player as decorated as Leonard. I mean, a two-time defensive player of the year and Finals MVP doesn’t just come every draft </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they’re once-in-a-generation type players, but only getting such a player for one guaranteed year turned many teams away from making a deal with the Spurs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toronto Raptors General Manager (GM) Masai Ujiri is not your regular GM however and despite knowing all that he knew, he took a wild gamble. The Raptors had lost to LeBron for four straight years, even though they built their team to match up specifically against the Cavaliers. After yet another upsetting elimination at the hands of James, Ujiri pulled the trigger to trade their franchise star DeMar DeRozan and roleplayer Jakob Poeltl for Leonard and Danny Green. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toronto was ridiculed for taking such a gamble </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">giving up a young All-Star in return for a superstar who had played nine games the prior season due to injury and was set on moving to LA in the near future. Nonetheless Ujiri made the controversial move, which has paid off greatly this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Raptors effectively locked down the second seed, not just in the East but the NBA as a whole behind Milwaukee. After making quick work of the Orlando Magic in 5, the Raptors faced the 76ers who were widely thought to have the best starting five after the Wariors. This series went to Game 7, and with the game on the line, Leonard ripped the hearts out of every Philly fan by hitting a series-ending game winner over Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toronto found themselves matched up with the best team in the NBA: the Bucks. After going down 0-2, Toronto rallied behind Leonard  to pull out a win in double overtime. Toronto went on to win four straight after losing the first two games to get to where they are today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leonard has come a long way from his initial fall from grace, and now stands on the verge of carrying the torch of best player in the world in the post-LeBron era to come in a few years. Now, he is less than seven games away from redefining not just his career but the NBA balance of power as a whole with the crucial 2019 free agency looming. But for now, NBA fans are all anticipating the redo of the matchup stolen from us by that injury two years ago.  </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88839\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/nba-finals-preview-kawhi-leonards-journey/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88839\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/nba-finals-preview-kawhi-leonards-journey/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/nba-finals-preview-kawhi-leonards-journey/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/nba-finals-preview-kawhi-leonards-journey/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/nba-finals-preview-kawhi-leonards-journey/","id":1151,"author":{"id":23,"name":"Nithesh Perumal"},"related":[1150,1149,1148],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":23,"name":"Nithesh Perumal","biography":"Not available","articles":[47,1151,1159,4861,4864,4883,5588,5594],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Swept by UCR, Unable to Preserve Leads","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite its 3-0 start to its Big West schedule last weekend, the UCSB softball team was swept in its visit to Riverside and is now 3-3 in conference games.

She struck out three and shut down a Gaucho lineup which dominated in their last series against Cal Poly. Gaucho catcher Samantha Stark was the lone bright spot for Santa Barbara as she had 3 hits on the day.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos did see some hope when they rallied to load the bases with two outs in the fourth inning. With freshman infielder Sierra Altmeyer, junior infielder Emily Brucelas, and freshman infielder Melanie Menor all on base, Ashley Wright stepped up to the  plate hoping to deliver a key hit.</p>\n<p>However, Misfeldt forced Wright into a groundout to end the rally. The Gauchos also rallied in the fifth by putting two runners on with one out, but Misfeldt again left them stranded.</p>\n<p>UCSB starting pitcher Ashley Ludlow pitched six innings, and took the loss. She allowed three earned runs and 12 hits in the game. Ludlow got in trouble in the first inning, after back-to-back RBI hits led to an early two-run lead for the Highlanders. UCR continued its attack, scoring again in the fourth and sixth innings.<br>\nIn the second game on Saturday afternoon, the Gauchos hitting came alive as they dominated the first three innings of the game and took an early a 6-0 lead. However, the Gauchos would soon see it all fall apart as the Highlanders rallied for five runs in the final two innings to beat the Gauchos 7-6 in a heartbreaking defeat.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos banged out eight hits in the game, registering two RBI’s each from Kristen Clark and Samantha Stark. Melanie Menor and outfielder Jessica Tetzlaft also had RBI’s.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders had 14 hits on the day led by second baseman Haley Harris who went  2-3 on the day with three RBI’s and a run scored. UCR right fielder Madeline Richard also went 3-4 with a run scored and a stolen base.</p>\n<p>Gaucho freshman starter Veronika Gulvin endured her ninth loss of the year, giving up seven runs and 14 hits in six innings of work.</p>\n<p>Riverside starter Anessa Cepeda pitched 6.2 innings, giving up six runs on eight hits while striking out two batters and walking five. Starter Tayler Misfeldt came on in relief to get the final out of the game to pick up her 16th win of the season.</p>\n<p>In Sunday’s game, the Gauchos again suffered a defeat at the hands of the Highlanders who completed the sweep with an eight inning 4-3 victory over UCSB.</p>\n<p>The game got off to a rocky start for the Gauchos as starting pitcher Veronika Gulvin gave up two earned runs in the first inning on a two-run homer by Highlander first baseman Natalie Sanchez.</p>\n<p>Ashley Ludlow then came on with only one out in the first to take over for the remainder of the game. Ludlow pitched brilliantly and took a 3-2 lead into the seventh until the Gauchos’ defense committed an error allowing the tying run to score.</p>\n<p>The game went into extra innings, but would end in Santa Barbara’s demise in the bottom of the eighth as UCSB’s defense completely collapsed. The Gauchos committed three more errors and allowed the winning run to score, handing the Highlanders the game and the series sweep.<br>\nHighlander starter Tayler Misfeldt pitched all eight innings for UCR, giving up three earned runs, one in each of the fourth, fifth and seventh innings. She gave up eight hits and struck out four in winning her 17th game of the year. Misfeldt claimed all three wins for the Highlanders in the series.</p>\n<p>UCSB will remain on the road for its next series as it will face Cal State Northridge beginning on Saturday.</p><div

However, as the old sports adage goes, it’s defense that wins championships and one Warriors player especially stands out in this field.</p>\n<p>Draymond Green’s legacy doesn’t only end at three-time NBA Champion, three-time NBA All-Defensive First Team and the 2017 NBA Defensive Player of the Year — but it does give you a good idea of his elite repertoire.</p>\n<p>Green is known around the league for his fiery passion and explosive play on the court, especially as of late when considering his recent string of performances in this year’s playoffs. Notably so, he’ll be entering the Finals series in fine form as he’s coming off a spectacular Western Conference Championship performance against the Portland Trailblazers, where he tallied 16.5 points per game, almost nine assists and 12 rebounds.</p>\n<p>This ability to show that he can produce on both ends of the court makes Green a significant X-Factor that the Toronto Raptors must take into account. Not to mention, he may have a good shot at Finals MVP — that is, if the next X-Factor doesn’t suit up in time for this series.    <strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Durant</strong></p>\n<p>As the current all-around best player in the league, Kevin Durant is someone who needs very little introduction. Still, his status for the NBA Finals may be in question as he’s been dealing with an apparent hamstring injury that’s kept him sidelined since the second-round series against the Houston Rockets; Golden State has already confirmed he will not be ready in time for game one in Toronto.</p>\n<p>At first, the media expected Durant’s injury to be much worse than it turned out to be, with diagnoses like an ACL tear being projected. However, recent reports have brought concern down to merely a hamstring injury which offers him a chance to return to action for the Warriors very soon.</p>\n<p>But this only begs the question of if his return may in fact hinder Golden State’s chances considering the team is 31-1 in their last 32 games with Curry and without Durant. Still, Durant’s presence should without a doubt bolster his side’s attack and offer another set of clutch hands if a win is on the line in the late-game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Regardless, these X-Factors’ potential storylines will make this 2019 NBA Finals one of the most highly anticipated championships in recent memory and will surely give basketball fans everywhere a spectacular show.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Toronto Raptors just made the NBA Finals for the first time in their franchise’s history. This is fantastic for Raptor fans; however, they are going to have to beat the Golden State Warriors, the team competing in their fifth straight finals. Does Toronto have any chance of dethroning this star-studded superteam? Obviously guys like Kawhi Leonard and Steph Curry will have crucial roles in the outcome of this series, but for the Raptors, who else is going to step up to stop the Warriors? This best of seven will most likely come down to a few key players taking their game to that next level, on the NBA’s biggest stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first potential X-Factor of this series is Kyle Lowry. The 12th year veteran out of Villanova took a lot of scrutiny early in these playoffs for his Game 1 performance versus the Orlando Magic. Since that game, he has been playing extremely efficient, averaging 14.7 points per game and with a 45% shooting percentage. Along with his scoring, Lowry has been facilitating the Raptors’ offense, averaging 6.4 assists per contest. Coming into this Finals, Lowry will face his toughest challenge yet, defending Steph Curry. Although the Warriors can score in a variety of ways, their offense is at its best when Curry is playing well. If Lowry can pester and harass Curry to force him out of the groove, then the Raptors could have a legitimate chance.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toronto’s next potential game changer in this series, is Fred VanVleet. Since the birth of his second child on May 20, VanVleet has been shooting the lights out. In the 15 playoff games prior to his sons arrival, VanVleet was not turning heads, only averaging four points per game and hitting just 19.5% of three-point attempts. Since May 20, VanVleet has broken out, now averaging 16 points per game and has nailed 82.4% of three-point attempts. If Fred VanVleet can continue this hot shooting streak, the Raptors’ chances improve dramatically in this series. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another key component to Toronto’s success is found within Pascal Siakam. Having to most likely matchup with Warriors forward, Kevin Durant, Siakam is going to have to be extremely active on the defensive end of the floor. Luckily for him, Siakam is 6’9’’, with a 7’3’’ wingspan and moves like a guard. Hopefully he can put all of his length and quickness to work when trying to contain Kevin Durant. In these playoffs, Siakam has been scoring very profficently, averaging 18.7 points per game on 45% shooting. The Raptors will need Siakam to continue to produce for them on both ends of the floor if they want any shot at winning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some athletes often think that seasons are won or lost based off of certain players within the team. This isn’t the case in the NBA Finals. Championship series are never won by one single player. Every year, the NBA Finals is won by the best team. With that, if the Toronto Raptors want any chance of hoisting the Larry O’Brien Trophy, it is going to take an overall collective effort. The starters all the way to the last guy on the bench are going to have to step up to put a stop to the Warriors’ reign. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88829\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/nba-finals-preview-the-x-factors/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88829\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/nba-finals-preview-the-x-factors/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/nba-finals-preview-the-x-factors/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/nba-finals-preview-the-x-factors/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/nba-finals-preview-the-x-factors/","id":1149,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1148,1147,1146],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Eager To Get Back On The Field","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160402-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160402-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos hope to recover from their three game losing streak and get back to the top of the Big West standings when it takes on conference opponent CSUN.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">After getting swept in last weekend’s three game series against UC Riverside, the UCSB softball team will look to make improvements in this weekend’s match-up against CSU Northridge.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69821\" style=\"width: 183px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69821\" data-attachment-id=\"69821\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-14/ucsb-eager-to-get-back-on-the-field/softball_vscalpoly-20160402-dustinharris-1-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160402-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?fit=800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Softball_vsCalPoly-20160402-DustinHarris-1-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160402-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160402-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-69821\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160402-DustinHarris-1-web.jpg?resize=173%2C260\" alt=\"Jaqueline Hinojosa starts sprinting to first base after hitting the ball.
