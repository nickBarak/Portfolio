After discovering that the initial plan for the project did not include any new bike parking, the A.S. Bike Committee began advocating for the addition of bike parking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annie Golay, chair of the A.S. bike committee, wrote a letter to the SRB Governance Board in Spring Quarter 2018, offering a compromise design that included 35 new bike spaces directly in front of the SRB. The governance board then agreed to the 35 new bike spaces in an updated design. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While we would have liked to have gotten more, we felt like the 35 was a good compromise between having bike parking for students and having [bike parking] available in the safest way possible, in addition to meeting their needs for programming as well,” Golay said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The original design plan included renovations of five major areas, which includes the lawn directly in front of the SRB, empty space in front of Parking Lot 22 and the bike path which runs between these two areas. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the SRB Governance Board was notified by the Campus Planning Committee within the UCSB Office of Budget and Planning at the end of 2018 that the scope of their design was not possible, according to Velasco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We found out that the school has future plans for pretty much 80% of the area we wanted to renovate, so now we’re only renovating a very small portion of land that’s right in front of the SRB,” Velasco said. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88071\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88071\" data-attachment-id=\"88071\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-09/bike-committee-opposition-does-not-change-srb-design-plans/ucsb-srb-north-gathering-space_conceptplan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?fit=250%2C162&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?fit=888%2C575&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-88071 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?resize=888%2C575\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"575\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?resize=250%2C162&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?resize=768%2C497&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C663&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&amp;ssl=1 355w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UCSB-SRB-North-Gathering-Space_ConceptPlan_2018_05-30-estimate-area-diagram-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88071\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The SRB North Landscaping Design Project design from May 2018. Only Area 4 is part of the current design.<em> Courtesy of Annie Golay and Ricardo Uribe</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the project was minimized, new bike parking was removed altogether. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We knew we needed to act fast because we felt that bike parking is a huge problem on campus and our job as a committee is to make sure we have appropriate infrastructure and bike parking available for students, because bike parking is such a vital part of our campus,” Golay said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A.S. Bike Committee wrote a second letter to the SRB Governance Board on March 1, spoke to board members at multiple meetings and helped draft the A.S. Senate resolution that passed last week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ricardo Uribe serves as both a Letters and Science Senator as well as a board representative for the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity. He believes that the student support from the resolution did not change the outcome of current design plans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Obviously that resolution shows that there was some sort of need for this space … I think that the resolution didn’t have an effect that it attended to,” Uribe said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At last Friday’s SRB Governance Board meeting, three different propositions for the design project were presented: either add bike parking, wait until other future projects planned by the university for the area were completed or move forward with the SRB Design plan without bike parking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board voted 11-2 to move forward without bike parking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two board members who voted in favor of bike parking are both affiliated with A.S.: Alexis Xa, the A.S. representative on the SRB Governance Board, and Uribe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Golay, who spoke at Friday’s governance board meeting, believes the current amount of bicycle parking is insufficient and causes a safety threat to students going to the SRB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because students have to pass all these bike lanes to get to the SRB, it is really dangerous, and that lot is already over-subscribed,” Golay said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We think the safest and best option is to include at least a few bike parking spaces at the SRB, because currently none exist, and we’re concerned about the safety and needs of students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main priority of the SRB Governance Board, according to Velasco, was to begin work as soon as possible on the SRB North Landscape Design Project. If bike parking was added, a new redesign would be required, pushing the project back by another year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On June 7, the SRB Governance Board will vote to approve the final cost of $560,000 for the project. If this measure passes, construction will begin in summer 2019.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Not for him and not for his critics. The big question that remains is how the loss will reflect upon Manning’s legacy.</p>\n<p>There is no denying that Manning is unquestionably one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever suit up in the NFL. But in this league, and in sports in general, a player’s greatness is evaluated by how many rings he has.</p>\n<p>However, what separates Manning from the rest is that he didn’t need to win to solidify his legacy. Countless broken records and one Super Bowl title is already enough for Manning to claim his place among the greatest who ever played the game.</p>\n<p>Ask yourself this, would you place Eli Manning, who has two Super Bowl titles, ahead of big brother Peyton?</p>\n<p>Although the Broncos might have lost in a humiliating fashion that no one saw coming, how much can that actually change what Manning has accomplished over his career? Not much. He has achieved what no other quarterback has done during his era has, and that is something worth noting in a pass-happy league.</p>\n<p>The knock on Manning will remain that he is the greatest regular season quarterback ever. But think about it, how many players can lead a team to the best record for two-straight years after coming off a career-threatening neck injury? That alone should give you some insight into Manning’s greatness, and he did it at 37 years of age.</p>\n<p>Looking back at the game, it wasn’t all Manning’s fault. It’s easy to point fingers at only the quarterback and the coach in football. Yet, a quarterback is only as good as the supporting cast around him, and that supporting cast that showed up for the first 18 games of the season was nowhere to be found in the last game of the year.</p>\n<p>No one could have predicted that the first play of the game would result in a botched snap going over the head of Manning and turning into a safety. Manning sure didn’t.</p>\n<p>The explosive wide receiver core of Demaryius Thomas and Eric Decker trembled and looked flustered by the Legion of Boom, and the offensive line did little to help Manning throw his signature passes.</p>\n<p>The Broncos defense wasn’t much help either. Seattle hadn’t been putting up points in its run-up to the Super Bowl, yet the Broncos’ defense gave up two touchdowns through the air, one on the ground, one on a kick return and had a bunch of missed tackles.</p>\n<p>The Broncos were outplayed by a defense that was built to counter its record-setting offense. It’s as simple as that. The better team won and it showed throughout the game.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this wasn’t the storybook ending Peyton Manning and fans had hoped for. Numerous people dreamed of Peyton going out on top just like John Elway did after he lost his first three Super Bowls for Denver.</p>\n<p>The Broncos are still a young, talented team with much to improve on and under the leadership of Elway, the Broncos will still be a contender. For Peyton, at least he knows there’s someone in the organization who knows how he feels right about now and will give him the tools to get back.</p>\n<p>So, is Peyton one of the greatest to play? Yes. Is he the greatest of all-time? Not right now, but there’s always next season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of Feb. 5th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53867\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53867\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies-2/","id":2059,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[2058,2057,2056],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Super Bowl XLVIII: One Game,  Plenty of New Legacies","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/football.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/football.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Pete Carroll is the Best Coach in the West","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Pete Carroll isn’t just in the championship business.

Before the reign of the SEC in college football, Carroll’s Trojans were the dominant program in the entire nation.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But the word on Carroll in previous years was that he was a college coach, and a college coach only. Before he went to Southern California, Carroll had unsuccessful tenures with the New York Jets and New England Patriots. A late season slide resulted in a 6-10 record with the Jets in 1994, leading to his firing after one season.</p>\n<p>Because of his success as a defensive backs coach and a defensive coordinator, he was given the chance to follow Bill Parcells in New England. The Patriots made the playoffs in Carroll’s first two seasons, but Carroll was again fired after a late season slide in 1999.</p>\n<p>Carroll had gained a reputation as a lame duck NFL head coach, but created a new legacy as an all-world recruiter and young spirit with his time at USC. He is the epitome of a player’s coach, and it translated to success in the NFL with this young Seahawks team. It’s not every day where a 62-year-old head coach connects with his players as equals, participating in full-contact drills one day and leading meditative yoga sessions the next.</p>\n<p>Carroll encourages his players to be themselves, on-and-off the field, which is part of the reason the attitude and sometimes overzealous confidence of the Legion of Boom is tolerated by fans in Seattle. Also, a Super Bowl ring helps.</p>\n<p>After becoming only the third coach in history to win a Super Bowl and a National Championship, Pete Carroll has established himself as one of the all-time greats, not just in college football. He is far and away the best football coach in the western United States (all due respect to Jim Harbaugh, but Pete has the hardware), and deserves to be included with names like Bill Belichick and Nick Saban in the conversation of best coach in America.</p>\n<p>There is also the strong possibility that we might be witnessing the next NFL dynasty evolving before our very eyes. Seattle has a 25-year-old franchise quarterback who has had more winning success in his first two years than any player in history, lethal weapons on offense in Marshawn Lynch and Percy Harvin, the best secondary in the last 20 years with all three of their all-world players returning, salary cap flexibility once they get rid of some overpriced inessential players and the best home-field advantage outside of Kansas City.</p>\n<p>A winning culture has been restored in Seattle, and Pete Carroll is leading the way. He was voted most popular coach in the league by players, and with his emphasis on relentless competition, no matter the situation, the loaded NFC can count on the road to the Super Bowl going through the 12th man.</p>\n<p>One would think Carroll has earned some rest and relaxation after such an epic journey. He’s having none of that though. The Seahawks victory parade is scheduled for Wednesday. Meetings to begin the 2014 season occurred yesterday. A champion’s work is never done. Always compete.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of Feb. 5th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53864\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53864\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/super-bowl-xlviii-one-game-plenty-of-new-legacies/","id":2058,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[2057,2056,2055],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
