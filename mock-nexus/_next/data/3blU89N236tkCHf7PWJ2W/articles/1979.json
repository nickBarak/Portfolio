It’s a great way to get involved on campus.”</p>\n<p>“We just want to make this a really good, fun program,” Jauch said.</p>\n<p>In its first appearance at the NCA Nationals, Santa Barbara’s cheer team participated in the Intermediate Small Coed I category of the Challenge Cup competition.</p>\n<p>The only California based university within the competitive category, UCSB managed to finish in sixth-place with a final score of 76.48 points in Day Two of the Nationals.</p>\n<p>Able to place two standings above last place, an enticing future seems to be ahead for UCSB’s cheer team as this past weekend was the first step in its progression.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69735\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-cheer-focused-on-growth-participates-in-nca-nationals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69735\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-cheer-focused-on-growth-participates-in-nca-nationals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-cheer-focused-on-growth-participates-in-nca-nationals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-cheer-focused-on-growth-participates-in-nca-nationals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-cheer-focused-on-growth-participates-in-nca-nationals/","id":1978,"author":{"id":319,"name":"Madeline Ewer"},"related":[1977,1976,1975],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“She doesn’t know that she’s a sea lion and she doesn’t know where she is”: Unhealthy Sea Lion Spotted on I.V.

Once the volunteer arrived to the beach a few hours later, he confirmed to Rogers that the sea lion was suffering from domoic acid toxicosis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Domoic acid toxicosis starts at the bottom of the food chain, found among the phytoplankton called pseudo-nitzschia. Through biomagnification, the toxicity of this harmful algal bloom — a rapid growth of algae in a small area — becomes more concentrated in animals as it goes from krill to small fish and sardines to the California sea lion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The volunteer] was describing to me how it literally shrinks the size of the sea lion hippocampi … and for the rest of the hour I just listened to him off the edge of my seat with my mouth hanging open,” Rogers explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The way he was describing [the sea lion’s] mental state, he equated it to human dementia and was telling me she doesn’t know that she’s a sea lion and she doesn’t know where she is. She doesn’t know that she needs to hunt, she doesn’t know what fish are.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When CIMWI gets a call about domoic acid toxicosis in animals, a volunteer arrives at the scene to assess the animal, but they usually keep the animal in its immediate surroundings instead of relocating to the rehabilitation facility in order prevent further disorientation. The sea lion is left “in a safety perimeter” and volunteers regularly monitor the animal’s condition, according to signs CIMWI posted along I.V. beaches over the weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While domoic acid toxicosis seriously impacts the affected sea lion’s health, acute effects dissipate after 72 hours as the toxin works its way through the animal’s body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The effects of domoic acid go beyond sea lion health on the Central Coast. Mussels and other shellfish feed on pseudo-nitzschia, which is potentially deadly to humans if they eat affected mussels. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we were to say, eat mussels that have been filtering and feeding on pseudo-nitzschia that happen to be toxic … we would pick up those toxins as well,” said Mark Brzezinski, professor of biological oceanography and director of the Marine Science Institute. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s why when domoic acid levels are high, the shellfish harvesting is put on hold, because those could be poisonous.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While studies clearly indicate a rise in domoic acid due to climate and human-generated issues, there’s not a simple connection between a changing atmosphere and preventing outbreaks of domoic acid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Brzezinski explained, the pseudo-nitzschia phytoplankton does not always produce the toxin, so researchers find it nearly impossible to predict when and where algal blooms will be toxic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because it’s in the water doesn’t mean it’s producing the toxin </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that’s one of the frustrating things. We monitor the amounts of pseudo-nitzschia in the water every week; we take a sample on Monday, and by Tuesday we have the answer. But we also know that the relationship between the number of pseudo-nitzschia out there and toxicity is really poor. The numbers don’t predict toxicity. We can’t infer the toxic bloom just from the number of organisms out there, which is a little frustrating, but we have to be careful interpreting abundance data.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Essentially, the same species can be toxic one day and not the other. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not known in a well enough way that, ‘This group’s going to be toxic and that group over there’s not.’ We’re not at that point. It’s one of the areas that people who do this full time are really focused in on, to try and understand that, because it’s a major gap in our knowledge.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With any future sea lion sightings, CIMWI warns beachgoers to keep their distance even if the sea lion appears approachable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But from what Rogers witnessed on the beach, it will take a lot of diligence for students to keep their space from rare close encounters with marine wildlife.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that we live in a very voyeuristic society, particularly with the rise of like heavy documentation of our lives and the things we see. I’d be remiss to say it wasn’t connected to social media,” Rogers said. “But I also do think there’s a kind of benign interest in natural phenomenon, like with a growing disconnect between us and the environment and I think that people are interested in kind of bridging that gap for themselves.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rogers waited hours by the sea lion for CIMWI, telling students to keep their space. For her, the change from her daily routine was a reminder for her to remain active in the fight against climate change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had a moment of reckoning where I was on my second hour of waiting for CIMWI and I was kind of like, ‘Okay, this is taking a long time, I’m dedicating a lot of time to this.’ I was questioning myself, does my emotional response to these kinds of things hinder me or is it a strength? Because I was feeling very drained by the fact that I was watching the sea lion and I didn’t know her fate and I was having this reckoning with myself.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just hope that students hear this call-to-arms and remain helpful in order to be productive and when they feel this emotional hole to notice and bear witness to what’s happening in the environment. I hope that students follow the path of action rather than the path of denial and paralyzation and don’t let themselves be overwhelmed by what’s happening, but instead let themselves be motivated and kind of be sparked to action and to making change.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Used as a reference for the 1980 USA hockey team’s miracle on ice or Doug Flutie’s hail-mary miracle in 1984, these events refer to favorable situations that competitors themselves did not even fathom. Northern Iowa’s game winner against Texas serves as a prime example of this.</p>\n<p>One of many upsets that occurred this year, the Cinderella sleeper of Northern Iowa took on sixth seeded University of Texas in the first round of the 2016 NCAA Tournament. The Panthers, winners of the Missouri Valley Conference and hosting an overall record of 23-12, had been in this position before.</p>\n<p>Growing accustomed to the role of a season spoiler as a testament to their postseason knockoff in 2010 of 1<sup>st</sup> ranked Kansas Jayhawks, this griddy squad saw the challenge of containing All-Big 12 players Isaiah Taylor and Javan Felix, and Prince Ibeh as an nonchalant task.</p>\n<p>Jeremy Morgan helped the Panthers get out to a 44-36 advantage at the break scoring 12 points and going 4-5 from the field. Rising up for a crucial block in at the 18<sup>th</sup> minute on the 6-11 Ibeh, this statement play let their opponents know they were ready to play.</p>\n<p>Clawing back from as any as 16, however, Texas guard Isaiah Taylor stopped on the right block and floated in a teardrop that knotted up the score, 72-72 in the final minute.</p>\n<p>With 2.7 seconds to go, a miracle shot was wishful thinking for Northern Iowa Head Coach Ben Jacobson and his team.</p>\n<p>Panther forward Paul Jespersen meets the ball at half court. Pivoting towards the middle of the floor, the senior took two dribbles to maneuver past his Longhorn defender and chucked up a half court prayer. With the orange ball suspended in the air, Jespersen banks the shot in. Madness erupts in the Chesapeake Arena. An upset has just been added to this year’s bracket on a remarkable play.</p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li><strong>No. 10 Gonzaga vs. No. 2 Stanford (1999) Final Score: 82-74</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<div id=\"attachment_69716\" style=\"width: 312px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69716\" data-attachment-id=\"69716\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-10/nexus-top-10-most-memorable-march-madness-upsets/zags/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zags.png?fit=1170%2C772&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1170,772\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"zags\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zags.png?fit=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zags.png?fit=888%2C586&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-69716\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zags.png?resize=302%2C199\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of Spokesman.com\" width=\"302\" height=\"199\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zags.png?w=1170&amp;ssl=1 1170w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zags.png?resize=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zags.png?resize=768%2C507&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zags.png?resize=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zags.png?resize=980%2C647&amp;ssl=1 980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 302px) 100vw, 302px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69716\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of Spokesman.com</p></div>\n<p>A West coast rivalry emerged in the second round of 1999 NCAA Tournament. Tenth-seeded Gonzaga University took on the Pac-10 elite Stanford Cardinal.</p>\n<p>A team stacked with tournament experience from the previous year and led by All-American forward Mark Madsen, grinding past a younger inexperienced Bulldog crew was the last thing on Stanford’s mind. Second-year coach Head Coach Dan Monson and his young Spokane team quickly grabbed the Cardinal’s attention however.</p>\n<p>Playing in their own backyard, Gonzaga utilized this home-court advantage at the Seattle Center Coliseum to crush Stanford’s hopes of a tournament title.</p>\n<p>Matt Santangelo, the protégé to former Bulldog John Stockon, led by example for his team. Scoring 22 points, 14 of which were in the second half, the All-WCC point guard took control in all facets racking up six rebounds and six assists.</p>\n<p>The Bulldog’s hustle and drive proved to be the decisive factor in propelling them to victory. Gonzaga outrebounded Stanford 47-33 on the glass and used a late 20-10 swing in the second half to seal their fate with a 74-82 upset. Monson and his team continued their Cinderella run that year clinching its first ever Elite Eight appearance with a 73-72 win in the Sweet Sixteen against No. 6 Florida.</p>\n<p>While falling to the winners of the tournament, the Uconn Huskies, this historic run by Gonzaga put their school on the map and proved to the world they were a scrappy West Coast Conference program could compete against the best.</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><strong><strong>No. 14 Georgia State vs. No. 3 Baylor (2015) Final Score: 57-56</strong></strong>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_69717\" style=\"width: 309px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69717\" data-attachment-id=\"69717\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-10/nexus-top-10-most-memorable-march-madness-upsets/gsu/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gsu.png?fit=1280%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"gsu\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gsu.png?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gsu.png?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-69717\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gsu.png?resize=299%2C168\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of Collegehoops.com\" width=\"299\" height=\"168\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gsu.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gsu.png?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gsu.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gsu.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69717\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of Collegehoops.com</p></div></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Nothing can replicate the bond of a father and son, just ask Georgia State Head Coach Ron Hunter and R.J Hunter. As a three-year point guard under the Panthers, this similar passion is what kept the two connected. In what could have been his final game under his father’s wing, R.J. Hunter gave his dad the most prized gift he could ask for: a first round victory in the 2015 NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Trailing by 12 against third seed Baylor, this opening round match was shaping up to be an early exit for the team from Georgia. But the struggling Hunter never gave up.</p>\n<p>After a dismal 3-point performance in the first half, the Sun Belt Player of the Year commanded one of the most memorable last minute drives in tournament history. Scoring nine points in the final two minutes, Hunter sliced the lead and pulled his Panthers within two, 56-54.</p>\n<p>After a series of defensive stops and a missed one-and-one from Baylor’s Kenny Cherry, the Panthers handed the ball back to the player that got them to this moment. With just under ten seconds on the game clock and his father watching afar, Hunter called for the ball. The guard created some separation off a dribble exchange and pulled up from 35 feet.</p>\n<p>Hitting nothing but net, Ron Hunter fell to the floor in disbelief. As his head coach and father, a feeling of admiration filled Hunter for his son’s gusty shot.</p>\n<p>To the Georgia State duo and the rest of viewers that were watching, this last second upset stood as a sentimental moment between father and son.</p>\n<p>This was an emotional win for Georgia State’s Kevin Ware as well. The same tournament that halted his career with a gruesome leg injury, the former Louisville Cardinal worked his way back to recovery and made his return back on the hardwood this time in a Panther uniform.

McCollum has rightfully earned his starting role for the Portland Trailblazers, the Canton, Ohio native does not forget the path that brought him there. An undersized shooting guard out of Lehigh University, McCollum understood that advancing to the next level meant earning your stripes. Guiding the Mountain Hawks in 2012 to an opening round match against No. 2 Duke in the NCAA Tournament, McCollum would not allow the Blue Devils’ prestige to halt him from chasing his dream.</p>\n<p>Entering the tourney on an eight-game win streak, No. 15 Lehigh had an undeniable chip on it shoulder. The Mountain Hawks were ready to take on an ACC heavyweight in Duke and it started in the backcourt with McCollum. Matched up against All-ACC freshman Austin Rivers and junior guard Seth Curry, McCollum made sure his name was known by the end of the game. Outshooting the Blue Devil pair with a game-high 30 points to their 26, the no-name guard meant business.</p>\n<p>Building on McCollum’s crucial three at the 2:26 mark, the junior dished an assist to teammate Jordan Hamilton in the final minute for a go-ahead slam. With 23 seconds to spare and a 69-64 Mountain Hawk advantage, it was at that point McCollum and his team could taste victory.</p>\n<p>The Mountain Hawks clinched two milestones that day being the first time in program history they defeated Duke and advanced to the round of 32.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>No. 15 Middle Tennessee vs. No. 2 Michigan State (2016) Final Score: 90-81</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<div id=\"attachment_69719\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69719\" data-attachment-id=\"69719\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-10/nexus-top-10-most-memorable-march-madness-upsets/mtsu/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mtsu.png?fit=630%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"630,420\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"mtsu\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mtsu.png?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mtsu.png?fit=630%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-69719\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mtsu.png?resize=300%2C200\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of Bleacherreport.com\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mtsu.png?w=630&amp;ssl=1 630w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mtsu.png?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69719\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of Bleacherreport.com</p></div>\n<p>The round of 64 is always one that is prominent with upsets, but in the case of second seed Michigan State, only the unwise would have been foolish enough to predict a first round exit for Hall of Fame Head Coach Tom Izzo and his Spartans.</p>\n<p>On paper, the East Lansing team was all you could ask for in March. Heading into the tournament on a nine-game win streak, a Final Four finalist in last year’s tournament, and equipped with presumably the player of the year in forward Denzel Valentine, this Big-10 powerhouse was not a team to be tampered with. But then emerged a team with nothing to lose in Middle Tennessee State.</p>\n<p>The Blue Raiders shocked the world in their 90-81 defeat of Michigan State. A match which the Conference USA team led the entire time, brackets were busted, seniors were devastated, and most importantly expectations had been crushed in this unimaginable victory.</p>\n<p>ESPN reported that out of 13.02 million brackets, 22.3 percent had the East Lansing team winning it all. This was an honorary stat Reggie Upshaw and his Blue Raiders hoped to annihilate. The forward kept his team on pace leading Middle Tennessee with 21 points.</p>\n<p>A strong outing defensively against Valentine also propelled Middle Tennessee to victory. A triple-double threat with an average of 19.2 points per game, Valentine was held to 5-13 shooting night for 13 points. Middle Tennessee’s defense proved to be too much for the Naismith candidate committing six turnovers in the game.</p>\n<p>What started as a promising season evolved into a bitter upset. Victims of last year’s final four defeat to Duke, the Spartans were ready to make another run in the tournament but came short.

Boasting an overall record of 30-5, furnished with the best starting five in conference, and finishing at the 3<sup>rd</sup> ranking in the AP Polls that year, there was no doubt that this well-crafted crew would give regular appearing squads such as Duke, UNC, and Kansas a run for their money.</p>\n<p>Earning a March Madness bid, this Midwest team had sure goals of their sixth ever Elite Eight appearance but underestimated the heart of hungry team and a relentless senior.</p>\n<p>Winners of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, Norfolk had never clinched a bid to the big dance. But just like many no-name teams, the Spartans did not take this opportunity for granted.

One of the most pivotal plays the current Knicks’ forward made was with 34 seconds remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>With the score tied at 81, the center fielded an air ball shot from teammate Chris McEahin. Soaring high, O’Quinn drew contact and converted the tip in giving his team some crucial momentum.</p>\n<p>Briskly turning towards his bench in an energized Omaha center, O’ Quinn and his Spartans knew this moment was theirs for the taking.</p>\n<p>The Tigers set up a play for senior leader Phil Pressey. Moving down the left wing, the guard put up a last second three that clanked off the iron. From there, another Cinderella story was birthed.</p>\n<p>Nobody believed that the Spartans would be able to win, nobody but themselves.

While the Golden State superstar continues to dazzle NBA fans with his majestic-like play, 2008 was a year overcoming odds and fighting for recognition.</p>\n<p>At 25.9 points per game, Davidson point guard Stephen Curry showed high promise to a handful of NBA scouts. Single-handedly leading his Wildcats to its third consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance, an opportunity emerged for the Charlotte native to splurge his talents on national television. The sophomore did not fail to impress.</p>\n<p>With two 30-point games in his first ever NCAA appearance and exterminating 24<sup>th</sup> ranked Gonzaga and eighth ranked Georgetown, critics were amazed by the ability this 6-3 sharpshooter possessed.</p>\n<p>Looking to extend the Wildcat’s win streak to 25 games that year, Davidson paired up against another heavyweight in sixth ranked Wisconsin. A disciplined team credited for their hardnosed guard play in Michael Flowers and Trevon Hughes, the Badgers’ defense could not dismantle Curry’s streaky and confident shooting from the floor.</p>\n<p>The third year player outscored Wisconsin by himself, 22-20, in the second half, assisting his team to its first Elite Eight in 39 years. This marked one of the best Cinderella runs by a Southern Conference team and player in March Madness history.</p>\n<p>With stars like Lebron James in attendance during this playoff intensified match, Curry’s March performance stood as a sure foreshadowing of what the NBA should expect.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>No. 13 NIU vs. No. 1 Kansas Jayhawks (2010): Final Score 69-67</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<div id=\"attachment_69722\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69722\" data-attachment-id=\"69722\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-10/nexus-top-10-most-memorable-march-madness-upsets/niu/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/niu.png?fit=641%2C488&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"641,488\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"niu\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/niu.png?fit=250%2C190&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/niu.png?fit=641%2C488&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-69722\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/niu.png?resize=300%2C228\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of Theplayerstribune.com\" width=\"300\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/niu.png?w=641&amp;ssl=1 641w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/niu.png?resize=250%2C190&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69722\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of Theplayerstribune.com</p></div>\n<p>It’s a rare occasion to see the Kansas Jayhawks basketball team down.

With only four losses on the year and a conference record of 17-1, there was no doubt the 1993 Arizona Wildcats had plans of hoisting the coveted NCAA championship trophy. Yet even the greatest teams have their fair share of defeats.</p>\n<p>For the second consecutive year, an first round loss concluded Head Coach Lute Olson and his Wildcats’ season.</p>\n<p>Santa Clara University, an inexperienced squad featuring first year Head Coach Dick Davey and dynamic freshman Steve Nash proved to be the root of this.</p>\n<p>A first year guard hailing from British Columbia, Nash held his own against noted NBA prospect and Arizona weapon Damon Stoudamire. Starting only his fourth game, Nash held the lefty floor general to one of his worst shooting performances ever with an 0-7 shooting night and a total of six points.</p>\n<p>The scrappy freshman did all the little things to keep the Wildcats at bay and put his Broncos in position to win.Nash scored eight of his ten points from behind the line, including six straight free throws in the last 30 seconds to ice the game.</p>\n<p>Pete Eisenrich’s game-high 19 points proved to be huge for Santa Clara . A baseline jumper gave Santa Clara the lead back with 2:49 remaining in the game. For the first team this season, the Wildcats were on their heels.</p>\n<p>With two defenders clinched on him, Stoudamire put up a Hail Mary heave from three to have his shot hit the back rim. Thus, the Cinderella of Santa Clara was born.

He draws up a play to milk the clock.  Senior guard Joey Rodriguez finds his way out of defensive trap and makes the biggest play of the night to Bradford Burgess for the backdoor lob. The Rams now have an eight-point cushion with 1:51 to go.</p>\n<p>A missed jumper from Kansas guard Brady Morningstar on the other end sends VCU fans to their feet. The Alamodome erupts.

A team who for sure should have taken the crown with NBA-bound stars like the Marcus and Markief Morris and Thomas Robinson?</p>\n<p>In this David versus Goliath matchup the VCU Rams prevailed, becoming just the third No. 11 seed in NCAA history to advance to the Final Four.

Despite a dominant regular season hosting eight weeks at the number one ranking, it was quickly overshadowed by one the most notable Cinderella teams in tournament history, the George Mason Patriots.</p>\n<p>A small Virginia team out of the Atlantic-10 conference, had fought all year for this moment. Overshadowed in previous years by other prominent programs in the area such as West Virginia, UVA, and Virginia Tech, the Patriots showed everyone it was their year to shine.</p>\n<p>Heading into the big dance with a 27-8 record, a major step from last years 16-13 season and grabbing key wins against Wichita State and 25<sup>th</sup> ranked James Madison George Mason found its mark as the 11 seed in the East. Defeating Michigan State, North Carolina, and Wichita State, first year Head Coach Jim Larranaga knew this matchup against UConn would be deemed as championship game for his team. So they played as if it was the championship.</p>\n<p>Sending this game into overtime, the Patriots performed with poise knocking down five of six shots in the additional five minutes, including a baseline fade away from Folarin Campbell to give the Patriots a hard fought 86-84 victory. For George Mason, this moment couldn’t have felt more surreal: its first ever trip to the Final Four and a knockoff of the team who was predicted to win it all.</p>\n<p>Despite a 20-point outing from the All-American Gay, a feeling of emptiness pierced through the forward capping off a 30-win season empty-handed. The game concluded with the George Mason band mash up of “Livin’ on a Prayer”. For coach Larranaga and his team, their prayer was surely answered that night.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69713\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-10/nexus-top-10-most-memorable-march-madness-upsets/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69713\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-10/nexus-top-10-most-memorable-march-madness-upsets/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-10/nexus-top-10-most-memorable-march-madness-upsets/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-10/nexus-top-10-most-memorable-march-madness-upsets/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-10/nexus-top-10-most-memorable-march-madness-upsets/","id":1976,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1975,1974,1973],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
