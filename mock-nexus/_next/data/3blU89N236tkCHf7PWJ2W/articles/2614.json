Upon arrival, deputies were flagged down by a nearby witness who stated the male subject, later identified as UCSB student Andres “Andy” Esteban Sanchez, had a deep laceration on his right arm. When deputies first made contact with Esteban Sanchez, he was being held down by three people. One deputy removed the blanket wrapped around Esteban Sanchez’s wound and revealed a cut approximately three-quarter inches in diameter around his arm. The deputy reapplied the blanket and attempted to restrain Esteban Sanchez. Medics arrived, secured Esteban Sanchez and transported him to SB Cottage Hospital.</p>\n<p>Esteban Sanchez’s roommate said he had seen the victim earlier in the evening when he rushed into their apartment talking gibberish. One of the reporting officers visited the address, where the subject had punched through a window and cut his arm on the glass.</p>\n<p>The deputy contacted SB Cottage Hospital and provided Esteban Sanchez’s personal information. Hospital staff advised Esteban Sanchez was in surgery and may not survive. At approximately 6:51 a.m., SB Cottage Hospital staff reported Esteban Sanchez had died as a result of blood loss. The Goleta Patrol Bureau is currently handling the coroner’s report.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article stated Sanchez passed away at approximately 6:58 a.m.; however, the time of his passing was closer to 6:51 a.m. according to IVFP]</p>\n<p><em>*This article will be updated as information becomes available</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Punjabi Studies Pashaura Singh presented the history of Sikhism through its social and religious evolution at the MultiCultural Center Wednesday as the first speaker of its Religious Literacy series.</p>\n<p>MCC Programmer Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said the MCC will be hosting the series to educate students on the basics of new faiths and perspectives.</p>\n<p>“The religious literary experience at UCSB’s MCC started as a result of some lock-in fees that we acquired, and now it’s this big thing,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “It’s very important in our programming every quarter to include the ‘AB’s of a faith or work on religious events to expand horizons rooted in issues that might come out of them that our students might feel connected to.”</p>\n<p>Mohsenian-Rahman said the series began with a lecture on Sikhism to break down negative stereotypes of the religion.</p>\n<p>“It was important for a lot of reasons … to kind of shatter stereotypes and misconceptions of the Sikh community in conjunction with the Muslim community in the United States, where there’s such a heightened Islamophobia targeted at Muslims and people who look like they’re Muslims,” Mohsenian- Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Singh began his talk by explaining the core values taught by the religion’s founder, Guru Nanak, who was described by Singh as “looking at the audience, always ready to have a conversation.”</p>\n<p>Singh said one of the most notable things Guru Nanak established is the concept of a free canteen within a Sikh religious building called a Langar.</p>\n<p>“It is a very powerful institution he created — when you share the food, your ideas … the dining place expands the ideas,” Singh said.</p>\n<p>Singh said Sikhism is evolving and effectively entering the mainstream.</p>\n<p>“Social media is revolutionary; all communities are changing. It’s not just the Sikhi,” Singh said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biopsychology major Jagdeep Kaur said he was taught the principles of Sikhism by his family.</p>\n<p>“Growing up, my parents taught me a lot of stuff about Sikhism. When I was younger I would go to Sunday school, and they would teach us a lot about Sikhism and the culture,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>Singh said many people, especially youth, find a connection to Sikhism because it teaches that “all human beings are equal.” Second-year communication and history of public policy double-major Jashleen Singh said she enjoys this aspect of Sikhism most.</p>\n<p>“He was talking about Langar and how everyone can go into the temple during lunch. Everyone eats together — it doesn’t matter whether you’re homeless,” Jashleen Singh said. “You don’t have to be Indian; you can be any other race and still come in. It’s a very accepting environment and a very accepting religion to have grown up with.”</p>\n<p>Attendee Emma Bobro said she came to the event to try to find a faith system she could believe in and discovered how fascinating Sikhism can be.</p>\n<p>“It’s beautiful, well, because it’s so basic. It seems more universal,” Bobro said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66456\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-13/professor-singh-speaks-on-sikhism-at-religious-literacy-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66456\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-13/professor-singh-speaks-on-sikhism-at-religious-literacy-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-13/professor-singh-speaks-on-sikhism-at-religious-literacy-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-13/professor-singh-speaks-on-sikhism-at-religious-literacy-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-13/professor-singh-speaks-on-sikhism-at-religious-literacy-series/","id":2612,"author":{"id":128,"name":"Siboney Arias"},"related":[2611,2610,2609],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate met Wednesday night in the Flying A Room of the UCen to finalize reforms to the Elections Code and wrap up the first quarter of the 2015-2016 school year.</p>\n<p>Members from several A.S. boards and commissions reported their end of quarter progress for the 2015-2016 school year.</p>\n<p>On-campus senator and second-year economics and political science double-major Nawar Nemeh presented “A Bill to Redefine Political Parties within ASUCSB,” which outlines the plan to regulate student misconduct within political parties through the A.S Judicial Council instead of being self-regulated.</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year political science major Stevan Abdalmalik presented “Resolution Denouncing S.A.G.E. [Student Advocacy, Governance and Engagement] without Referendum,” which would allow students to vote on UCSA fees through a system-wide referendum or to be able to opt out completely.</p>\n<p>“The end result for this would be a system-wide referendum where every school would be voting on the student fees that will be going to UCSA,” Abdalmalik said. “That way, UCSB students won’t be paying $10 while, say, UC Merced students pay $1.30 while getting the same exact benefits and same exact representation on the UCSA board.”</p>\n<p>Abdalmalik said although he supports S.A.G.E.’s intentions to standardize UCSA fees for all UC campuses, he does not support mandating the fees because it takes away student’s voices.</p>\n<p>“I believe that S.A.G.E. means well. However the fact that it takes away students’ rights and autonomy to actually vote on the student fees that they will be implemented on is wrong,” Abdalmalik said. “[The bill] denounces the fact that it doesn’t include referendum as its means of collecting the funding.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double-major Alejandra Melgoza presented “A Resolution for Andres Sanchez Investigation,” which demands for a more thorough investigation of Andres Sanchez’s death on Oct. 11.</p>\n<p>“It’s been past a month where an investigation has not been conducted,” Melgoza said. “The family still have many, many questions on what happened to Andres. No one knows.”</p>\n<p>According to Melgoza, witnesses and family collectively drafted a set of 50 questions they demand Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) and the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office answer. Melgoza said she is not satisfied with how IVFP and Community Resource Deputy (CRD) James McKarrell communicated with first responders and others involved with the incident.</p>\n<p>“We had a meeting with our Community Resources Deputy. If you were involved in the hiring of the CRD, his position was made for students and to involve the relationship of IVFP and us students,” Melgoza said. “When I, as a first responder, along with my housemates went to him for help, that help was not available. This was because one, his role was not set up, and two, he was just unable to answer our questions.”</p>\n<p>Student witness Jocelin Hernandez said rather than placing blame, the bill is intended to bring closure to the family and community.</p>\n<p>“We are not working for blaming. We are working for changing,” Hernandez said. “In terms of students and this university, we need to accept our privileges and that we can use these as tools.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez said after seeing findings of a recent coroner’s report, witnesses still have questions about the circumstances leading up to Sanchez’s death.</p>\n<p>“After a month of waiting for the Board of County, it looks like a toxicology report. It doesn’t matter how many drugs he might’ve been on because he was still a life that deserves to be treated to our ability,” Hernandez said.</p>\n<p>A motion to create a working group to reform election codes in order to regulate political parties year round passed.</p>\n<p>The reformed elections code passed in a hand vote, 12 to 3 to 4.</p>\n<p>“A Resolution in Support of Open Source Textbooks,” “Resolution Denouncing S.A.G.E. without Referendum” and “A Resolution for Andres Sanchez Investigation” also passed in a hand vote.</p>\n<p>“A Bill to Amend the By-Laws of the A.S. Queer Commission” was sent to Campus Affairs and “A Resolution to Establish an Ad-Hoc Committee o8n on the Establishment and Integration of the A.S.

No one knows.

Nyad unsuccessfully attempted the swim four times starting at age 28, with the 2013 swim being her fifth attempt in 35 years.</p>\n<p>Nyad said she thought of Cuba as “an untouchable star with a simply irresistible mystique” throughout her childhood, early swimming career and time as a professional sports journalist and commentator.</p>\n<p>Nyad said the most difficult part of her swim to Havana was nighttime, when she experienced “total sensory deprivation.”</p>\n<p>“That second night I had no idea who I was or what I was doing.” Nyad said. “I thought the blackness would never end.”</p>\n<p>Nyad said accomplishments should be viewed in terms of personal development.</p>\n<p>“When you achieve your dreams, it’s not so much about what you get but the person you become,” Nyad said. “I don’t succeed at everything I do, but I’m living this wild and precious life of mine full throttle.”</p>\n<p>UCSB alumna Kristina Hill, who just completed an open-water swim from the Channel Islands to Oxnard, attended Nyad’s talk Saturday. Hill said she admires Nyad and was excited to learn she would be in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“I’m just beginning to fall in love with this sport, and the fact that such an athletic and personal icon is here now in Santa Barbara is just awe-inspiring,” Hill said.</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Julie Keller said the talk was “extremely motivating,” but people do not necessarily need to set goals of the same scale as Nyad’s.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to note that these methods of extreme accomplishments and larger-than-life goal setting are certainly not for everyone,” Keller said.</p>\n<p>Lisa Noack, a parent of a UCSB student, said she read Nyad’s book and appreciates the idea of valuing one’s journey over the final destination.</p>\n<p>“We’re trained to get to the next level at every stage of our life and think that reaching that certain level will make us happy,” Noack said. “While brief moments of accomplishment are sweet, we forget about the deep value within the difficult, long process of accomplishing our goals. Diana truly relishes in the significance of her work while achieving what she wants.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66512\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/swimmer-speaks-on-novel-record-breaking-journey/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66512\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/swimmer-speaks-on-novel-record-breaking-journey/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/swimmer-speaks-on-novel-record-breaking-journey/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/swimmer-speaks-on-novel-record-breaking-journey/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/swimmer-speaks-on-novel-record-breaking-journey/","id":2613,"author":{"id":141,"name":"Ari Plachta"},"related":[2612,2611,2610],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
