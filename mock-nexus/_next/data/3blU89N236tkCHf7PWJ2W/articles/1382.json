The midfielder scored six goals for UCSB this year, good for second on the team, and earned a starting spot and leading role for years to come. Her goal total was the most tallied by a freshman within the program’s last two seasons.</p>\n<p>Schornstein and Ball were both selected to the All-Big West First Team, the former making it for the first time while the latter ends her career with two first-team selections.</p>\n<p>The two played vastly different roles but were both vital for the success of the team over the last four years. Schornstein was a defensive stalwart during her time at UCSB and had both the tasks of maintaining the defense and creating the attack. Her ability to do both so well was what led to her starting 75 of 77 possible games in her career.</p>\n<p>Ball, on the other hand, was one of the greatest attacking threats UCSB has ever had, and this year she became the first UCSB player in a decade to score 10 goals or more in consecutive seasons. She led the Big West in goals (10) and points (22) and consistently carried the Gauchos to victory when the team wasn’t playing well as a whole. The impact that these three players had this year was immense; however, the team as a whole still had some setbacks that they will certainly look to address in the offseason.</p>\n<p>One focus for the Gauchos going into next season will be tightening things up on the defensive side of the field. UCSB gave up more goals than all but two other teams in the league this year, tying Cal Poly at 25, which is a statistic that Head Coach Paul Stumpf will surely want to correct going into his 20th season.</p>\n<p>Still, that stat is partially deceiving, as the Gauchos did not give up more than two goals in a game in their last month of play, which shows that they have the potential to become one of the stingiest defenses in the Big West.</p>\n<p>However, two glaring questions remain going into next year: Can UCSB maintain consistency on the defensive end for the length of an entire season? And how is it going to fare with two of its best defensive presences in Schornstein and senior defender Kate Shoemaker having already played their last games as Gauchos this past Sunday?</p>\n<p>Another big question is going to be how the Gauchos will replace the offensive production of Ball, who was a huge reason that UCSB ended the season as one of the top offensive teams in the conference.</p>\n<p>UCSB finished fourth in the league in goals (24) and third in the league in assists (23), which is a good indicator moving forward that the majority of its goals were a byproduct of good ball movement and passing and not just the result of amazing skill by Ball, who deserves acclaim for her production.</p>\n<p>As mentioned before, one answer to this question of offensive production that the Gauchos will surely be hoping for is the continued improvement of Maurer, following the newcomer’s standout season. Although Ball is leaving some huge shoes to fill, Maurer seems more than capable of taking on a bigger role as she transitions into her second year.</p>\n<p>This last season was rough at times. The Gauchos lost to teams they should have beat and couldn’t put together enough wins to qualify for the postseason.</p>\n<p>Yet, the determination of the players to continue to improve, to play their best defense at the end of the season and ultimately to give it their all every time they were out on the field made it so that even with the losses this season, it could be considered nothing less than a success and a learning experience.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

However, it was UCSB who came out on top, and the subsequent three points awarded to the Gauchos were enough to not only place them at first in their division, but also at the very top of the entire Big West table standings.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Early on, many could tell that this matchup was going to be very much revolved around possession’s sake. Surprisingly, much of all play remained in the middle third of the pitch with very few attempts on goal or crosses to the middle even occurring. Officiating was also very sharp as several close offside decisions were called. Nonetheless, the Gauchos weren’t yet aware, but they were about to play their closest game of the year. Fortunately, it also turned out to be a significant win for them as well.</p>\n<p>Following kickoff, the first half started out very aggressively as it only took 10 minutes before UCSB was granted a yellow card. This would be the first yellow card out of a total of 4 through the remainder of the game as play was filled with consecutively fierce challenges.</p>\n<p>However, Sacramento State probably would have leveled for a yellow card worthy challenge; instead an ill timed handball within the 18 yard box placed the Gauchos in a dangerous position to score. And score they did.</p>\n<p>The first goal on the day came in the 19<sup>th</sup> minute of regulation time off said free kick, and it was none other than freshman forward Rodney Michael who put his team on top. Michael put his laces through the dead ball from about 10 yards out as the Gauchos celebrated their early lead.</p>\n<p>Yet, soccer is a game full of surprises as the Gauchos weren’t able to bask in this goal’s glory for very long since Sac State started to pepper back at them with attack after attack. Ultimately, it was No. 10 for the Hornets who helped find his team level at 1-1. Sac State junior midfielder Dominic Scotti belted in a well hit shot from almost 18 yards out and found himself with a lucky deflection of a Gaucho defender as the ball rolled into the back of the net. Now tied at one a piece, tensions on both sides began to simmer down and the half time whistle sounded as both teams returned to their locker rooms in order to formulate a better plan of attack.</p>\n<p>Both head coaches made the substitutions they deemed necessary in order to alter the attacking momentum, but it was to no avail. The second half of play pretty much was a defensive spectacle as both lines held their own on each side of the final thirds of the pitch. Only a combined two more shots on goal were recorded for the two teams. Soon enough, the final whistle came and the pressure was on as exhaustion began to creep in on both sides.</p>\n<p>The overtime ruling was simple; both sides would continue playing through the game clock until one side scored. Once again, the passing was present once more as the two teams chose to patiently chart out their plan of attack. But Michael only needed one more try at the goal in order to award his team with a much deserved victory. This time assisted, it was sophomore forward Ignacio Tellechea who picked out an open Michael. Then, with an almost clear line of sight at the goal, he curled in his shot into the far right of the net. The team celebrations then began for UCSB as the close bout turned into three points and a well-earned victory.</p>\n<p>After this performance, Tellechea now finds himself in second place on the team’s assist category. But who’s in first you ask? Well it’s the so far undisputed team MVP: Rodney Michael. Michael now has a grand total of four assists, but most impressively he’s now recorded seven goals in his seven matches played on the season. Thus, he must now be in consideration when the league MVP talks commence later on in the year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now improve to the No. 1 overall spot in the Big West conference rankings with their total of 14 points in seven matches. They’ll look to cement their position and add to their tally this weekend in a home game against the division’s second place team: UC Davis.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79238\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/ucsb-claims-big-west-no-1-spot-beat-sac-state-in-overtime/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79238\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/ucsb-claims-big-west-no-1-spot-beat-sac-state-in-overtime/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/ucsb-claims-big-west-no-1-spot-beat-sac-state-in-overtime/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/ucsb-claims-big-west-no-1-spot-beat-sac-state-in-overtime/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/ucsb-claims-big-west-no-1-spot-beat-sac-state-in-overtime/","id":1381,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1380,1379,1378],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Best Sac State in Upcoming Conference Match","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-171014-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-171014-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos hope to jump back to the top of the Big West North standings beginning with a win at Sac State.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Phew, we can all now take a breather from last Saturday’s nail-biting Blue-Green rivalry game against Cal Poly, which ultimately ended in a heated double overtime tie.

The Hornets are coming off a 2-0 loss against conference leader UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Its record may not show it, but Sac State has been able to compete at the highest level all season long, and with its amount of wins, it finds itself at third in the Big West North.</p>\n<p>Notably, the Gauchos are at a flat 1-1-1 record in conference road matches this season. Playing away from home has been an issue for UCSB, as it is 1-4-1 on the road, including the non-conference portion of its schedule.</p>\n<p>Considering both teams’ history with each other, however, the Gauchos are at a very solid advantage with their all-time record versus Sac State, sitting at a favorable 13-4-3. Regardless, UCSB must not count out any of their opponents, especially due to these close standings; everyone will be pushing for a postseason spot.</p>\n<p>Some key players for Sac State are two of their best playmakers. Both are underclassmen and forwards, beginning with Hornet freshman Justin Bedig, who has been phenomenal in the creation of plays all season long.</p>\n<p>He leads his team in the assist category with a total of six assists on the year, not to mention a pair of goals to add to his name. Meanwhile, his sophomore peer, Christian Webb, also leads a statistical category as the team’s leading scorer with six goals on the year.</p>\n<p>On the Gauchos’ side, freshman forward Rodney Michael still resides as one of the team’s most valuable players as he leads in both scoring and assists, with five goals and four assists.</p>\n<p>Adding more depth to his current hot streak of performances, Michael is also second in most shots on goal in the entire Big West stat standings.</p>\n<p>We also briefly mentioned his teammate, freshman Gaucho goalkeeper Alan Carrillo, last week when he won the Big West “Defensive Player of the Week” award. Including last week’s 0-0 tie to Cal Poly, Carrillo continues his impressive entrance to college soccer with now two clean sheets.</p>\n<p>Carrillo also impressively leads the entire Big West in goals against average with a 0.96 percentage and is currently marked as second in total save percentage with a .754. Of course, part of Carrillo’s success can be attributed to the formidable defensive line he leads in front of the goal, but nonetheless, the Gauchos have been able to get the job done and will look to close out strong come Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>The Sac State game will truly be a test of Santa Barbara’s endurance, as it will be a mid-season divisional matchup with much on the line.</p>\n<p>Both sides bolster a young productive roster and will want to get those three coveted points that will bring them that much closer to a playoff selection seed.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos visit the Sac State Hornets this Wednesday, Oct. 18. Kickoff commences at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79173\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/gauchos-look-to-best-sac-state-in-upcoming-conference-match/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79173\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/gauchos-look-to-best-sac-state-in-upcoming-conference-match/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/gauchos-look-to-best-sac-state-in-upcoming-conference-match/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/gauchos-look-to-best-sac-state-in-upcoming-conference-match/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/gauchos-look-to-best-sac-state-in-upcoming-conference-match/","id":1379,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1378,1377,1376],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Anticipates Its Home Finale, Will Host UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017.10.14_StephenManga_MSoccer-23-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017.10.14_StephenManga_MSoccer-23-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos look to ride the momentum of a 2-1 win over Sac State which put them back in first place in the Big West North as it takes on UC Davis.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Harder Stadium welcomes the Gauchos for the last Saturday night home game of the regular season, during which they will play the UC Davis Aggies just three games away from the start of the postseason.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara comes into this matchup fresh off a 2-1 Golden Goal victory at Sac State Wednesday and now boasts a 6-5-4 overall record.

The goalkeeper also added two more saves in the match against the Hornets.</p>\n<p>Carrillo has played outstandingly, and his six shutouts are a testament to his ability as a goalkeeper. The six clean sheets on the season for the keeper also speak to the defensive success of this team, as the Gauchos have often relied on their defense to keep them in a game in which their offense was slow to start.</p>\n<p>His 0.96 goals against average ranks first in the Big West, while his 0.75 save percentage ranks second and his 15 goals allowed ranks third.</p>\n<p>The offense has shown their strong capability to score throughout the season, particularly in a 5-2 win against Cal State Fullerton. Fellow freshman forward Randy Michael played a huge role in the Gauchos’ offensive resurgence over the last nine games, in which they’ve gone 6-1-2.</p>\n<p>Michael has scored all seven of his goals in these past nine games, including two scores against Sac State on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The seven shots in goal rank tied for second in the Big West. The California native also has four assists on the year, the best mark on the team, as well as his 18 total points.</p>\n<p>The Saturday night match presents an opportunity for the youthful squad to address the problems seen in their last matchup against Davis: defensive struggles from the keeper down through the defense and onto an offense, which could not answer Davis back after allowing each goal.</p>\n<p>UCSB has a very good shot at seeing Davis again in the postseason, and it will be better for the Gauchos to beat Davis and address the concerns now than to have to do it later on, especially when it comes to securing a possible first-round bye for the first week of the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play the Aggies at 7 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 21, at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p><img class=\"ajT\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Oct. 19, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79183\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/ucsb-anticipates-its-home-finale-will-host-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79183\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/ucsb-anticipates-its-home-finale-will-host-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/ucsb-anticipates-its-home-finale-will-host-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/ucsb-anticipates-its-home-finale-will-host-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/ucsb-anticipates-its-home-finale-will-host-uc-davis/","id":1380,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1379,1378,1377],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
