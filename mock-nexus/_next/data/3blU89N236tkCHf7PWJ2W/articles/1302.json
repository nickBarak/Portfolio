Thursday night’s match began neck and neck as both teams peppered in early shots with none hitting the mark or really testing the goalkeepers. By the 14th minute of play, several set pieces were earned as each corner kick posed a threat to open the score for either side. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it was UCSB’s incessant pressure at the middle of the pitch that caused the visitor’s first, and determining, error of the game. And at the 24-minute mark, it was senior forward Sahid Conteh who scored the crucial goal for the Gauchos — bringing the home side up one nil. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was Conteh’s brilliant work rate that caused Redhawks midfielder Hamish Ritchie to force a pass back to his teammate, Nkosi Burgess. All Conteh had to do at that point was to dispossess Burgess, dribble to the right of the penalty area to get Seattle goalkeeper Akili Kasim out of position, and then slot in the ball perfectly across to the opposite post — which he did, and made it look easy whilst doing so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was Conteh’s first goal of the season, as he shares the team-leading goalscorer spot with six other Gauchos. The remainder of the first half of play saw a bit more confidence in UCSB’s play, with the team dominating possession more and more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore forward Carter Clemmensen for the Gauchos received the first yellow card of the match as UCSB closed the half with their 1-0 lead. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Highlights of the second half include two spectacular saves by UCSB’s sophomore goalkeeper Ben Roach, not to mention a shot by Seattle University that bounced off the crossbar. Burgess did his team no favors after being sent off in the 55th minute due to a studs-up challenge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was a match ridden with fouls — 34 in total — but the unnecessary red card had the Redhawks playing down to 10 men for the majority of the second half. Ritchie also went on to get booked in the 76th minute. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the Gauchos, Conteh and sophomore midfielder Sam Fletcher were also painted yellow for their fouls in the second half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, UCSB managed to hold off Seattle University for a solid 1-0 victory at Harder Stadium and they’ll look to take this momentum into this weekend’s matchup. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will be staying at home again this week for their seventh regular season installment as UCSB hosts the UMBC Retrievers this Sunday, Sept. 22, at 7:00 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

id=\"caption-attachment-90494\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / The Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a successful final weekend of the season, the UC Santa Barbara women’s soccer team has clinched a spot in the Big West Tournament for the second straight year. A win over Riverside and a tie against Irvine secured Santa Barbara a 4-1-3 conference record and a second-place finish in the regular season conference standings. Now, the Gauchos will head to Fullerton where two more wins will clinch them their first Big West title and NCAA Tournament appearance since 2009. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the semifinal, UCSB will face Cal State Northridge, the only Big West team to have defeated them during the regular season. The Gauchos and the Matadors faced off on Oct. 17 in Northridge and CSUN emerged victorious by a score of 1-0, thanks to a goal scored by Avery DeWitt in the 34th minute of that game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal State Northridge is 11-6-3 on the season and 5-3 in Big West play. The team has five players who have recorded multiple goals on the season, so there are many capable offensive threats. Still, redshirt junior Bethany Fitzsimmons and sophomore Alexis White do a bulk of the scoring with 11combined goals between them. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Matadors are by no means an elite offensive squad, but their solid team defense is capable of strangling teams and gutting out low-scoring wins. CSUN leads the Big West by a large margin with .77 goals allowed per game and they have recorded 10 shutouts, meaning they held a team scoreless in half of their games this season. They play great team defense but they are also anchored by quite possibly the best goalie in the Big West in sophomore Amanda Delgado. Delgado leads the Big West in both save percentage (.808) and goals allowed per game (.87) in just her first season as a full-time starter.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Northridge has held steady since their win over UCSB, going 2-2 in their next four games with losses against UC Davis and Cal State Fullerton. They are not on any sort of hot streak coming into this tournament, but anything can happen in two games, especially with their elite defense; the Matadors are contenders as much as anyone for the Big West crown.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is a vastly different team stylistically than CSUN because the Gauchos are a team that will go as far as their offense can take them. More specifically, the Gauchos will go as far as Shaelan Murison, frontrunner for Big West Player of the Year, can take them. That statement is not a hyperbole, because Murison has scored in 12 separate games this season, and UCSB’s record in those games is 7-0-5. Murison leads the conference in goals with 17, a mark that ties her with Jennifer Borcich for the ninth most single-season goals in UCSB history. Murison received her fourth Big West Women’s Soccer Offensive Player of the Week award last week, which is the most for any Gaucho in a single season. She has also recorded a goal or assist in eight of the last nine contests, so it is safe to say she is primed to lead the Gauchos into the Big West tournament. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But UCSB’s future does not entirely rest on Murison’s shoulders because her surrounding cast is full of excellent players such as junior Isabella Viana, who is second on the team in both goals and assists with 4 and 5, respectively. Sophomore Jessica Wright and freshman Dylan Lewis also both have 3 goals apiece this year and have been major contributors in several Gaucho wins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will look to take the first step towards a conference title at 5 p.m. on Thursday in Fullerton.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Big West Tournament semifinal with an overall record of 8-5-5, competed against Cal State Northridge this past Thursday as the squad looked to secure a birth in the Big West Tournament final. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their last matchup, Santa Barbara finished with a tie against UC Irvine where the team was simply unable to find the back of the net in overtime. Senior forward Shaelan Murison and sophomore defender Lauren Hess scored 1 goal each for the ‘Chos. After grabbing a 2-0 lead, UCSB gave up 2 straight goals that were only 42 seconds apart in the 80th minute of the matchup. The game would end in a tie as neither team was able to score in the overtime periods. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Matadors, 11-7-3, were looking to pick up their 12th win of the season as well as their second win against the Gauchos. Cal State Northridge is led by junior redshift forward Bethany Fitzsimmons who has 6 goals and 2 assists on the season. On the defensive side of the field, sophomore goalkeeper Amanda Delgado anchors the defense as she has posted an impressive 76 saves along with a save percentage of 80%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Murison paced the Gauchos in the first half as the star forward put constant pressure on CSUN’s defense. Despite having multiple attempts on goal in the first half, Delgado was able to redirect the shots away from goal. UCSB was the more aggressive team in the first half as the Gauchos had 11 shots in comparison to only 3 shots for Cal State Northridge. Even though the ‘Chos were able to have more opportunities, the score was still 0-0 heading into halftime. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half was much of the same as neither team was able to find the back of the net. Cal State Northridge did find their rhythm though as the Matadors were able to put 7 shots on frame but were still unable to score. Both goalkeepers had played really well entering regulation as they combined for a total of 15 saves in regulation. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In overtime, sophomore forward Alexis White scored the golden goal to punch the Matadors’ ticket to the Big West Conference final. It was a disappointing loss for Santa Barbara as the squad had multiple opportunities to take the lead during regulation. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although UCSB did not finish the season the way they would have liked, it was still a very successful season — the team was able to finish with 8 wins. One of the main focuses for next season will be for the team to learn how to win the close games as they finished with 5 ties this season. With a year of experience for ‘Chos, there is a lot of confidence amongst the team to grow and turns those ties into wins next season. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, it will be important for a scorer to emerge next season as this was the last collegiate match for star forward Shaelan Murison. Murison finished the year with a team leading with 17 goals and 7 assists. She was undoubtedly the team’s best offensive player and her production will definitely be missed next year. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another player that will be missed is senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese who was incredible in front of goal this season. DeWeese tallied 5 shutouts, 47 saves and a save percentage of 74.6%. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The future is bright for the team however as there are many freshmen this year who will grow into their roles next year as they look to make an impact. For head coach Paul Stumpf, this season can be built upon for next year where the ‘Chos will look to compete for the Big West title once again. </span></p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-89891\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / The Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB women’s soccer team recorded their third win of the season this past Sunday to put them at an overall record of 3-2-3. Behind a hat trick from senior forward Shaelan Murison, Santa Barbara was able to find the back of the net four times to give them a comfortable win over Loyola Marymount. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loyola Marymount entered this game winless and on a four-game losing streak, putting them at an overall record 0-7-2. It has been a disappointing season thus far for the Lions as the team has been unable to form an identity on the offensive end of the field. With an extremely young team, Loyola Marymount has steadily gotten better in terms of their chemistry as they look to improve every game. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara started off with an intense amount of pressure early on as the squad looked to cause turnovers in the Lion’s half of the field. Santa Barbara was able to score in just fifteen minutes as Murison scored her first goal off of a lead pass from junior forward Isabella Viana. Viana has played well as of late, as it seems that she is stepping up in terms of being a playmaker on the offensive end of the field. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Murison would score her second goal in the 24th minute and third goal in the 56th minute of the contest to complete her hat trick. This was an encouraging sight for the Gauchos as despite Murison finishing all three goals, the goals were assisted by three different players. UCSB has struggled to find players to emerge on the offensive side of the field next to Murison but that narrative seems to be changing. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loyola Marymount was able to get on the board in the 66th minute of the contest as sophomore forward Sydney Schultz netted her first goal of the season. Just five minutes later, junior midfielder Olivia LaCasto scored to get the Lions within one goal of tying the ball game. Throughout their season, the Lions have struggled to finish their opportunities inside the penalty box. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB would put the game away with a goal from Viana putting the ‘Chos up 4-2 in the 89th minute, effectively putting the game out of reach. Although the game became close toward the end, it was an overall solid performance from the young team that has aspirations for a Big West title. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara has seemed to have caught fire as of late as the squad is now riding a two-game win streak in which the team has outscored its opponents by two and a half goals. Much of this can be attributed to not only the improved offensive play but the steady play of senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese. DeWeese’s confidence and quick hands combined with the Gauchos’ stout defenders has led to an extremely formidable defense as a whole. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With just two games left until conference play begins, UCSB will need to keep up their high level of play in order to hit the ground running in their first interconference matchup, which is just a couple weeks away. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for the Gauchos to continue the success that they have been having as of late, it will be crucial for the squad to remain poised and continue to persevere even when facing adversity. For younger teams, it is more difficult in general but there are seniors on the roster who can ensure that the team remains calm in those moments. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara is back in action this Thursday against Santa Clara in an away game at 7:00 p.m. where the Gauchos will look to add on to their two-game win streak against a very talented Broncos squad. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89890\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-23/ucsb-womens-soccer-takes-down-lmu-for-third-consecutive-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89890\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-23/ucsb-womens-soccer-takes-down-lmu-for-third-consecutive-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-23/ucsb-womens-soccer-takes-down-lmu-for-third-consecutive-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-23/ucsb-womens-soccer-takes-down-lmu-for-third-consecutive-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-23/ucsb-womens-soccer-takes-down-lmu-for-third-consecutive-win/","id":1301,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[1300,1299,1298],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
