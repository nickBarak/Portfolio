The New Yorker magazine published a profile on Zhang in February, and Filmmaker George Csicsery premiered a documentary on Zhang called “Counting from Infinity” in January. Zhang’s major breakthrough earned him numerous awards and honors, including the 2013 Ostrowski Prize, the 2014 Frank Nelson Cole Prize in Number Theory, election to the Academia Sinica fellowship in 2014 and tenure professorship at the University of New Hampshire in 2014.<br>\nUCSB mathematics professor and number theory specialist Jeffrey Stopple said it is unusual for mathematicians to be featured in The New Yorker.</p>\n<p>“He’s probably at this point one of the most famous mathematicians in the world,” Stopple said. “I think there might be only maybe two or three others alive that have his level of celebrity.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang said he hosted Zhang’s visit to UCSB during a mathematics department colloquium in May and he personally invited Zhang to join the faculty as a professor.</p>\n<p>“I was honored to be able to host his visit to our campus and to invite him to become a professor, a colleague and a friend on our campus,” Yang said in an email.<br>\nAccording to UCSB professor emeritus in mathematics Martin Scharlemann, Zhang currently stands as one of the most prestigious professors at the university.</p>\n<p>“There are various types of prestige in mathematics. One is to be known by experts in your field and another is to be known by the general public,” Scharlemann said. “At least in the second category, he’s probably the most remarkable here at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>UCSB mathematics department chair and professor Darren Long said he hopes Zhang’s presence in UCSB’s math department will increase the amount of interactions between professors and expand the department’s range of research.</p>\n<p>“This is not an enormous department, so we don’t have representation in every field possible,” Long said. “He is somebody that opens up a vista in that way.”<br>\nAccording to Stopple, hiring Zhang will significantly increase the university’s prestige and will attract even more students in the future.</p>\n<p>“I think it raises the profile of the campus enormously,” Stopple said. “In terms of recruiting new students at UCSB, I think at all levels people will want to be here.”</p>\n<p>Long said he offered Zhang a reduced teaching load to start, but assumes Zhang will want to increase it because of his extensive teaching history at the University of New Hampshire.</p>\n<p>“It is my impression that he will want to teach undergraduates from time to time,” Long said. “I expect he will succeed.”</p>\n<p>University of Massachusetts Boston mathematics professor and former University of New Hampshire’s mathematics department chair Eric Grinberg said Zhang has always been a humble faculty member, despite his worldwide fame.</p>\n<p>“He was always very modest and unassuming and he certainly never boasted of anything,” Grinberg said. “Even though he’s become world famous, I don’t think that’s changed too much.”</p>\n<p>Grinberg said students at the University of New Hampshire found Zhang’s teaching style to be “very much accessible” and “easy to follow.”</p>\n<p>“Some people might try to impress everybody by how deep their work is and get them lost in technicalities,” Grinberg said. “Yitang Zhang doesn’t do that.”</p>\n<p>Stopple said Zhang’s next goal is to solve the Landau-Siegel Theorem, an important piece of a larger and more difficult problem called the Riemann Hypothesis, a 150 year-old mathematical conjecture with a one million dollar prize attached to it.</p>\n<p>“He sets his sights very high and I’m very impressed by him,” Stopple said. “Even the piece that he’s working on would make him famous all over again if he wasn’t already famous.”</p>\n<p>Stopple said it is unlikely Zhang will be able to solve the Landau-Siegel Theorem during his time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“In some sense, it would be like someone being struck by lightning twice,” Stopple said. “It’s ambitious to try, but he’s the guy who’s willing to try stuff like that.”</p>\n<p>Yang said UCSB is an ideal place for Zhang to teach while also conducting research.</p>\n<p>“Our campus provides both the intellectual environment and spectacular beauty for him to enjoy continuing his research to solve unsolvable math problems while also teaching our students,” Yang said in an email.</p>\n<p>Yitang Zhang was unavailable for comment.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 in the Thursday, Sept. 17, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Program, which recognizes incoming undergraduates who show potential in academic, research and student leadership positions and provides them a minimum of $120,000 in financial support.</p>\n<p>The program allows students and their families to plan for all four years of tuition as opposed to traditional financial aid programs, which are on a year-by-year basis. Scholars are given a minimum of $120,000 to go towards tuition, room and board, loan fees, health and books. The program was created by Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Claudine Michel and Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships Director Michael Miller after they recognized a fundamental issue with the traditional financial aid program design.</p>\n<p>Miller said a major obstacle families with financial need face is having to commit to paying for four years of education though traditional financial aid programs only provide funding one year at a time.</p>\n<p>“I can’t think of any other major purchase that works that way,” Miller said in an email. “By providing students with a four-year outlook, they are able to focus on why they are here, which is to get a world class education and entrench themselves in the UCSB community.”</p>\n<p>According to Miller, UCSB stands as number three on the Top Colleges Doing the Most for Low-Income Students list by The Upshot, which measures colleges’ efforts on economic diversity.</p>\n<p>“We do a great deal for low income students at UCSB,” Miller said in an email. “Approximately 75% of undergraduates at UCSB have financial aid and we disburse about $400 million annually. For most families, a UCSB education would not be possible without some sort of financial aid.”</p>\n<p>Miller said the new Promise Scholars program is offered to dedicated students from areas of California where it is less common for high school graduates to attend UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We really were not sure how the program would be received so we made a modest number of offers and we focused on areas of the state we have not been able to recruit students to UCSB in the past,” Miller said in an email. “All of the students selected for the Promise Scholar program were highly meritorious and showed a great deal of potential.”</p>\n<p>Academic Initiatives Associate Director Mark Shishim said he is confident that this group of Promise Scholars will positively impact the UCSB community in more ways than one.</p>\n<p>“This is an extraordinary group of students – I’m confident their contributions to our University will be evident in scholarship, leadership and citizenship,” Shishim said in an email. “I’m honored to be a part of their journey and proud to welcome them to the Gaucho family.”</p>\n<p>Miller said he has very high hopes for the program and wants to see the students involved on campus without worrying about finances.</p>\n<p>“I would love to see our Promise Scholars become campus leaders, work closely with faculty, participate in research and give back to the UCSB community in some way,” Miller said in an email. “By eliminating the guessing game about whether they can afford to stay at UCSB, we are hoping to see positive results in all aspects of our students’ lives.”</p>\n<p>Miller said the program could change the way financial aid is administered across the UC.</p>\n<p>“I truly believe we are on to something with multiyear financial aid awards,” Miller said in an email. “If we remain thoughtful and continue to collaborate across our campus, I think this could revolutionize the way financial aid is administered at the University of California and beyond.”</p>\n<p>Promise Scholar Advisor Natalie Gonzalez said the promise scholars benefit from various resources and opportunities to which other students do not have access.<br>\n“One of the things they are invited to is a faculty night, and that is just for them to be able to meet other faculty members on campus,” Gonzalez said. “In the Winter Quarter will be workshops on budgeting and how to renew financial aid applications, making sure that they are meeting those deadlines as well.”</p>\n<p>Gonzalez said she wants to introduce Promise Scholars to research opportunities and other resources.</p>\n<p>“We will have more information on how to get involved in undergraduate research, how to talk to faculty members, how to seek mentorship, and overall how to be exposed to the different resources that UCSB has to offer,” Gonzalez said.</p>\n<p>Gonzalez also said she hopes the program will build a support system for the scholars that will increase retention.</p>\n<p>“I hope they have peers that they can contact and connect with in order to have that home away from home support system with each other, but also with staff, faculty and other community members that are here to support them,” Gonzalez said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
