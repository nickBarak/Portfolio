He is the most athletic specimen the game has ever seen. At 6’ 8” and 270 pounds, he has the most unique blend of size, strength, speed, instincts and jaw-dropping athleticism to ever grace the court. His ability to play and guard 1 through 4 while demonstrating more consistent defensive intensity than Kobe also makes him much more versatile.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LeBron, at just 26 years of age, has played seven fewer seasons and roughly one-third the numbers of playoff games as Kobe. This is important to consider simply because he has had far less opportunities to make big shots, or shine in “clutch” situations as Kobe is so over-glorified for.</p>\n<p>Moreover, using the NBA’s measure of clutch play — the final five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime with a margin of five points or fewer — LeBron has again proved to be far more efficient than the Black Mamba in each of the last four seasons. Believe it or not, when Kobe is on the floor in crunch time, his Lakers are actually outscored by their opponents.</p>\n<p>In fact, LeBron has actually performed better than Kobe at the end of tight playoff games. Over the course of Kobe’s playoff career, he has connected on five of 20 attempts when having the opportunity to make a potential game-tying or go-ahead field goal in the final 10 seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime, (or 25 percent compared to the league average over the same time of 28 percent). Conversely, LBJ has made five of 12 of these same shots during his playoff career (41.7 percent).</p>\n<p>When the two have met head to head, it is yet another landslide victory for King James. James-led teams are 9-5 when meeting with Kobe’s, while playing most of those games on teams with far inferior talent. Bryant has also benefited from playing for the most decorated coach in NBA history. During that infamous 2004-05 season, with Coach Phil Jackson on vacation and Lamar Odom, Caron Butler and Chucky Atkins as his sidekicks, Kobe led his team to a miserable 34-48 record and an 11th place finish in the Western Conference.</p>\n<p>James, on a team with comparable talent in 2009, led Mo Williams, Zydrunas Ilgauskas and co. to 66 wins. Also intriguing, this season the Cavs, with a vast majority of their roster still intact, stumbled to a pathetic 19-63 record in their first year without King James — finishing dead last in the Eastern Conference.</p>\n<p>Hate him or love him, LeBron is the most dominant player in the game today. Though Bryant does have five titles to his name, we are not measuring who is the most decorated, but rather who is the best.  LeBron is the best, and frankly, has been for the last four years.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Daily Nexus<em> reporter Tyler Hayden will be tweeting the night away after Ravi’s response.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-38115\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-09/tweeting-storm-kobe-lbj-debate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-38115\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-09/tweeting-storm-kobe-lbj-debate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-09/tweeting-storm-kobe-lbj-debate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-09/tweeting-storm-kobe-lbj-debate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-09/tweeting-storm-kobe-lbj-debate/","id":2126,"author":{"id":80,"name":"Sports Editor"},"related":[2125,2124,2123],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":80,"name":"Sports Editor","biography":"Not available","articles":[190,191,270,273,284,730,752,861,883,885,917,926,1166,1331,1342,1520,1713,2126,2135,2140,2143,2151,2999,3001,3056,3246,3287,4558,4563,5160,5383],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Book Bank is a student-run service that addresses this problem, offering thousands of textbooks </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in all subjects </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to loan for the entire quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Book Bank, located in the Annex across from Storke Tower, is in its fourth year of operation. The problem it faces, however, is a lack of awareness. Of the 2,495 books in the collection this quarter, only 97 were checked out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year communication majors Catherine Barber and Jonathan Lee are working to solve this problem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barber and Lee took Professor Walid Afifi’s Social Marketing (COMM 168) course in Fall Quarter 2018, where students create proposals to resolve problems in the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So my group in particular wanted to help reduce the cost of textbooks for students, just because a lot of students already have a lot of financial burden in their lives,” Barber said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our solution was to come up with some sort of textbook sharing program. But that led to us discovering the A.S. Book Bank.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barber and Lee sent surveys to around 80 students while creating their proposal, and only one student mentioned the Book Bank by name. Both Barber and Lee were unaware of the Book Bank before they began this project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I literally knew nothing about the Book Bank,” Lee said. “I didn’t even know where the Annex was. That was another thing, we recognized that not a lot of people knew where the Annex was.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Barber and Lee heard about the Book Bank, they knew partnering with the organization would be the best way to solve the problem of high textbook prices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s really different from other things that already exist on campus,” Barber said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A.S. Book Bank is unique because students can check out books for an entire quarter without returning them. Other free options such as course reserves at Davidson Library limit students to two hours in the library with checked out textbooks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the course of Fall Quarter 2018, Barber and Lee created a proposal to make students more aware of the Book Bank, which included updating their website and utilizing social media platforms. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86659\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86659\" data-attachment-id=\"86659\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/a-s-book-bank-gains-new-exposure/as-book-bank_cameron-hsieh_online-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AS Book Bank_Cameron Hsieh_ONLINE-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-86659 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AS-Book-Bank_Cameron-Hsieh_ONLINE-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86659\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Book Bank’s marketing plan is a collaborative process between Barber, Lee and Jordan.

Book Bank, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Book Bank’s marketing plan is a collaborative process between Barber, Lee and Jordan. The three meet biweekly and regularly email about their plans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pretty much everything Jonathan and I do, we run by [Jordan]. So we ask her what she needs, and she gives us ideas of what we can do. One of the main things she said she needed help with was marketing, and so that’s kind of the main thing Jonathan and I have done,” Barber said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their strategy for the Book Bank was to increase awareness of the program and make it easier for students to check out books. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To do so, Lee said he and Barber had created a new social media plan for the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I post on Facebook and she posts on instagram, and we have 100+ followers on instagram and 300+ likes on our Facebook. Apparently people show up at the Book Bank asking about it all the time at the Annex now,” Lee said. “The front desk person was like talking about how there are so many people that come by, and seeing an increase in that was really cool for us to see.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barber and Lee also updated the website so that the entire catalog is online. Students can search by title or ISBN number, and the website will show whether the textbook is available or checked out. Students can then go to the Book Bank to fill out an order form and pick up their textbook for the quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are plans to expand the website in the future so students can check out books completely through the website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the things we’re working on, which we haven’t quite figured out yet, is making it so you can check out the book completely online. Right now, we’re kind of working with the website and figuring out how to do that,”  Barber said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another main project of Barber and Lee’s marketing campaign is to promote further growth of the Book Bank through book donation. The Book Bank will hold a book drive during finals week, where students can donate used textbooks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The book drive is vital to the Book Bank’s growth because of limits on where the Book Bank can purchase textbooks from. The Book Bank isn’t allowed to purchase books from the Free &amp; For Sale Facebook Page or from the book exchange, because every single purchase made requires a receipt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The books acquired have to be through donations or through purchasing books and actually receiving a receipt at legitimate websites or the publishers in general,”  Lee said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There will be donation boxes for the Book Drive at the Multicultural Center, the Student Resource Building, the Pardall Center in Isla Vista and at the Book Bank.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of textbooks end up just sitting on people’s shelves or they get thrown away or they get sold for like 99 cents. That’s not doing anything to help anyone. So it’s just really helpful to donate your textbooks to a good cause and help future students like you save money,” Barber added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Book Bank’s expansion in the future includes plans to depart from the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee (SIRRC) and become an independent entity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SIRRC has been a great supporter and one of the main reasons the Book Bank has stayed alive for this long,” Jordan said. “As I started to work on improvements and future plans for the Book Bank, I realized that the Book Bank was outgrowing SIRRC and was ready to become a fully independent entity.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With the Book Bank being its own, there comes a lot quicker turn around on projects… as well as more money being focused purely on the Book Bank projects and improvements to provide the best resources for students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Jordan, Barber and Lee are all seniors, they are looking for others to continue their work in the future. This led to the creation of the marketing intern position, where more than 80 students have already applied.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We don’t want this project to just be a winter quarter thing. The marketing intern would just kind of take on what Catherine and I are doing right now, in terms of running the Facebook, managing the website and the Instagram,”  Lee said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The marketing intern would help spread awareness of the Book Bank after Barber, Lee and Jordan graduate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is probably unreasonable, but I think our goal would be to have every student at least know about the Book Bank,” Lee said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wish I had known about it sooner, and so even freshmen coming in to discuss it the way people talk about the course reserves, that it would just be common knowledge, and that people would recognize that this is a resource available to them.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

What they did get was Newton, an egomaniac who will need at least two seasons to prepare before he’s ready to compete at the NFL level. Even then, he’s not guaranteed to fit into an NFL system. For a team that gave up the second-most rushing touchdowns and was last in almost every passing category, drafting a developmental quarterback and no significant defensive help will certainly come back to haunt them in the upcoming season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>New England Patriots:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>First round selection: OT Nate Solder</strong></p>\n<p>The NFL community seems to believe that Bill Belichick is a crafty genius when it comes to the draft. As an ardent Patriots fan I’d like to believe it, yet it is hard for me to see the reason in not drafting a pass-rusher before the sixth round. Sure, Solder might be the heir apparent to the aging Matt Light and QB Ryan Mallett is almost certainly that for Tom Brady — but why draft another corner when they’ve already spent high picks in previous years on Darius Butler and Devin McCourty, and have capable veteran Leigh Bodden to back them up? The most confusing selection of all might be that of tight end Lee Smith in the fifth round after drafting two highly skilled tight ends last year. Maybe Belichick knows something the rest of us don’t. Still, leaving your greatest need unaddressed is never a good idea.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Best</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Buffalo Bills:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>First round selection: DT Marcel Dareus</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Bills had a lot of problems last season but their main one was defense — particularly their rushing defense. They gave up a total of 335 first downs last season (fifth most in the league) and 138 of those were rushing first downs — more than any other team gave up. Because of this, they used their first four picks to revamp their defense at every level with Dareus, CB Aaron Williams, LB Kelvin Sheppard and Da’Norris Searcy. They might have considered spending a pick on a QB, but Ryan Fitzpatrick showed promise last season and they must have faith in him. They addressed their immediate needs and should be a better team when the new season begins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Detroit Lions:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>First round selection: DT Nick Fairley</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After giving up 1999 yards on the ground last season, 18 rushing touchdowns (fifth most in the league) and an average of 4.5 yards per carry, the Lions desperately needed a big body up front to stop the run. They got that in Fairley, who will certainly start next season. Their second pick, WR Titus Young provides them with a speed option for when QB Matthew Stafford has to get rid of the ball quickly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

id=\"caption-attachment-84758\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Food for All Coalition held its first meeting at the Biko Garage on Friday. <em>Laila Voss / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The coalition – made up of various students groups dedicated to fighting food insecurity – was created last October following the UCSB Food Security and Sustainable Food Systems Leadership Retreat.</p>\n<p>“[The retreat] was awesome; it was having everyone together because that never happens [and] we were drafting different ideas,” Michaela Austin said, a fourth-year sociology and environmental studies double major and student ambassador for the UC Global Food Initiative, said.</p>\n<p>The retreat brought together student organizations including the Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank, CalFresh, the UC Global Food Initiative, the Edible Campus Program, FoodCycling, Food, Nutrition, and Basic Skills Program, the Food Security Taskforce Student Reps, ECOalition and Food Security Peer Advisors.</p>\n<p>For Austin, who presided over Friday’s meeting, the goal of the coalition was obvious.</p>\n<p>“[The purpose is] very simple. Update each other, build coalition[s] and again, the goal is to get food insecurity on campus to as low a rate as possible,” Austin said. “If there is a problem we all agree on, let’s go to the UC with a unified voice.”</p>\n<p>Some of the positive updates and successful programs on- and off-campus were discussed at the opening of the meeting as well.</p>\n<p>Gabriel Etaat highlighted the achievements of the CalFresh Advocacy Team and the A.S. Food Bank. He explained that the CalFresh Advocacy Team had over 76 engagement activities during Fall Quarter 2018, which included tabling and enrollment parties.</p>\n<p>“We got well over 2,000 people enrolled in CalFresh that we know of through the program and this year’s benchmark is 6,000,” Etaat, a fourth-year economics and environmental studies double major and USDA Food Insecurity Research intern, said.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, several students also discussed the accessibility of food security and sustainability programs are to underserved students. Marilu Bedolla, a fourth-year language, culture and society major, noted that Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients are unable to access CalFresh.</p>\n<p>Due to their ineligibility for the federal program, which has no locally funded alternative, undocumented students remain neglected, Marilu emphasized.</p>\n<p>“That is a constant issue that we don’t know what to do with it. CalFresh pulls in a huge amount of resources into this campus, but again, because undocumented students are not eligible for that, what do we do?” Austin replied.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“CalFresh pulls in a huge amount of resources into this campus, but again, because undocumented students are not eligible for that, what do we do?”</p></blockquote>\n<p>“Right now, the main things we have been pushing [are] what we do have on campus, which are the food pantries and free prepared meals.”</p>\n<p>Jack Greenberg, a third-year cultural anthropology major and employee at the I.V. Food Co-op, brought up the possibility of having a plot of land in the <a href=\"http://ucsbosl.orgsync.com/org/ghgp/home\">Greenhouse and Garden project</a> to serve the undocumented population.</p>\n<p>“One of my friends is looking to start an undocumented plot in the Greenhouse and Garden project … hopefully that will be a resource also where it can be already paid for and once it grows actual food can be [made available].”</p>\n<p>Those in attendance also expressed concern about CalFresh availability at on-campus convenience stores, stating that the Arbor remains the only on-campus institution to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsbs-arbor-now-accepting-calfresh/\">accept the program</a>.</p>\n<p>The lack of whole foods, particularly raw fruits and vegetables, at the Arbor was another point of concern with food availability for CalFresh recipients.</p>\n<p>Students also discussed the closure of the UC Global Food Initiative, which was intended as a short-term kickstart for campuses to address food security.</p>\n<p>“We still have to do that work; we want [those programs] to be funded — it’s not a given,” Austin noted.</p>\n<p>The Food for All Coalition is in the process of becoming a permanent standing committee under A.S. with support from A.S. Senators Anthony Hernandez, Rafael Cornejo, Gabriella Shofet and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/\">Sydney Karmes-Wainer</a>.</p>\n<p>“We accept everyone who wants to come, whether they’re on-campus organizations or off-campus organizations [and] as a standing committee under A.S., you get all the benefits of A.S. as well,” Hernandez said.</p>\n<p>Hernandez wants to work on increasing turnout for the meetings. He noted his concerns about having a low turnout of students since the meetings are scheduled for Fridays.</p>\n<p>“We thought about having a night market while we have the meeting since it’s Friday night and people are going to [Del Playa]… We want to build a culture around it, so that way people know about [Food for All].”</p>\n<p>The Food for All Coalition holds biweekly Friday meetings at Biko Garage from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>Caleb Brown is a reporter at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calebbrown/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Caleb Brown</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Caleb Brown is a reporter for the Daily Nexus.
