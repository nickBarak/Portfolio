Queer Commission, board member of the Student Affairs Student Council, director for Coalition for a Better UC and diversity education coordinator for the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel is currently a Letters and Science Senator on the A.S. Senate, was First Senate President Pro-Tempore, a social conduct caseworker for the Office of the Student Advocate and is a coach on UC Santa Barbara’s mock trial team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During opening statements, both Kopel and Dumalo spoke about wanting to unite the campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Throughout my time here, I’ve seen a lot of good, but I’ve also seen a lot of division,” Kopel said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao echoed that statement, explaining that there is an “A.S. bubble” on campus and said he wants to make sure that “all of our voices are heard.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Topics discussed at the forum can be seen below:</span></p>\n<p><b>NUMBER ONE PROBLEM:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said one of the biggest problems facing students on campus are financial problems and identified the $66 fix, an item on the Democratic party platform focused on free higher education, as a way to help with this issue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel agreed with Dumlao. She referenced her position within UCSB’s Lobby Corps and said students need to put pressure on the state legislature to fund the UC.</span></p>\n<p><b>ADVOCACY:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel spoke of her time on the senate, stating Senate has passed several resolutions in support of various communities on campus, specifically the LGBTQ+ and Jewish communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Obviously I am not a part of all of the communities on campus and I can’t empathize with every single community, but as a woman, as a member of the LGBTQ community and also as a Jewish student, I can definitely sympathize with members of marginalized communities and I will always work to be their resource,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said as president, he would make sure that every community is heard at every level, specifically within A.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he has been doing work with marginalized communities “pretty much my whole time at UCSB through protests, plannings, meetings, pretty much everything under the sun.”</span></p>\n<p><b>PRIORITIES:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said his priority as president would be making sure that A.S. listens to the general student body because “A.S. shouldn’t be deciding on what we focus on based on ourselves, we should be talking about the needs of the community members and making sure that they understand that we are here for them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel said A.S. needs to prioritize completing projects that may be lost from year to year and creating a continuing projects coordinator position within A.S.</span></p>\n<p><b>EXPERIENCE:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said he has been involved with “every space on campus” and referenced his time with the RCSGD and Queer Commission among others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel again spoke of her time on senate and about her experiences with marginalized communities on campus. She said her time on campus has allowed her to develop relationships within A.S., the administration and the Office of Student Life that would allow her to succeed as president.</span></p>\n<p><b>NEWCEN:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel said her personal opinion on the University Center project does not matter to students and encouraged students to vote based on their own opinions. Kopel recently announced her opposition to the UCen project through a Facebook statement on Sunday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said “renovating the UCen is really, really important” but said he believed the renovations should not be paid for with student fees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students can vote in the A.S. election on G.O.L.D. from April 23 to April 26.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

With Frank Gore, who has posted four consecutive 1,000-yard seasons as your running back, and Alex freaking Smith as your quarterback, those numbers should be reversed.</p>\n<p>In a quarterback-driven league, Smith, who has three touchdowns and seven interceptions, just doesn’t cut it. Because the Niners have a few offensive weapons like tight end Vernon Davis and wide receiver Michael Crabtree, they believe they can be a versatile offensive team. But nobody can perform if Smith doesn’t step it up. Davis has slowed down considerably after his breakout campaign last year, and Crabtree, who was vastly overvalued heading into this year’s fantasy drafts, has as many touchdowns as Chancellor Yang this season.</p>\n<p>The Singletary train seems to be slowing down considerably. Sure, Singletary was an amazing player and is a master motivator, but his talents as a coach are yet to be seen. Penalties have hindered San Francisco repeatedly this year, and a more structured, schematic coach may fit the squad better. To come back in the division and make a playoff push, Singletary is going to need to motivate and coach.</p>\n<p>It could be that the 49ers are just losing on purpose to get a shot at drafting Stanford’s Andrew Luck. Surely they wouldn’t fuck up again by passing on the local hero, as they did in 2005 when they drafted Smith #1 overall over Cal’s Aaron Rodgers. Ouch. I feel bad for Niner fans just writing that.</p>\n<p>There are few positives for the NFL franchise with the second most Super Bowl victories of all time. We all know linebacker Patrick Willis is an absolute beast. All over the field on every play, Willis looks like he is becoming the next Ray Lewis. Additionally, safety Taylor Mays has been making the most out of his playing time, and is looking like he can be the game-changing athlete he was at USC. That duo could be staples of a solid defense for years to come.</p>\n<p>The best thing going for SF is their weak division. The NFC West is BY FAR the worst division in football. With the non-convincing Arizona, St. Louis and Seattle squads all at 2-2, San Francisco could still easily come back and win the division.</p>\n<p>So to all you 49ers fans in I.V. out there: HAHA. Just kidding. At least the only way to go from here is up…</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

Associated Students, she said serving as the 2017-18 internal vice president was the most rewarding.</p>\n<p>“[The end of my term is] welcomed because I’m exhausted, but it feels great because I’m very proud of the work that I’ve accomplished,” Sandhu said. “I’m very proud of the work that I helped others accomplish, and I’m incredibly grateful for all the skills that I’ve gained, the experiences [and] the friends.”</p>\n<p>Sandhu was elected to the position of A.S. internal vice president (IVP) during the 2017 Spring Quarter Elections after running with Campus United (CU).</p>\n<p>She ran with the intent to streamline A.S. and improve communication between the Boards, Commissions and Units (BCUs) and the A.S. senators.</p>\n<p>Before serving as IVP, Sandhu served as a College of Letters &amp; Science senator within A.S. Senate. She also served as a student representative in the Internal Affairs Committee the year before.</p>\n<p>Early on in her term, Sandhu said she had to adjust her approach to the position after realizing the weight of her role as a resource to the 25 senators in A.S. as well as her own office staff. This involved connecting senators with the resources they needed and giving them guidance as they worked to pass legislation and accomplish their personal projects and goals.</p>\n<p>“I’d say my primary focus was really empowering the senators, and I feel like I did a pretty good job of doing that,” Sandhu said.</p>\n<p>When training senators, Sandhu said she focused more on logistics such as legislative procedure and how meetings ran.</p>\n<p>During the A.S. Senate retreat, she said she tailored senate trainings to include what was taught in previous years as well as tenets she believed were important to note as well.</p>\n<p>Sandhu said some senators mentioned they could have used more direction, but she said it was mostly from those who did not attend the retreat.</p>\n<p>“I think that I did a fairly good job,” Sandhu said. “I think they moved into the groove of being in senate faster than I’ve seen happen in the past.”</p>\n<p>IVP is required to plan and attend trainings during their term, such as the Safe Zone/Queer 101 training which must be completed by the sixth week of Fall Quarter, according to the A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p>Sandhu said in years past, such trainings weren’t usually completed by week six due to students still settling into their positions. Sandhu was home very frequently this year and at times needed to postpone the trainings due to personal issues.</p>\n<p>“My mom got diagnosed with an illness so I had to be back pretty often,” Sandhu said. “Weekends that worked for me didn’t necessarily work for senators, so it was a lot of back and forth, and we just did not get to do that.”</p>\n<p>One of Sandhu’s goals at the beginning of her term was to increase accountability, specifically by publishing quarterly reports of how student fees were being spent. Sandhu’s intent with the quarterly reports, after speaking with her student fee advisory commissioner, was to create a “color-coded, user-friendly” website similar to that of UC Davis’s.</p>\n<p>However, the plan was halted after she received opposition from the Finance and Business Committee.</p>\n<p>Sandhu also expressed pride in the accountability of the senators this year, especially in their work with BCUs, saying that there have been a “lot of positive reviews” unlike in previous years.</p>\n<p>She credited her director of the legislative accountability, Greg Katz, as playing an important role in her ability to stay updated with the senators.</p>\n<p>“He was just a really good director of legislative accountability,” Sandhu said. “He went to their office hours weekly and made sure they were there and talked to them about what they needed and what projects they were working on and how he could help or I could help in any way, and then he would report back to me each week and let me know what they needed from me.”</p>\n<p>According to Sandhu, showing respect was an important part of making sure senators were completing their responsibilities and felt comfortable coming to her and Katz for help.</p>\n<p>“We weren’t here to just say you’re not doing your job but rather to make sure they had all the tools necessary to do their job,” Sandhu said.</p>\n<p>Regarding any projects she had planned but did not accomplish, Sandhu said she could have worked more on bridging the gap between the student body and A.S.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately most of my attention went to internal processes this year rather than bridging that gap, so I think I wish I could’ve done that more,” Sandhu said.</p>\n<p>One of Sandhu’s proudest moments this term was watching senators speak to each other after tense meetings. After one particular meeting wrought with high emotions and heavy subjects, Sandhu noted all the senators were “very sweet” to each other.</p>\n<p>“[Senate] has been very toxic in the past, so one thing I wanted to do this year was make sure that they knew they were all working toward the same goal of bettering the campus,” Sandhu said. “I don’t know if it was entirely me that went into play, but I think I did a fairly good job of maintaining that atmosphere, and they all took the initiative to continue to maintain that atmosphere.”</p>\n<p>Steven Ho, a second-year biology and Asian-American studies double major currently serving as an on-campus senator, will succeed Sandhu as IVP for the 2018-19 academic year.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the May 17, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
