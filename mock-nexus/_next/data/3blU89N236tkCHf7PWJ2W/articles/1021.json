However, the Gauchos play them at what may be their most vulnerable time of the season, as they are coming off consecutive blowout losses to Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>“Hawaii’s sitting at the top and we’re gunning for them,” Boser said. “They have everything to lose and we plan on taking it from them.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos haven’t been playing their best ball either though, finding themselves in an up-and-down stretch over the last month and a half that has seen them go 9-13 in their last 22 games.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara’s offense has struggled to put up runs in the past few months, the team has still been able to consistently rely on the leadership and two-way play of sophomore pitcher Shelby Wisdom.</p>\n<p>Wisdom’s 39 RBIs are good for second in the Big West, and she has compiled 119 strikeouts, fifth most in the conference, despite sharing a lot of time in the circle with junior Andriana Collins and freshman Alex Pingree.</p>\n<p>“Shelby has improved tremendously; she’s taken more of a leadership role and that’s been very helpful for everybody,” sophomore infielder Jenessa Jeppesen said. “She’s been a really good role model for everyone on the team just by setting an example by pushing herself and being the best she can be.”</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that it doesn’t exactly have one standout player on offense, Hawaii utilizes an overall balanced attack. To put the team’s numbers in perspective, Hawaii has five players with 30 or more RBIs this season, compared to just one for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine’s offense has put up an average of 5.4 runs per game in 2013, but what truly carries them is the remarkable play of their pitcher, senior Kaia Parnaby.</p>\n<p>With just six games left before NCAA Regionals, Parnaby has already struck out an incredible 301 batters this season. In second place behind her in the Big West is LBSU’s junior pitcher Erin Jones-Wesley with just 172 strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Parnaby’s 1.30 ERA is by far the lowest in the conference, and her 34-4 starting record is one of the best in the entire nation.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara and Hawaii kick off the weekend on Friday at 9 p.m. and finish their season series on Saturday with games at 5 and 7 p.m. All games will be at Rainbow Wahine Softball Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of May 2nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51142\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/its-all-business-in-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51142\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/its-all-business-in-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/its-all-business-in-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/its-all-business-in-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/its-all-business-in-hawaii/","id":1021,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1020,1019,1018],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson","biography":"Not available","articles":[121,137,246,247,249,250,342,355,358,359,360,377,378,380,384,386,390,394,397,399,400,404,405,413,415,417,418,421,428,432,435,436,438,443,445,459,460,462,463,464,466,469,475,477,480,482,483,486,495,497,498,499,500,501,505,545,599,843,967,968,971,982,984,985,986,987,988,989,990,991,992,993,994,995,1016,1017,1019,1020,1021,1023,1024,1025,1107,1147,1173,1198,1400,1462,1463,1464,1469,1470,1471,1472,1474,1476,1477,1478,1481,1482,1483,1485,1486,1487,1495,1498,1501,1502,1504,1507,1508,1509,1510,1511,1514,1516,1517,1519,1521,1523,1525,1533,1534,1535,1536,1537,1538,1543,1544,1545,1546,1547,1548,1551,1552,1553,1556,1557,1559,1985,1994,1999,2028,2033,2039,2066,3210,3219,3230,3241,3258,3285,3289,3291,3295,5051,5065,5067,5078,5083,5084,5086,5087,5090,5091,5092,5093,5094,5095,5096,5099,5100,5243,5262,5276,5277,5278,5279,5280,5281,5282,5283,5284,5285,5286,5288,5293,5305,5306,5308,5309,5312,5313],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB’s Ultimate Threat","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Softball_MarkBrocher_02.15.2013_DSC_78401.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Softball_MarkBrocher_02.15.2013_DSC_78401.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"Playing sports growing up, you can usually play whatever position you want to.

In only her sophomore season, Wisdom not only leads the Gauchos’ defense as the team’s top pitcher, but she is the team’s number one offensive force as well. With just six games remaining this season, Wisdom has compiled an astounding 39 RBIs, good enough to rank second in the Big West. She’s also first on her team with seven home runs and a .564 slugging percentage, second in batting average at .315 and hits with 47.</p>\n<p>She manages all of this offensive production while pitching just under 50 percent of innings played this season.

She also took time off from her role as pitcher to play outfield and shortstop at times.</p>\n<p>This caught the eye of two-time Big West Coach of the Year, UCSB Head Coach Brie Galicinao, who had been following Wisdom’s progress since her freshman year.</p>\n<p>Despite not expecting to be getting starter’s playtime once she was recruited by UCSB, Wisdom was quickly given a chance to show what she could do. Again, she did not disappoint. As a freshman, she shattered the school record for strikeouts with 247, and even broke the record for single-season wins with 24.</p>\n<p>She also showed that despite the transition to college, she could still make a big difference hitting the ball, as proven by her .271 batting average and 22 RBIs. Her efforts earned her the Big West Freshman of the Year award as she solidified herself as one of the team’s best players despite being one of its youngest.</p>\n<p>“She’s obviously naturally talented and really athletic but she works her butt off,” Jeppesen said about Wisdom’s ability to play both sides of the ball. “She’s constantly doing extra work and pushing herself to be the best she can be, and that’s really been beneficial to the team.”</p>\n<p>Wisdom’s impact as an all-around player is evident in her numbers, but it’s felt in more than one way on the field.</p>\n<p>“She’s in the center of the field all the time and she sets the motion and the tempo for everyone else,” Jeppesen also said. “When she gets the big hits it inspires all of us to follow up after her and get more big hits and when she strikes everyone out it pumps us up for offense.”</p>\n<p>This season, Wisdom has had less pitching time as she has been backed up by a more solid pitching rotation. On the other hand, her offensive stats have skyrocketed, and she has spent a lot of her time outside the circle playing outfield where she has a .947 fielding percentage.</p>\n<p>“She always wants the ball, she practices hard, even when she’s in right field she’s usually one of the loudest players on the field, she’s just in every play and competing hard every single pitch,” Galicinao said. “Those are the kind of people that every coach wants and every team needs.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, whatever position she plays or role she has, Wisdom’s number one priority is doing whatever she can to help her team reach their ultimate goal: Big West champs. With Wisdom playing the way she does on both sides of the ball, it wouldn’t be surprising to see her accomplish that goal during her time here at UCSB.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of May 1st’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51120\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/ucsbs-ultimate-threat/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51120\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/ucsbs-ultimate-threat/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/ucsbs-ultimate-threat/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/ucsbs-ultimate-threat/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/ucsbs-ultimate-threat/","id":1020,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1019,1018,1017],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Blowout Cal Poly in Senior Night Finale","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MBball_vsCalPoly-180303-DustinHarris-15-web-e1541647561688.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MBball_vsCalPoly-180303-DustinHarris-15-web-e1541647561688.jpg?resize=900%2C600&ssl=1","description":"UCSB earned its 12th home victory of the season with a win over Blue-Green rival Cal Poly.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>A 86-61 rout of Blue-Green rival Cal Poly on Senior Night secured the second best regular season finish in school history for the UCSB men’s basketball team. The Gauchos were knocked out of first place contention in the Big West with the loss to Long beach State on Thursday, yet their 22-8 overall, 11-5 conference record was good for second place and the second seed in the Big West tournament.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly ended the regular season with a 9-21 overall, 4-12 conference record and a date with UCSB in the first round.</p>\n<p>One of the key messages Coach Pasternack has been pushing since the beginning of his tenure with the Gauchos is the importance of a strong home court advantage. After a shaky season last year due to injuries, the revitalization of the Thunderdome has been huge both for the team and the school. The season finale was almost filled to capacity thirty minutes before the game, and the difference in atmosphere compared to the two home losses last week shows that the team really does feed off the hype of the crowd.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“While we are playing for ourselves, we’re also playing for the fans and everybody out there”, Max Heidegger explained postgame. “That energy carries over so when they get excited we get more excited.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were almost a little too excited to start off the match Sunday night, but once the pre-game jitters wore off they composed one of their best offensive games of the year. Early in the first half it was the usual suspects leading the way on the offense, as both graduate transfer Leland King II and sophomore Max Heidegger caught fire. The forward/guard duo combined for 26 of SB’s 38 points, which is a welcome sight heading into the tournament after the dip in production they’ve both had these last weeks. King II’s hot three point shooting helped UCSB build a double digit lead about halfway through the first period, and they ended the half up by eight.</p>\n<p>On the defensive end, center Jalen Canty’s return has energized the team. The Gauchos limited Cal Poly to 33.3% shooting in the first half, and a big part of it is how the senior anchors the defense. Other than junior Josh Martin who got much of his 23 points in garbage time, the Mustangs were not able to get anything going in the interior. While Canty does average almost 2 blocks per game, it’s actually his knack for getting defensive rebounds to close out possessions that really changes the game for UCSB. Cutting off second chance opportunities will be huge for the Gauchos going into the tournament, as previous losses against teams like Irvine and Davis show how vital winning the rebound battle is.</p>\n<p>UCSB blew the game open in the second half, and in the process put on a passing showcase. The team finished with a season high 27 assists, which is a school record, and shot 67% overall from the field for the half. Although ball movement has been a core tenet of this team since Coach Pasternack took over, it seems that the offensive synergy of the squad is picking up just at the right moment.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think I’ve ever been part of a team that’s gotten 27 assists in a game”, Coach Pasternack admitted. “ I think what we learned is that when we share the ball, when we have five people on the court that can shoot it’s hard to decide who to focus on… and if we share the ball like this we’re going to be tough to beat.”</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly it was guard Gabe Vincent who led the team in assists with 7 in his final home game as a Gaucho. The senior received a standing ovation as he left the court, and although he didn’t score as much his facilitation was what made the offense run smoothly. His ability to lead by sharing and yet still get points when needed are why he’s been the key player for this school for years.  While the team looks ahead to the tournament, it’s important to commemorate Vincent’s already amazing career as a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, UCSB plays the seventh-ranked Mustangs again on Thursday in the first round of the Big West tournament. Although this last game was a blowout, Coach Pasternack stressed postgame that the Gauchos are not underestimating their opponent. Coming off of a season where they didn’t even make the Big West tournament there’s no doubt that this team is hungry, it’s just gonna be up to the players to execute the gameplan.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

The win was the Gauchos’ first against a top-25 ranked team this year.</p>\n<p>The second game of the weekend was a completely different story as both teams’ offenses couldn’t be stopped. UCSB got off to a terrific start with senior shortstop Keilani Jennings hitting a two-run home run in the top of the first inning.</p>\n<p>Freshman utility Jessica Tetzlaff followed with a single to bring junior second baseman Kathryn Pilpil home and increase the Gauchos’ lead to 3-0.</p>\n<p>UCSB did not have control for long though, as Hawaii took a 4-3 lead with home runs by junior catcher Sharla Kliebenstein and senior centerfielder Kelly Majam in the second inning.</p>\n<p>An RBI from Pilpil and a throwing error by Hawaii in the third gave UCSB the lead again at 6-4, but two more home runs by the Rainbow Wahine put them back on top 7-6 and ended Wisdom’s day at pitcher.</p>\n<p>With Hawaii leading 10-6 in the sixth, Jennings made program history for Santa Barbara. With her second home run of the day, Jennings not only brought her team within one run, but she also picked up her 31st career home run, the most ever by a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Hawaii kept the momentum as senior shortstop Jessica Iwata put the icing on the cake in the sixth inning with her team’s fifth home run of the day, sealing an 11-9 victory.</p>\n<p>Jennings’ five RBIs tied her career-high for most in a single game.</p>\n<p>In the final game of the weekend, Hawaii played more like the dominant team that they have been all year. In just five innings, the Rainbow Wahine hit four home runs to earn a quick 8-0 lead and end the game on the run rule.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s will return home next weekend to play UC Riverside in its final three games of the season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51197\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-06/gauchos-steal-one-from-no-22-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51197\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-06/gauchos-steal-one-from-no-22-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-06/gauchos-steal-one-from-no-22-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-06/gauchos-steal-one-from-no-22-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-06/gauchos-steal-one-from-no-22-hawaii/","id":1019,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1018,1017,1016],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
