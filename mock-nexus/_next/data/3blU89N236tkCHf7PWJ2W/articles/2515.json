Students can create an A.M.P. profile that is personalized to them and their alumni network.</p>\n<p>A.M.P.’s goal is to nourish career development by providing students and alumni with consistent support. The A.M.P. website also provides customer support seven days a week.</p>\n<p>Hugo Pegley, Firsthand UCSB Campus Ambassador and UCSB alumnus, said job candidates with the most network connections are the most likely to get a job.</p>\n<p>“In our modern and highly-connected world, the best jobs don’t go to the smartest or hardest working candidates,” Pegley said in an email. “They go to the most connected candidates, candidates whose networks have taught them where to apply, what to write on a resume, and what to say in an interview.”</p>\n<p>Pegley said the company’s goal is to provide eligible career candidates with job opportunities.</p>\n<p>“At Firsthand, we don’t think it’s fair to employers, candidates, or the universities that educate them, that great candidates, with the right skills and motivation, should fall short of great jobs because they lack a network to teach them how to be successful applicants,” Pegley said in an email.</p>\n<p>Pegley said A.M.P. chose to come to UCSB because of intelligent students and their desire to find a job soon after graduation.</p>\n<p>“UCSB students are among the best and brightest in the nation, so it only makes sense that many of them are highly motivated and want to get ahead in their career search,” Pegley said in an email.</p>\n<p>Kiarash Payani, first-year pre-biology major, says that he was “truly impressed” with his experience with Firsthand.</p>\n<p>“I was surprised by how many different advisors are available for consultation,” Payani said. “Alumni in finance, business, medicine and many other industries were all there to help me explore my interests and passions.”</p>\n<p>Payani said she believes other students can benefit from A.M.P. because it provides connections to prioritize student career objectives.</p>\n<p>“This program could definitely help others the way it helps me, simply by providing others with the same resources and connections that they would also need in order to better plan their future careers,” Payani said.</p>\n<p>Students interested in booking a consultation can go to <em>ucsb.evisors.com/hugo</em>. All consultations are completely free. Students automatically get entered into a raffle for a $100 gift card upon enrollment.

focused on the speakers’ ideas for a movement from a two-state solution to a focus on smaller-scale initiatives for peace. The discussion centered on the notion that for the two countries to reach a definite resolution, they must first create trustworthy relations through the reconciliation and realistic negotiations.</p>\n<p>Makovsky is an adjunct professor at John Hopkins University’s Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies. He is the co-author of Myths, Illusions, and Peace: Finding a New Direction for America in the Middle East and frequently contributes to the New York Times, the Jerusalem Post and Foreign Policy.

Al-Omari has worked extensively within the Palestinian Authority, with roles including director of the International Relations Department in the Office of the Palestinian President and advisor to former Palestine Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas. He also played a key role in the Palestinian-Israeli peace process as an advisor to the Palestinian negotiation team throughout 1991-2001.

[Palestinian Authority]” would support a new paradigm that shifts toward progress.</p>\n<p>Makovsky said he hopes it is possible to shift away from the current five negotiation points of water, settlement, Jerusalem, mutual recognition and security because he believes the “five for five” deal is too absolute.</p>\n<p>“I think what you would do is — this new paradigm, when you want to flesh it out — is to say ‘okay, we’re not going to do the five for five. We’re not going to get the grand deal on all five issues,’” Makovsky said. “‘But we’re going to single a direction towards the two states, maintain a viability.”</p>\n<p>According to Makovsky, Israelis need to see less of a military presence in order to feel safe.</p>\n<p>“The army would stay exactly where they are. Of course they’d have less of a footprint because they’d have to protect less people, but I think for the Israelis living in Jaffa, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and other cities — all they want is to be safe,” Makovsky said.</p>\n<p>Makovsky said Israeli citizens want their government to be honest in explaining the country’s situation.</p>\n<p>“All they want is their leaders to tell them, ‘If I make gestures to the Palestinians, am I more secure or am I more vulnerable?’ That’s all they care about,” Makovsky said. “I think they’d care less if some small settlements outside of Nablus stay exactly where they are.”</p>\n<p>According to Makovsky, there needs to be a distinction between ideology of safety and individual safety.</p>\n<p>“So, what you’d be doing is decoupling these two issues and signal a new direction — tell the Palestinians you want them to have their own space, but because the region is a meltdown, you’re not going to pull the army out,” Makovsky said.</p>\n<p>Julie Alexander, fourth-year psychology major who attended the talk, said she heard about the event through Facebook and was interested to hear from individuals who have played key roles in international policy.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the time, all we get is media coverage,” Alexander said. “To hear the reasons why from a source closer to the issue is a really special opportunity.”</p>\n<p>Kimberly Ruiz, fourth-year global studies major, said she believes discussing the Israel-Palestine conflict from a new perspective could lead to a solution.</p>\n<p>“The discussion has the possibility to bring out new ideas,” Ruiz said. “Shifting the way a problem is approached can make some change.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Feb. 25 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
