","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I don’t want it to end, period, but more so, I don’t want it to end in the way I think it is going to. The question on everyone’s mind in this day and age is, “What have you done for me lately?” signaling a trend toward taking out the old and shipping in the people and things that are younger, faster and newer. Maybe it’s the hidden kleptomaniac in all of us, but we are obsessed with the glitz, the glamour and the overall shine of something new. This is why it might be all too easy for the Yanks to give the old boot to my man, Derek Jeter.</p>\n<p>There is an intense amount of pressure and tension produced by each and every one of those hostile fans who pour in from Yonkers all the way to the Bronx. Jeter can feel it, sense it, touch it; the feeling is palpable. They are quick to embrace and love when everything is going right for a guy, but are even quicker to leave that same guy out in the cold once he nosedives. New Yorkers are definitely not on the level of the average Philly fanatic, where every game determines their mood for the rest of the day, week or even month, mind you. However, they are swift in making judgments, and fall somewhere between the obnoxiously interested middle-American, high-school football fan and the on-and-off Warriors fan.  And being that NY’s pinstriped darlings won the World Series in 2009, fans are on red alert this year, expecting a duplicate performance.</p>\n<p>Duplicating a performance, especially in October, is where Jeter usually comes in. After the record year he enjoyed in 2009, with a .334 batting average, a .406 on-base percentage and a whopping .465 slugging percentage, he has dropped off considerably. Some cite his age; some, his mindset. Dazzling us with his perfect Crest Whitestrip smile and his bronzed, Adonis-like skin since the age of 21, he has found his way into my- or, I mean, our- hearts with his solid play and classy style.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>However, the Jeter we have all come to know, love and respect might be in hibernation mode —forever. His .270 batting average, .340 on-base percentage and .370 slugging percentage are all among the lowest he has logged since his first days in Yankee Stadium. However, with all this being said, I am a firm believer in the age-old adage, “It’s going to get worse before it gets better.” Derek (yes, I feel close enough to the man to call him that) is not just another player. Heck, he isn’t just another Yankee. He is THE Yankee. He is an old-school player in the new-school age, ready to seize a moment when it is ready to be taken. This is October, my friends, and he didn’t become Mr. October for sitting around the couch with the Dodgers, Angels and Pirates. This is his time, and he knows it. All Jeter detractors beware, because it is about the time when things get a whole lot better for the World Series champ.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26918\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/speace-mind-musing-derek-jeter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26918\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/speace-mind-musing-derek-jeter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/speace-mind-musing-derek-jeter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/speace-mind-musing-derek-jeter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/speace-mind-musing-derek-jeter/","id":2290,"author":{"id":95,"name":"Julia Speace"},"related":[2289,2288,2287],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":95,"name":"Julia Speace","biography":"Not available","articles":[913,919,1758,2136,2141,2148,2166,2213,2290,2297,2790,2811,2831,2870],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Green Advice for Green People: Regretting Draft Picks?

I know why you did it. I know it’s not your fault. Moss was coming off a season in which he accumulated 13 touchdowns and almost 1,300 yards, all with quarterback Tom Brady still recovering from an ACL tear. It was logical to assume that with a healthy Brady running the offense, Moss would have no problem eclipsing last season’s numbers. Those of you who believed this have been duped.</p>\n<p>So far, Brady’s throwing to anyone but Moss, who has accumulated a total of nine receptions for 139 yards, including a grand total of zero receptions in Monday night’s game against the Miami Dolphins.</p>\n<p>At this point, Moss owners have two options: Bench Moss and hope he turns it around or abandon ship and trade him.</p>\n<p>Trading a high profile player like Moss can be a difficult thing to do, but the longer you wait the less likely you are to get good value for him. I can guarantee you that in your league there is at least one owner in need of a wide receiver, and that same owner may still believe that Moss will turn his season around. If you act now, you may still be able to trade Moss and receive good value for him in return.</p>\n<p>However, most fantasy owners are not stupid. They might call your bluff. To sweeten the deal you might want to add into the mix one of your bench players who could fill a need on their team. The downside of this is that you now are losing two players, but in the end it will be worth it to have a productive player in Moss’s place. This plan can be used to deal with any big name player performing like Moss. Remember, a little trickery every now and then never hurt anyone… except the person being tricked.</p>\n<p>In any case, the second type of headache player is a bit more difficult to deal with. Titan running  back Chris Johnson provides the perfect example. Looking at the record-breaking numbers of Johnson’s 2009 season, his average draft position of 1.4 for this season seems justified. However, despite a couple of good performances, Johnson has been wildly inconsistent, as any fantasy owner unlucky enough to draft him first will tell you. He should not have been drafted one spot ahead of Vikings running back Adrian Peterson, who has been much more consistent this season.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it is unlikely that you will be able to get good value for Johnson in a trade. He is still one of the best players at his position, and he has the talent to turn his season around. But until he does, you should consider benching him for a more consistent performer, because as it is Johnson is just as likely to hurt you as he is to help you.</p>\n<p>Everyone has their draft day regrets. There is no such thing as a perfect draft because there are just too many factors outside the fantasy owner’s control. No one can account for injuries or unexpected slumps.</p>\n<p>What matters is how you deal with the rotten spots on your roster. If you deal with your underachievers soon enough, you may be able to prevent them from doing irreparable harm to your record.</p>\n<p>Make trades, work the waiver wire, watch for favorable matchups and adjust your lineup to make sure you trust your starting players to perform.</p>\n<p>Lastly, make sure no one tricks you into making a bad trade. It’s all fun and games until someone gets Randy Moss.</p>\n<p>Pick Up of the Week: BenJarvus Green-Ellis, RB, New England. Yes, the Patriots are on a bye week, but don’t let that stop you from grabbing Green-Ellis while you still can. So far, he succeeded where Laurence Maroney failed and has somehow convinced Bill Belichick to give him the ball consistently. He is still available in almost 30 percent of ESPN leagues and can provide you with good value at running back.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

students more aware of the services available to them. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Student advocate general (S.A.G.), a position within the Office of the Student Advocate (OSA), works to help students who “face charges from the University in housing, academic, social conduct, and public interest matters,” according to the OSA website.</p>\n<p>Ettleson, an independent candidate and third-year film and environmental studies major, currently works as the OSA chief of staff with the current S.A.G., Jack Tannenbaum.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus </em>endorses Ettleson with the expectation that she will continue her work in the office in a responsible manner, placing students’ rights at the forefront of the office’s work.</p>\n<p>Ettleson is running on a platform of “putting the job first,” as expressed during the S.A.G. <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-17/a-s-student-advocate-general-candidate-forum-martinez-vs-ettleson/\">forum</a> on Monday. She described the role of S.A.G. as “complex” due to the confidential nature of the cases the office handles, but said she would be as transparent as possible.</p>\n<p>If elected, Ettleson wants to improve the office’s outreach to make students more aware of the services available to them. Her first project would be focused on possibly creating a database organizing outcomes of previous cases, which would help with future cases, she said.</p>\n<p>Ettleson’s only opponent in the S.A.G. race, Grecia Martinez, advocates for improved outreach and communication with organizers to learn about students’ rights, rather than the current S.A.G.’s use of polling.</p>\n<p>Martinez’s platform offers a vision of inclusivity and outreach which Ettleson could benefit from adopting; however, Ettleson’s focus on impartiality is a critical point of the S.A.G. position, an issue from which candidates should not waver.</p>\n<p>The S.A.G.’s role as an impartial advocate for the rights of all students, regardless of diversity of opinion and background, is critical in defending the basic freedoms that students have as listed in the Student Bill of Rights in the A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the position of S.A.G. necessitates objectivity and the <em>Nexus </em>hopes that, if elected, Ettleson will perform to these standards.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 19 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82556\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/rose-ettleson-for-student-advocate-general/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82556\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/rose-ettleson-for-student-advocate-general/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/rose-ettleson-for-student-advocate-general/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/rose-ettleson-for-student-advocate-general/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/rose-ettleson-for-student-advocate-general/","id":2289,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2288,2287,2286],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nuglets of Wisdom: “Bitches Love That Surfer Vibe, Bra”","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“Dude.

Surfers hail from a broad variety of places and cultures. I have a lot of good things to say about most of the surfers I’ve met in my travels. Then again, I have a lot of bad things to say about a lot of the surfers I’ve met. And most of the latter group come from Southern California and Santa Barbara. The bros in particular.</p>\n<p>However, there is a rare breed of die-hard surfers I’ve met in Santa Barbara, who get things done under the radar, who don’t surf the beach in hopes of glamour, pussy and a beach bod.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you can spot them lurking in the back of a party around midnight, checking NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) before they allow themselves another drink. Sometimes you can hear them in the mornings around 5 a.m., rubbing sleep out of their eyes and wearily dragging their wetsuits and damp towels down I.V. alleys to their surfmobiles. Sometimes you have no idea they exist because they live as mountain men in Los Padres National Forest, well below your glitzed-out radar.  Probably the most noticeable giveaway of a salty sea-vet’s behind-the-scenes surf activities is when you overhear one noting the wind conditions late at night. Or when you’re at their secret spot and they’re threatening to drown your kook ass— you’ll also know then.</p>\n<p>These are the surfers who don’t immediately saunter up and brag about where they surfed or the waves they got that day — instead they are looking forward, always stretching toward more spots, more waves, better designs, increased stoke. What these elites pull from their sessions is the knowledge of the perfect combination of wind, tide, direction and light required to create the ultimate dawn sesh at T’s, ’Con, Lil’ ’Con and certain other areas up and down the coast.</p>\n<p>These aren’t the shaggy-haired blonde boys and girls sitting in front of you in lecture, sporting bright pink Electric shades, obscene blue trunks, sorority rush shirts and surfer-style trucker hats. Not the fools who stain their reps by going for broke all day. (“Hey bra did you see that epic set at Sands yesterday? I like totally busted a rodeo flip over the whole UCSB surf team.”)</p>\n<p>Instead, these are the people accustomed to the chain of maneuvers that settle you into the precarious overhang beneath a slabby tube. They see swell lumping in from the horizon and know precisely how to start the elevator drop down a watery cliff-face into exalted tubedome.</p>\n<p>Surfers thrive in every nook and urine-drenched alley of Isla Vista. They exist in abundance in the state, nation and most of the coastal world.</p>\n<p>The only problem with surf bro-ciety is that there are too many wannabee Jordys out there, but too few Gerry Lopezs. Everyone wants to throw the biggest air all the time — but guess what? — waves are made of water. Try staying in the water for a while before you get any grandiose ideas, big fella.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot to be said for the type of person who learns things the hard way — through patience, practice and persistence. And passion, I could add.</p>\n<p>As a side note, there is also that unique breed which owns a house in Montecito, dates 19-year-old models from UCSB and moonlights as a world-champion surfer. How does he do it? Is he human?</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus Surf Columnist Elliott Rosenfeld will drown your kook ass if you ever suggest that he’s getting laid again.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26911\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/nuglets-wisdom-bitches-love-surfer-vibe-bra/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26911\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/nuglets-wisdom-bitches-love-surfer-vibe-bra/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/nuglets-wisdom-bitches-love-surfer-vibe-bra/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/nuglets-wisdom-bitches-love-surfer-vibe-bra/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/nuglets-wisdom-bitches-love-surfer-vibe-bra/","id":2288,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[2287,2286,2285],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
