The rocky start is reflective of the poor on-the-road performance — captured by the 1-5 record —  that has so far been the pitfall of the otherwise undefeated group.</p>\n<p>Though the Gauchos’ 6-5 overall record still peaks just above the .500 mark, their conference record now sits at 0-1. Equal in total games, their competitors, the Sac State Hornets, fall far below SB, sporting a statistically unthreatening record of 3-6-2. Their defeat over UCSB in game 11 marked their first shutout since their third game back in August.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Santa Barbara succumbed to the vicious away-game losing cycle in the 79th minute when Sac State’s Matt Carnefix launched a low ball into the net for the only goal of the game — his first of the season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Freshman forward Benji Kikanovic stole a deflection off of the foot of SB’s Faouzi Taieb, allowing him to break away toward the center of the field. Kikanovic found Carnefix undefended on the far side of the box and executed a routine pass to instigate the goal.</p>\n<p>It was perhaps here that the UCSB roster missed goalie Ben Roach the most. Roach received a red card in the Gauchos’ last match against Cal Poly; this was the freshman’s first time not defending the net since the onset of the season.</p>\n<p>Standing in his place for his own seasonal debut was sophomore Alan Carillo. Despite the singular goal, Carillo appeared experienced and in control guarding the net. He tallied five saves in total, the most threatening one occurring almost immediately after Sac State scored.</p>\n<p>On the opposing side, rookie Ryan Curtis started his first collegiate game and matched Carillo with a career-high five saves on the night.</p>\n<p>The Hornets’ goal, though the ultimate mark of defeat, refreshed what seemed like one of Santa Barbara’s slowest games this season. The Gauchos failed to tally even one shot over the course of the first half, an unfamiliar statistic previously unseen amid their 2018 record.</p>\n<p>The second half, however, took a much different — yet, similarly unproductive — tone. UCSB’s offense began their attack immediately following the starting whistle, taking 12 shots from the 46th minute up until the final two minutes of the game.</p>\n<p>With just under seven minutes left in the game, the frontmen of SB’s roster made six final attempts at finding a last-minute equalizer, two of them being rips on goal.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now seek redemption as they travel down the coast and back to their untainted territory in Santa Barbara. UCSB remains undefeated on home turf, a record the roster will not let slip out of their hands easily.</p>\n<p>Gearing up to take on Cal State Fullerton, Santa Barbara must find a way to break through their two-game offensive stagnancy especially while facing Fullerton’s standout goalie Paul-Andre Guerin, who was named this week’s Big West Defensive Player of the Week.</p>\n<p>The Titans come into Saturday’s matchup with a lackluster 4-2-6 record, however, they have gained some steam heading into conference play with two wins against LMU and USF and a tie against CSUN. Their offense has been spearheaded by seniors Samuel Goni and Ross McPhie, with the former leading the team in goals (4) and the latter leading the squad in assists (4).</p>\n<p>This juxtaposition between the more experienced and tactical front line of the Titans and the youthful attack of the Gauchos should lead to an enticing clash of play styles, and hopefully a lot of goals.</p>\n<p>The Cal State Fullerton Titans threaten Harder Stadium and our winning record this Saturday at 7 p.m. for the second game of Big West conference play.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared in the October 4th print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em> on page 06.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

With his experience and intuition, the Gauchos have strong hopes for conference play and an astute game plan to further improve their successful year.</p>\n<p>“There are eight conference games; we’ve got to win four,” Stumpf said. “Four wins and 12 points has gotten [teams] into the Big West Tournament … the last couple years, we’ve lost one or two games early; we put ourselves in a deep, deep hole. That’s what we’re trying to avoid, so [Davis] is the most important game of the season for us.”</p>\n<p>As Big West play starts up this coming weekend, here is a recap of each Big West squads’ season up to this point:</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside, 9-0-1</strong></p>\n<p>The Highlanders burst out of the gates in non-conference play and have shocked opponents early with an unbeaten record heading into league matches. Riverside entered the season projected to finish in the seventh spot in the Big West but has reflected sheer dominance prior to conference play. The squad is 8-0 when competing on its home pitch this year and has only allowed one single goal in the first half of the season. This week, the team received votes in the United Soccer Coaches Poll for the first time this season and ranks third in regional rankings. Riverside will travel to Cal State Fullerton for its first conference matchup.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Hawaii, 5-3-1</strong></p>\n<p>Hawaii enters Big West play coming off back-to-back wins following the Rainbow Wahine Shootout tournament that was hosted by the squad. The Rainbow Wahine, who were projected to finish in ninth place in the Big West preseason poll, have surprised many in the front half of the season with winning records both at home and on the road. Hawaii opens league play on Friday evening as the team makes a road trip to UC Irvine.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>CSU Northridge, 4-3-1</strong></p>\n<p>The Matadors have shifted their focus to their first opponent of conference play, Cal Poly SLO, for a Friday evening road matchup. CSUN is unbeaten while on the road this season but sits at 0-3 while playing at home this year. The squad enters Big West play following a convincing 2-0 victory against Cal State Bakersfield last week.  Northridge opened the year in the projected fourth spot of the Big West preseason poll.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State, 5-4-1</strong></p>\n<p>Cal State Long Beach was forecasted to finish in the second spot of the Big West entering the 2018 season. Although the Dirtbags have struggled on the road this season with a 1-3 record, all four losses on the season have come against ranked teams: No. 2 USC, No. 8 University of Texas, No. 16 UCLA and No. 23 University of Auburn. Having significant experience against top-25 teams, Long Beach State is still considered a major contender in the Big West conference and a possible favorite for many analysts. The Dirtbags travel to Cal State Fullerton on Thursday for the first Big West Conference game of the year.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine, 4-5-1</strong></p>\n<p>Similarly to Long Beach, the Anteaters suffered a tough loss to No. 2 USC early on in the year. Of the five losses that Irvine has dropped this season, the Anteaters have been shutout in four games. The year kicked off with a first-place projection for Irvine, yet the squad has struggled as of late following a five-game road trip throughout September during which Irvine went 2-3 over that span. Hawaii travels to UC Irvine on Friday evening to kick of its Big West schedule.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>UC Davis, 3-5-2</strong></p>\n<p>The Aggies opened the year hosting the number-one team in the country as they suffered a tough loss to Stanford. The squad bounced back with a promising August, finishing the month with a 3-2 record, but they haven’t recorded a win throughout all of September. Davis was projected to finish in the fifth spot of the Big West preseason poll and opens conference play on a road trip to UCSB on Friday evening.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton, 3-7-1</strong></p>\n<p>While the Titans were projected to finish the season in the third spot of the Big West conference, Fullerton has struggled immensely this season, particularly on the road. CSUF has a 1-4-1 record in away games this year as the team has allowed 1.5 goals against per game on average. Following four straight losses, the Titans host Long Beach State on Thursday evening to open up Big West competition.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly SLO, 0-8-3</strong></p>\n<p>It’s been a disappointing season so far for the Mustangs as they have yet to win a game during non-conference play. Granted, the team has faced a plethora of ranked opponents this year, but they have been blown out by three or more goals in each of the games. The Mustangs are projected to finish in eighth place in the Big West Conference this year, as the team hosts a stiff CSUN squad for its first Big West matchup of the year.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>A version

Riverside got off to a confident start as it peppered shots early, forcing junior Hanna DeWeese to make a lengthy save in the 12th minute to keep the game deadlocked at zero goals a piece.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They started in the system that we expected, and then they made a very quick change that took us by surprise a little bit,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “This surface, it’s old, it’s very bouncy…it’s a hard place to play soccer, so we had to make an adjustment to our style a little bit as well.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the seven shots that Riverside took in the first half, only one of them was on target. While the Highlanders bested UCSB on the offensive end, Santa Barbara matched its defensive intensity by not letting UCR get high percentage shots in the first half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With game tied at 0-0 heading into the second half, once again Riverside came out firing as it blasted three shots within the first five minutes. Yet for a team that thrives in crunch time during half number two, the Highlanders were limited to just those three looks for the remainder of the entire second half until the final three minutes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think they took most of their shots in the first 15 or 20 minutes,” Stumpf said. “Once we made our adjustments and clamped down, their looks kind of evaporated…I do think once we made our adjustments in our system, the game changed dramatically.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half was dominated by the Gaucho attack as Santa Barbara fired eight shots at the goal, four of which were on target. Following a shot that sailed high from freshman standout Jessica Wright, Gaucho senior midfielder Jessica Clegg reentered the game for the final push from UCSB in the closing 10 minute frame. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clegg flew down the sideline looking to make an immediate impact in the 84th minute. With a quick feed into the box, senior captain Shaelan Murison received the ball with space and fired off a strike into the bottom right-hand corner of the net to give the Gauchos a late 1-0 lead over the unbeaten Highlanders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We finally put our goal scorer in a position were she could get a decent look at the goal with a little bit of time and space. She maximized her opportunity…she had to put the ball into a corner with a good bit of pace, no doubt about it,” Stumpf said regarding the knockout punch from Murison.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Riverside managed to fire off a last-ditch attempt in the 87th minute, but the shot drifted high as the Gauchos became the first team this season to knock off the Highlanders who are unbeaten no more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The finale of the 3-game road trip will take place next Sunday as the Gauchos travel to Cal State Long Beach to take on a 6-4-2 , 1-0-1 squad that looks to make a move up in the standings.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quotes courtesy of KCSB Sports and UCSB Athletics</span></i></p><div

The rivalry match between the two sides has accounted for 15 of the 19 highest-attended soccer matches in NCAA history, and every year it seems that both teams put their best foot forward in this match.<br>\nOn Saturday, when the Mustangs come to town, the stakes will be even higher for both sides.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, the team will be looking to avenge their 1-0 loss at Cal Poly earlier in the year. While they have already clinched at least the third seed in the conference tournament, a victory coupled with a Riverside loss to Fullerton would catapult the team into second place — securing them a first round bye in the tournament.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs face a much more perilous situation, needing all three points from Saturday’s match to even have a chance of making the Big West tournament. If they can pick up the away win at Harder Stadium, Cal Poly would still need losses by both Sacramento State and UC Davis to leapfrog into sixth place.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As of late, Cal Poly has dominated this rivalry game. Since Steve Sampson was appointed head coach of Cal Poly in 2015, the team has only lost one matchup to the Gauchos, with their last two trips to Harder Stadium both resulting in scoreless draws.</p>\n<p>When the two teams matched up earlier this year for a non-conference game, UCSB played one of their worst games of the season. Offensively, the Gauchos were one-dimensional, launching long balls toward the direction of sophomore forward Rodney Michael and hoping he could run onto one in space. While the team played well defensively, a wonder-goal by Mustang junior midfielder Diego Alonso ultimately proved to be the deciding goal.</p>\n<p>Since then, both teams have gone in opposite directions. Cal Poly has only won one match in the six since, with their latest loss a heartbreaking defeat to No. 1 UC Irvine. Due to their recent dip in form, the Mustangs have fallen to a 5-8-2 record.</p>\n<p>After a rough midseason stretch — underscored by the loss in San Luis Obispo — Santa Barbara is unbeaten in their past three matches, entering Saturday with a 9-6-1 record. In addition, the Gauchos remain undefeated at Harder Stadium, coming in with a perfect 8-0 record.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly primarily runs their offense through senior forward Sean Goode, who has collected seven goals so far this season. However, the Mustangs have struggled to score all season, with only 17 goals in 15 games. Against a stellar Gaucho backline that has allowed less than one goal per game this year, look for Cal Poly to once again struggle to find much room to operate.</p>\n<p>Similarly to the Gauchos, Cal Poly is a much stronger team on the other half of the pitch, only conceding 19 goals in 15 games. In the first matchup between these teams, senior keeper Simon Boehme played an outstanding game, making multiple key saves to keep the Gauchos off the board.</p>\n<p>If Santa Barbara hopes to reverse their fate on Saturday, they will need an on-and-off attack to be firing on all cylinders. The Gauchos will look to build on their second-half success against CSUN where the ’Chos scored three goals in a ten minute span. Much of that offense was predicted around junior forward Ignacio Tellechea, who was moved to striker to start the second half. While he still remains goalless this season, his movement up front opened up space for his fellow attackers.</p>\n<p>As has remained the status quo all year, the main goal threat for Santa Barbara is Michael, who has notched seven goals and three assists this season. His pace and skill moves make him a perpetual threat to find the back of a net, which the Gauchos will look to take advantage of on Saturday.</p>\n<p>With everything on the line for both sides, expect a chippy and heated affair in this year’s Blue-Green rivalry match. Kickoff at Harder Stadium will take place at 5 p.m. on Saturday.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on page 8 of the Oct. 25th print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.
