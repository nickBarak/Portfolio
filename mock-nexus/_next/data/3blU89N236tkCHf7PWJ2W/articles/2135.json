But as I’ve said all quarter long, ESS classes are not like most. I not only learned how to play a couple of new sports, but each class taught me something beyond the sport.

But after 10 minutes of wanting to smash my racket John McEnroe-style, I moved into volleys and got the confidence back up.</p>\n<p>In life, when one thing isn’t working, it can be helpful to look at it a different way. By the end of the quarter, I will have had about 20  lessons. I played tennis every day, but never in the same way, and I think I’m a better tennis player because of it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Soccer</strong>: <em>Forgiveness is important, even if someone seems to be proving otherwise.</em></p>\n<p>This class always frustrated me, simply because I don’t have the soccer skills to be really good, and sucking sucks.</p>\n<p>That being said, soccer can be a fun sport to play for the reason that it has aspects of gameplay that are far different from any other sport I’ve played. In basketball, for example, if you blow a layup on play, there’s a 99 percent chance you’re not getting the ball the next time around. Maybe it’s an American thing.</p>\n<p>In fútbol, your teammates are much more generous. I blow at least two or three breakaways per game. I would move to defense, but then the other team would just rack up goals, so instead I stay where I make the least overall impact on the game. Despite my shortcomings, I keep getting the feed to try again. It’s as if the entire team is working together for the best opportunity, no matter the player.</p>\n<p>Whenever you’re playing some kind of team sport, and probably sometimes in life, too, forgiveness can make a big difference.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Volleyball</strong>:<em> Putting in real effort when nobody is looking almost always translates into success when people are actually looking.</em></p>\n<p>Kathy Gregory exudes success. She has the swagger of a winner. That’s what I’ve learned from a year of following her women’s volleyball team fairly closely with the paper, highlighted by having her teach my class.</p>\n<p>Learning how to spike, serve, set and bump requires a certain technique. Learning the technique requires a lot of repetition.</p>\n<p>We do a lot of drills, and they weren’t always fun, especially in the beginning. As we move into more games and competition, not thinking about how to hit the ball makes the game way more fun.</p>\n<p>When you start a project, doing the bullshit stuff to get the train rollin’ is tedious and time-consuming. Three weeks later, when it’s time to put up or shut up, you’ll be glad you did the work before. We too can be Legends of our own Domes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Am I a new person after these 10 weeks of ESS classes? Let me answer that by saying I write this article currently in the midst of a munchies coma due to free IHOP pancakes day (and a burger and fries), so … no. But I do have a new repertoire of activities to break out when I want to get some exercise. There isn’t yet a rigorous workout schedule worked into my life, but it’s something. Who knows, maybe I’m just doing the bullshit stuff and it’ll pay off later. Let’s hope so.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

makeup company, which is primarily sold online and in select Sephora and Ulta stores, garnered fame for its liquid lipsticks when it first launched and has since grown to encompass a variety of skincare and makeup products.</p>\n<p>Mukai has only been working for the company as a marketing intern for three weeks, but during this time has focused on laying the foundation for the college ambassador program alongside her supervisors at Colourpop.</p>\n<p>UCSB was chosen as the pilot school for the ambassador program after Mukai was selected as the intern and because of Santa Barbara’s vicinity to the Colourpop headquarters in Oxnard, Calif.</p>\n<p>“This will be kind of the test run to see what works, what doesn’t work, how to make the program better, how can we fit it to Colourpop better, how can we fit it to campuses better, so that when we start recruiting more schools we have kind of like that basic blueprint work in order to keep it going,” she said.</p>\n<p>Mukai’s main responsibilities as the college ambassador include running the social media platforms and organizing giveaways and trunk shows to highlight Colourpop’s product lines on campus.</p>\n<p>Mukai said that her passion for makeup is what sparked her interest in working for Colourpop.</p>\n<p>“I just was looking at the Linkedin job page every other day for weeks, and then finally a job popped up and I applied for it. I had a few rounds of interviews, and thank god I got the job!” Mukai laughed.</p>\n<p>Since Mukai is within driving distance from the headquarters, she travels to the office twice a week, where she works closely with a wide variety of departments.</p>\n<p>“Colourpop, for people that are into business and things like that, is a completely vertically integrated company, so like everything from like the conception of a product all the way to it going out of the doors and to a customer is all through Colourpop,” Mukai said.</p>\n<p>She described the office as having a “start-up feel,” and praised the company for the number of women in authority roles, a stark difference from a previous employer.</p>\n<p>“For me being a young person going into the workforce …. it’s really cool to see all these women of power like just doing the work. They are the reason why the company runs,” Mukai added.</p>\n<p>Being in the office also allowed her to get a better sense of the company’s personality, Mukai said, which has helped her learn more about how to merge the company’s brand and UCSB’s brand.</p>\n<p>Mukai officially launched UCSB’s Colourpop College Instagram page on Tuesday, and said she was pleasantly surprised by the reaction from UCSB students, noting that the page reached 500 followers in the first 24 hours.</p>\n<p>“The interesting part is either people absolutely know what [Colourpop] is and they love it or they’re like ‘what is this?’” she said.</p>\n<p>She had previously worked for two years as the campus representative for PINK, a subset of Victoria’s Secret, which she believes is why she was hired to help launch the Colourpop College program.</p>\n<p>While she says the responsibilities are similar on paper, it’s been a learning curve for Mukai as she transitions from advertising clothing to advertising makeup.</p>\n<p>“I’m trying to take what I learned from UCSB PINK and apply it to this, but I realize more and more how different it is being a representative or an ambassador for makeup rather than clothing, ‘cause everyone wears clothing – not everyone wears makeup,” she said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86418\" style=\"width: 702px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86418\" data-attachment-id=\"86418\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/ucsb-student-lays-foundation-for-first-ever-colourpop-college-program/screen-shot-2019-02-21-at-11-46-49-am/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-21-at-11.46.49-AM.png?fit=692%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"692,650\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-02-21 at 11.46.49 AM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-21-at-11.46.49-AM.png?fit=250%2C235&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-21-at-11.46.49-AM.png?fit=692%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-86418 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-21-at-11.46.49-AM.png?resize=692%2C650\" alt=\"\" width=\"692\" height=\"650\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-21-at-11.46.49-AM.png?w=692&amp;ssl=1 692w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-21-at-11.46.49-AM.png?resize=250%2C235&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 692px) 100vw, 692px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86418\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Even though makeup is her passion, Mukai said she wouldn’t consider herself an expert. She plans on reaching out to students on campus to populate the Instagram page with creative, hyperlocal and “eye-catching” content.</p>\n<p>After getting the program off the ground, Mukai wants to focus on spotlighting these students, especially those “with smaller followings than the big beauty influencers, but [who] are equally, if not more, talented.”</p>\n<p>She said that one of her favorite aspects of Colourpop is their attention to smaller influencers, and hopes to continue that at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I’ve already found so many talented people on campus,” Mukai said. “I get to bring those people to the forefront, like ‘look how beautiful they are! look at that cut crease, or look at that skin!’ and just kind of hopefully give them also a platform to succeed.”</p>\n<p>One of the biggest talking points for the Colourpop College is the trunk shows that Mukai plans to host on campus. Since Colourpop is primarily an online store and only stocks certain Sephora or Ulta locations with a limited range of products, it is hard to get a good feel for the shades and textures of products before buying them, Mukai said.</p>\n<p>The trunk show plans to bring a large range of Colourpop products to campus so students can swatch, and even buy them, to their heart’s content.</p>\n<p>While Mukai is the sole college ambassador for now, she hopes that the program can grow both on campus and at college campuses across California and then across the country.</p>\n<p>“I think not only is this a great professional opportunity in terms of learning about the industry that you wanna be in, but also it’s just a really fun way to get to know people and share a community of people that love makeup and love beauty and love skincare and things of all those natures,” she said.</p>\n<p>Mukai’s love for Colourpop comes from both a consumer and a student point of view, she said. For one, Mukai praised the company for the affordability and quality of their products.</p>\n<p>“There is, more importantly, a range of colors that fit all skin tones, which I’ve been surprised to see,” she added.</p>\n<p>“I don’t mean to politicize makeup, but at this time and age, I don’t feel like you can’t politicize things, like I think that’s silly…. politics in some way touches every part of our lives, and I think that happens with makeup too, so it’s been great to see the makeup industry pay attention.”</p>\n<p>As she works to solidify the program in the coming months, Mukai hopes to ultimately build a community around beauty and skincare products for students.</p>\n<p>“I think that’s a really important part of this college program as it continues and hopefully grows, that they’ll be more of an uplifting of multiple people.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 21, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi is an asst. news editor for the </em>Daily Nexus <em>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or skamidi@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Hell, Phil Jackson once said Dennis Rodman was the most athletic player he’s ever coached. Not MJ.</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Statistically, Kobe and LeBron have each averaged over 30 a game more than once in their careers. Both have similar numbers in their primes (LeBron likely hasn’t reached his yet, Kobe’s over the hump), multiple All-Defensive First Team awards, MVP awards and so on. Kobe will never reach LeBron’s career 27.1 ppg average. LeBron may never replicate Kobe’s 81-point game. Still, they’ve both shown they can do whatever they want to on the court.</p>\n<p>But so has Dirk Nowitzki this season. So have Dwyane Wade and Carmelo Anthony. With so many players (eight this season) capable of putting up 25-plus points per game over a season, how should we measure greatness?</p>\n<p>Greatness should be measured by the number of rings a player earns on teams that he undisputedly leads. The “undisputed leader” distinction disqualifies role players on great teams from the list of the greatest.</p>\n<p>Kobe has five rings. Two of those rings were on teams where he was the undisputed star, but it can be argued that he rode shotgun with Shaquille O’Neal for the other three.</p>\n<p>LeBron has none. The Heat may win this season, but the league and media consensus is that the team belongs to Dwayne Wade or the trio of Wade, James and Chris Bosh. Not LeBron James alone.</p>\n<p>When discussing two players with the potential to go down in history in the top 20 players of all time, symbolism, peer perception and legacy are more important factors than statistics. This is why players believe some championships are better than others. This is why a January poll suggesting that 79 percent of general managers would choose Kobe over any other player to take the last shot — in spite of Kobe’s 25-percent rate in clutch situations — is so significant.</p>\n<p>Michael sweeping the Detroit Bad Boys on the way to his first championship: symbolically one of the most important moments of his career. Kobe winning his first without Shaq — symbolically his most important.</p>\n<p>James leaving his hometown team for greener pastures and the potential for a ring: symbolically the most detrimental action of his career thus far. Both MJ and Magic Johnson spoke out against LeBron’s move south, because both understood the importance of leadership to a legacy.</p>\n<p>LeBron was almost there in Cleveland, but he didn’t finish what he started and now we’ll never know how great of a leader he could have been.</p>\n<p>Symbolically, the Mavs’ sweep of the Lakers could mark the end of Kobe’s reign over the NBA or the beginning of a new Laker dynasty with fresh blood surrounding Kobe. I wouldn’t be surprised either way. But any player that comes to L.A. knows he’s giving up a chance at forging his own legacy in exchange for contributing to Kobe’s.</p>\n<p>For now, LeBron must settle for being the most athletic, most entertaining player in the NBA. He has a way to go.</p>\n<p>At least he’s still in the playoffs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Daily Nexus <em>NBA columnist Ravi Bhatia does far more things than just this column “Black Mamba style.”</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-38305\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-10/hoop-dreams-ravis-response-black-mamba-style/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-38305\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-10/hoop-dreams-ravis-response-black-mamba-style/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-10/hoop-dreams-ravis-response-black-mamba-style/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-10/hoop-dreams-ravis-response-black-mamba-style/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-10/hoop-dreams-ravis-response-black-mamba-style/","id":2133,"author":{"id":90,"name":"Ravi Bhatia"},"related":[2132,2131,2130],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Resolution Keeps Former A.S.

On-Campus Senator Zion Solomon and College of Letters &amp; Science Senator Xochitl Briseno proposed a resolution at the Jan. 23 Senate meeting which reflects on King’s impact during his time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>The resolution, officially known as “The King’s A+ For Excellence Awards,” will award five student leaders who each exhibit “outstanding contributions to A.S or the student body as well as academic excellence.” Each award includes a $500 grant funded by A.S., according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>Senate voted unanimously in favor of the resolution.</p>\n<p>“He was always going out of his way to support students academically and emotionally,” Solomon, a second-year history of public policy major, said. “That’s why I created the award, because it is specifically for students who go above and beyond who aren’t necessarily compensated for that.”</p>\n<p>Solomon, who first met King through a Guiding Underrepresented Individuals in Developing Educational Success (G.U.I.D.E.S.) Summer Orientation, remembered that he took the time to share academic tips to first-generation college students who were concerned about how to succeed in school.</p>\n<p>As an advisor, King, a former black studies major at UCSB, emphasized to his students the importance of grades and time management. King strived to ensure students had the time they needed to excel in school while fulfilling their roles in A.S. and extracurriculars, according to Solomon.</p>\n<p>“[King] would always walk into a room and be like, ‘How are we doing on grades? Thumbs up or thumbs down?’ or ‘Are we shooting for a 4.0?’” Solomon said. “Just reminding people that we’re students first and leaders second and he displays that as well.”</p>\n<p>Alexandra Gessesse, a third-year history of public policy major, former A.S. senator and student sponsor of the resolution, remembers first meeting King through the Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E) in her first year at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The first thing he asked me was ‘What do you want to do with your time here at UCSB?’” Gessesse said. “It hit me that someone sees me as more than my purpose of running with a party or running in A.S. or being a 4.0 student.”</p>\n<p>King often went above and beyond to make sure that the students he worked with received the attention they needed to succeed, she said.</p>\n<p>“There would be days, like even if he’s busy in a meeting, his doors’ window blinds are never closed – they’re open – so you can see in and he can wave at you, so he can acknowledge you,” said Gessesse.</p>\n<p>However, academics weren’t always on King’s radar.</p>\n<p>After being accepted into UCSB when he applied in high school, the university rescinded King’s acceptance after he received multiple failing grades during his senior year of high school.</p>\n<p>Instead of attending UCSB out of high school, King attended a community college for a semester in order to regain his acceptance from UCSB.</p>\n<p>Like many of the students he worked with, King had commitments outside of academics during college. He was a member of the UCSB men’s basketball team, a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, Incorporated, a transfer advisor, a member of 100 Black College Men and worked in the Educational Opportunity Program as well as the Early Academic Outreach Program.</p>\n<p>After graduating in 2001, King returned to the university to work as an assistant Judicial Affairs coordinator where he helped the run the judicial process for all university housing facilities on campus.</p>\n<p>King then left in 2008 to work as the assistant dean of students at the Claremont University Consortium.</p>\n<p>According to King, during his time at the Claremont University Consortium, he created a program called “A Plus,” where he helped give students academic advising.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“There would be days, like even if he’s busy in a meeting, his doors’ window blinds are never closed – they’re open – so you can see in and he can wave at you, so he can acknowledge you.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“Pretty much the way that I built A Plus was ‘What did I need when I was coming from Compton and Carson to Santa Barbara?‘” King said. “So I created A Plus for me… for 16, 17 year-old LaDonte King.”</p>\n<p>In 2011, King departed from the Claremont University Consortium. Four years after that, King found himself, once again, working for his alma mater.</p>\n<p>In the time spent between working for the Claremont University Consortium and UCSB, King managed two academic advising services: A+ For Excellence and Graduating Champions. Both services were derived from the A Plus program he founded while working at the Claremont University Consortium.</p>\n<p>Until last December, King specifically spent his time at UCSB engaging with A.S. senators and executives to aid them in their academic success.</p>\n<p>“Especially with regards to politics with such division, the one thing that everyone has in common is school. We’re all here for the same reason. You all are in school. So that’s going to be my thing,” King said.</p>\n<p>Although his time at UCSB was greatly appreciated, King made the decision to leave the university to pursue his passion and once again manage his academic advising services.</p>\n<p>“I’m so excited about it, I get to focus solely on my passion to work my noble purpose … to be able to solely focus on academic success. It’s like a breath of fresh air because I love this work.”</p>\n<p>Presently, King is the CEO of A+ For Excellence and Graduating Champions. While both services offer academic advising, Graduating Champions is catered to student athletes, like King himself, so they can better manage their time between sports and school.</p>\n<p>Although King is now pursuing his passions elsewhere, students like Gessesse find themselves reminiscing about their time with him.</p>\n<p>“I can’t envision what [students] will experience without him here, because that’s how much of an impact that he had … He was like my muse, my Pandora’s box to understanding my time here at UCSB,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p><em>Max Abrams is an asst. news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus <em>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or maxabrams@dailynexus.com.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 7, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
