In the final minutes Capparilli found the bottom left corner of the net off a recovery on a poor deflection from a Pittsburgh defender for the golden goal.</p>\n<p>“We wanted it more,” Capparilli said. “We were in better shape, our hearts were in it and we put the pressure on them as soon as the whistle blew.

The Gauchos beat Colorado State (2-0) and Missouri (2-1) in pool play, and won their first championship flight against Texas State (5-4) in penalty kicks after a scoreless 15 minute overtime period. After an impressive 9-3-1 season record and a 3-0 win against a local club national team, the men were knocked out by North Carolina 3-0 in the quarter final match.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43234\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/womens-club-brings-home-national-title/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43234\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/womens-club-brings-home-national-title/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/womens-club-brings-home-national-title/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/womens-club-brings-home-national-title/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/womens-club-brings-home-national-title/","id":1650,"author":{"id":306,"name":"Zak Weinberg"},"related":[1649,1648,1647],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Top Friars 3-2 in Second Round","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Three players tallied one goal and one assist apiece in an offensive effort that led UCSB men’s soccer past Providence College in second round action of the NCAA tournament Sunday night.

Just six minutes into the match, a through ball by Madueno was met with a powerful kick by Silva, giving UCSB the early 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>“It was ripped,” Vom Steeg said about Silva’s goal. “Silva was not only great but was on a different level on the field tonight.”</p>\n<p>Silva’s shot from 12 yards out added to his total of 17 goals on the year. At the end of Big West conference play, Silva ranked No. 6 in the nation in goals scored, and ranks No. 12 overall in goals per game with .80 as of Nov. 13.</p>\n<p>Madueno was able to add his name to the shot list at the 40:14 mark, when he received a pass on the left side of the box from sophomore forward Dom Sarle, who is currently second on the team in total assists with nine.</p>\n<p>“Josue was a real important key to the game tonight,” Vom Steeg said. “They couldn’t stay with his pace and athleticism.”</p>\n<p>Down 2-0 coming out of the halftime break, Providence was able to respond with a goal by freshman defender Brandon Adler 22 minutes into the second period. The goal came on a corner kick set and was Adler’s first of the year.</p>\n<p>“I made a curving run toward the back post and made a header,” Adler said. “One of their players tried to clear it off the line but thankfully it went over.”</p>\n<p>Less than five minutes later, Sarle was able to score on a through ball from Silva, who tallied his team-leading 10th assist of the year.</p>\n<p>“I beat [the defender] around the corner quick,” Sarle said. “He cheated near post and I slipped it by him.”</p>\n<p>Providence was able to draw a foul call within the box during the 83rd minute, allowing Anthony Baumann to deliver a penalty kick to the lower left side of the goal. The strike brought the Gaucho lead down to 3-2, where it would remain for the rest of the match.</p>\n<p>“We lost to a good team,” Providence Head Coach Chaka Daley said. “The way we played in the second half … we should have played that way in the first half.”</p>\n<p>UCSB out-shot the Friars 8-1 in the first half and 16-6 throughout the game. Providence goalkeeper Jhojan Obando recorded seven total saves during the match, and UCSB junior goalie Andre Grandt tallied two stops.</p>\n<p>UCSB advances to the third round of the tournament against Creighton next Sunday, Nov. 27.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43159\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43159\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-21/gauchos-top-friars-32/","id":1649,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1648,1647,1646],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Defeated by Creighton in Third Round of NCAA’s","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-11-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men's soccer team was defeated 2-1 in third round action of the NCAA tournament against Creighton in Omaha, Nebraska on Sunday.

Creighton attempted 17 shots overall, including twelve attempts in the first half that yielded two goals.</p>\n<p>Both of Creighton’s goals were scored on dead-ball plays, the first a penalty against junior forward Sam Garza within the box just seven minutes into the first half. Garza’s foul call was met with frustration from the UCSB sideline and allowed Creighton’s Bruno Castro to put the Blue Jays up 1-0 on the PK.</p>\n<p>“It was about the worst way to start a game,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We were very confused as to what the call even was. He had told Sam Garza not to hold [Creighton’s Ethan Finlay] and Sam said he was not holding him, but obviously referee saw differently.”</p>\n<p>A second goal came just ten minutes later when Andrew Ribeiro was able to connect on a corner kick play. Ribeiro’s low strike on the ground after a deflection was made amidst a swarm of blue and white jerseys, and crept past junior goalkeeper Andre Grandt to push the Blue Jay lead to 2-0, a margin that UCSB was unable to overcome.</p>\n<p>“It was really tough coming back from two goals down early on,” Sarle said. “We had a chance in the last ten minutes but it’s always tough going down two like that. Especially against Creighton who has only given up a handful of goals all year.”</p>\n<p>The game was physical throughout the 90-minute stretch. Questionable calls toward the end of regulation were met with furious reactions from the UCSB sideline, including the ejection of assistant coach Greg Curry with just over five minutes remaining in the game. The ejection came after Curry’s reaction toward a yellow-card call against senior midfielder Luis Silva that sent a Creighton player to the ground in front of the UCSB bench. Two yellow cards were issued to Creighton, while three were given to UCSB. The Gauchos also received two red cards, both with under five minutes remaining in the match.</p>\n<p>Grandt had arguably his best performance of the year with a season-high eight saves throughout the match. Opoku led all shooters with three shots. League-leading scorer Luis Silva was held to just two shot attempts, and none on goal.</p>\n<p>Silva finishes his collegiate career ranked fifth in the nation with 17 goals and third in the nation in total points with 44, which also ties him for No. 1 in UCSB history for points in a season.</p>\n<p>With the loss, UCSB’s 2011 campaign comes to an end.
