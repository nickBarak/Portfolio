I’ve felt that this is a match we would want to see again, so it’s exciting to get a replay with them at a neutral site,” Head Coach Simon Thibodeau said.</p>\n<p>This second look for the Gauchos at the talented UCLA squad seems to be as challenging as the time before, as UCSB will have to deal with the overall talent of the Bruin roster, which is comprised of standouts like Shibahara and Hart.</p>\n<p>Shibahara is currently ranked the No. 5 singles player in the nation, and the pair of Shibara and Hart is currently ranked No. 12 in the nation. Hart is also ranked in another Bruin doubles pair alongside junior Terri Fleming at No. 32.</p>\n<p>The Bruins third and final ranked pair headed into the matchup this weekend is No. 58 sophomores Gabby Andrews and Alaina Miller. The three ranked doubles teams and talented singles players on the Bruins roster are all challenges looking to prevent the Gauchos from progressing onto the second round of the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>If there was a time for Santa Barbara to come out with a hard-fought win against a tough team, it would be now.</p>\n<p>The team has not lost a match since its regular-season battle with Hawaii on March 30 and is now carrying the momentum of a perfect month of April, which saw the team win 10 consecutive matches and earn a second consecutive Big West Championship.</p>\n<p>The keys Gauchos behind this season’s impressive playoff push, such as juniors Palina Dubavets and Natalie Da Silveira and seniors Stefani Stojic, Melissa Baker and Jaimee Gilbertson, have all earned a variety of accolades for their efforts respectively.</p>\n<p>The Big West named Dubavets to the singles first team, and she also earned a spot on both the doubles first and second team rosters.</p>\n<p>Da Silveira and Gilbertson earned second team singles honors. Stojic was named to the doubles first team for her work as one half of the Dubavets/Stojic pair, and Baker was named to the doubles second team for her partnership with Dubavets as well. It is these players who the Gauchos are hoping will push the team to new heights in the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>“We have seven of the eight players returning from last year’s team, and everyone has seemed to gain experience and play better,” Thibodeau said. “We have a similar team, but with more experience, and now we’re playing a team that we know at a site closer to home, which has us feeling good about the match.”</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s tennis team will play the No. 23 UCLA Bruins on Friday, May 12, at 10 a.m. If UCSB advances, it will face either Pepperdine or LIU Brooklyn on Saturday, May 13 at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 4, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77783\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/rallying-gauchos-prepare-for-bruins-to-open-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77783\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/rallying-gauchos-prepare-for-bruins-to-open-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/rallying-gauchos-prepare-for-bruins-to-open-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/rallying-gauchos-prepare-for-bruins-to-open-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/rallying-gauchos-prepare-for-bruins-to-open-postseason/","id":1202,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1201,1200,1199],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez","biography":"Not available","articles":[45,52,64,67,68,69,71,1111,1132,1136,1160,1162,1165,1169,1170,1172,1197,1201,1202,1204,1205,1377,1380,1383,1388,1399,1497,1921,3342,4097,4106,4111,4266,4268,4270,4273,4274,4282,4287,4819,4822,4828,4889,4891,4892,4893],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Returning the Favor: The Reintroduction of UCSB Women’s Tennis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-10.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-10.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After winning its first NCAA Tournament match in program history last season, the UCSB women's tennis team entered its 2016-17 campaign even more determined to continue the ascension of the Gauchos re...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>At the end of March, the UCSB women’s tennis team had an overall record of 7-9.

It’s exciting to get back to NCAA play.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos needed to get back to the Big West Championship, and that is exactly what the team did.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77704\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-22_stephenmanga_wtennis-2-web/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77704\" data-attachment-id=\"77704\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/returning-the-favor-the-reintroduction-of-ucsb-womens-tennis/2017-04-22_stephenmanga_wtennis-2-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-77704\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web-1024x683.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-2-web.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77704\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jaimee Gilbertson returns a serve with a powerful backhand.<em> Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The squad beat rival Cal Poly 4-0 in the quarterfinals and then went on to beat perennial opponent Long Beach State 4-1, all to find themselves at the stage at which the team believed they were going to end up all season long.</p>\n<p>The only team in the way of the Gauchos moving on to the NCAA tournament was, you guessed it, the University of Hawaii. The Gauchos played an exciting match, with the clinching point coming from a singles victory by freshman Stephanie Yamada.</p>\n<p>The final victory in the month of April allowed the Gauchos to yet again raise the cup, a satisfaction surely made sweeter by beating the team that had been above them so often during the season. The Championship win also meant a perfect April for the UCSB women’s tennis team, as the team won all 10 games played, and they will surely carry that momentum into the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s tennis program has not always experienced this kind of success. Last year’s Big West Championship became the program’s first in 20 years. The team had fallen into mediocrity after winning the Big West Championship six consecutive years from 1991-1996.</p>\n<p>The work toward obtaining the accolades UCSB has earned over the past couple of seasons can be traced back to five years ago, when longtime Fresno State Head Coach Simon Thibodeau was brought to Santa Barbara to lead the program.</p>\n<p>“Well, it was difficult to leave Fresno State, where we had a lot of success, and I was really trying to bring UCSB to the same level. I felt the school had even more potential due to the location and academic rank of this school,” Thibodeau said.</p>\n<p>For the first three seasons of Thibodeau’s career, the team went 39-34, during which it was bounced out of the tournament every single season; the conference final was its highest mark yet.</p>\n<p>However, it was in this period of time when Thibodeau began to recruit players who would grow to be important pieces of the current winning formula at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Melissa Baker and Jaimee Gilbertson were added in 2013 and Natalie Da Silveira became a Gaucho in 2014. The 2015 additions to the squad included Amanda Atanasson, Palina Dubavets, Stefani Stojic and Yamada.</p>\n<p>“We also had a donor who boosted our scholarship amount, so we were able to go get a few more players like Palina, Amanda and Stefani Stojic, who are all transfers, and we gained some budget in their scholarship, so I was able to get more top players and I was able to compete at the highest level.”</p>\n<p>All of these players have been critical to UCSB’s rise to the top of the Big West Conference, and Thibodeau credits an increase in funding from UCSB donors as the primary reason the women’s tennis program is able to acquire highly talented transfers such as Dubavets and Stojic.</p>\n<p>“We really try to make this program the full package for any prospect in the world that wants to go study in the U.S. and play tennis. We’re getting closer; we would like to build more facilities in the future, but that’s the next step in terms of fundraising.”</p>\n<p>The current tennis roster boasts seven international players out of the current 12 roster spots, a sign of the increased ability of the program to attract better prospects.</p>\n<p>“Most of the best teams in the tournament are all fully funded in their scholarships. They have the NCAA limitation of eight full in/out of state scholarships for their players. That was not the case here when I took the program, and we really needed to fundraise to get to the amount that most of the big programs have.”</p>\n<p>Headed into the NCAA tournament, the Gauchos are looking to see how they will measure up to this top-25 talent showcased throughout the NCAA tournament and are hoping that the increased experience coming off of last year’s tournament exit will propel them farther than the second round.</p>\n<p>“We feel that we are just one player away from being able to compete with the top 16 teams in the country, and we hope to be at that level in the years to come.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 11, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

It also earned its fourth regular season title with Head Coach Marty Davis at the helm.</p>\n<p>Dating back to April 11, 2015, UCSB has extended its win streak against Big West opponents to 11 straight victories in the regular season.  Including the past two conference tournaments, Santa Barbara holds a 16-match win streak against its Big West counterparts.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has been in outstanding form as of late; its last meet loss was way back on March 13 against No. 4 Texas Christian University.</p>\n<p>After their victory over the current No. 50 Cal Poly, the Gauchos are currently No. 40 in the nation according to Intercollegiate Tennis Association rankings.</p>\n<p>The duo sensation of Gaucho junior Simon Freund and senior Morgan Mays maintains a No. 30 doubles ranking as well, moving down one spot from No. 29.</p>\n<p>“This match [against Cal Poly] was actually bigger than the western conference regular season title,” Davis said. “We think it’s going to leave us far enough in the rankings where our RPI should get us into that large [NCAA selection] bid, regardless of the result at Indian Wells.”</p>\n<p>Coach Davis is referring to a spot for the Gauchos in the NCAA 2017 Division I men’s tennis tournament. That, of course, won’t occur until after the Big West Tournament and is set for some time around the middle of May.</p>\n<p>There’s much to know as UCSB enters the Big West Tournament in fine form, as well as with many historical accolades.</p>\n<p>The men’s tennis team will be competing for its third consecutive conference title. The Gauchos have previously won the Big West Tournament championships a total of 10 times program history.</p>\n<p>They have won 7 of the last 11 tournaments at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden, which will once again be this year’s competition venue.</p>\n<p>Last year’s Big West championship concluded with a No. 1 and No. 2 seed finals matchup that had Santa Barbara face off against rival Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>The meet resulted in a 4-1 score and featured the familiar competitors of sophomore doubles pair Nicolas Moreno de Alboran/Anders Holm, junior Cody Rakela, senior Morgan Mays and senior Teague Hamilton, as well as Cal Poly’s No. 61 duo of seniors Corey Pang and Ben Donovan.</p>\n<p>Previewing Friday’s potential competitors, UCSB will meet against the winner of Wednesday’s No. 4- versus No. 5-seeded match of UC Irvine and the University of Hawaii.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s dominance of both programs has been well established over the years.</p>\n<p>It last lost to UC Irvine during the 2014-15 season and fell to Hawaii during its 2012-13 campaign. Due to rain, the matchup between UCSB and Hawaii was canceled during the 2013-14 season.</p>\n<p>Irvine ended its season with a 5-2 loss to No. 2-seed UC Davis and concluded its 2017 regular season at 8-14. The Anteaters also managed a fourth-place conference ranking following a 2-4 finish.</p>\n<p>UCSB previously defeated UC Irvine 5-2 on April 15 while on the road.</p>\n<p>As for Hawaii, the Gauchos opened up their season with an away doubleheader against the Rainbow Warriors, which resulted in a 7-0 sweep. They ended the season last in the Big West Conference standings at 1-4 and also finished their regular season with a meager 2-14 overall record.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face off against the winner of the No. 4/5 seed match, either UC Irvine or the University of Hawaii, this Friday, April 28 at 3 p.m. at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 27, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77350\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/mens-tennis-in-search-of-three-peat-heading-into-the-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77350\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/mens-tennis-in-search-of-three-peat-heading-into-the-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/mens-tennis-in-search-of-three-peat-heading-into-the-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/mens-tennis-in-search-of-three-peat-heading-into-the-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/mens-tennis-in-search-of-three-peat-heading-into-the-big-west-tournament/","id":1200,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1199,1198,1197],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Tennis Completes Three-Peat, Fourth Big West Title in Five Years","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2017.04.22_StephenManga_MTennis-17.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2017.04.22_StephenManga_MTennis-17.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB took home the Big West conference title following a win in the championship game against rival Cal Poly by a 4-1 result.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s tennis team continues their win streak into the postseason.

Santa Barbara arrived at Indian Wells Tennis Garden last Thursday for their semifinal match against UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>The doubles portion was more closely fought than the Gauchos would have like. Nevertheless, UCSB won on every doubles court; thanks to Morgan Mays / Simon Freund on court 1 (7-5), Nicolas Moreno / Anders Holm on court 2 (6-4), and Cody Rakela / Kristian Prior on court 3 (6-6).</p>\n<p>The singles portion of Thursday’s meet was where the Gauchos finally found their form, as they lead 1-0 with the doubles advantage point. First to finish was Holm on court 4, whom bested UCI’s Mason Hansen after a pair of 6-2 victories.</p>\n<p>Next was Rakela vs. Bruce Man-Son-Hing on court 5, which ended in Santa Barbara’s favor at 6-1 / 6-2. Then, the deciding match took place on court 3 where Freund almost swept Luis Lopez by a score of 6-0 / 6-1. Ultimately, this gave UCSB the three remaining points necessary to take home the early 4-0 win on the day; thus granting them a Big West Championship spot on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly defeated second seed UC Davis that same Thursday after a hard fought 4-2 win, therefore earning themselves a visit with UCSB for the second year in a row.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s finals meet almost mirrored the same intensity as these teams’ regular season bout. The day began with the doubles portion, per usual, as court 3 first went in favor of Mustangs Auproux and Damiens by a score of 6-4. UCSB then responded on court 2 with a 6-2 victory by Moreno and Holm.</p>\n<p>Finally, the deciding doubles match was an exciting nail biter on court 1 where Freund / Mays met against Pang / Donovan for perhaps their most important sets of the season. It was a tough competition to watch, but UCSB eventually prevailed by a close victory of 7-6 (3).</p>\n<p>Currently with the doubles advantage point and early 1-0 lead, the Gauchos were just 3 wins away from earning the title through singles play. Cal Poly’s Corey Pang made a quick statement on court 1 with a pair of 6-4 victories, bringing his team back into the meet at a 1-all score.</p>\n<p>Then Holm matched this result with a pair of 6-4’s for himself on court 4. Once again, Freund extended the Gauchos’ lead after a tough 7-6 (6) score, then a 6-0 sweep, on court 3.</p>\n<p>Now, with the meet at 3-1 and in favor of Santa Barbara, the next court to finish would be able to decide the tournament. On court 2, Nicolas Moreno faced off against Ben Donovan as the two battled it out for a three setter.</p>\n<p>Moreno took the first with a smooth 6-0 sweep, but then Donovan clawed back into it with a 6-4 of his own. Then, Moreno earned not only another victory for his team, but the last point necessary to crown UCSB as champions in the Big West conference.</p>\n<p>Upon the meet’s conclusion, the ceremony commenced as the Gauchos celebrated a three-peat championship performance. Including the second year in a row in which Santa Barbara topples their rival Cal Poly, in the finals, by a score of 4-1.</p>\n<p>Following last weekend’s results, UCSB’s ITA rankings continue to grow as they are currently hoping for a participant spot in this year’s NCAA Men’s Tennis Tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will take a short break as they await a tournament at-large bid from the selection committee.
