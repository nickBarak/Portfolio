He grew increasingly politically active in 2005 and in 2008 ran against Putin in the Russian Presidential race. Kasparov shared about his experience as a political activist and why he thinks Putin is a global threat.</p>\n<p>Kasparov said when he began winning chess games, he realized he had a sense of responsibility to his country as a champion to address the political changes in Russia.</p>\n<p>“Winning the championship, I had some kind of responsibility,” Kasparov said. “I had to demonstrate to people that when Kasparov won, there was going to be change.”</p>\n<p>Kasparov said he does not know what the future holds for the power struggles between Putin and the free world, but Putin will be focused on remaining in power as democracies attempt to compromise with him.</p>\n<p>“Putin thinks about survival,” Kasparov said. “The free world is searching so desperately for common ground, democracies are slow to respond and they need strategy.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>[Putin’s] interest is in the opposition of the free world. He can’t afford stability because then he has to compete — he’s a loser.<br>\n<em>– Garry Kasparov</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Kasparov said he was disappointed with how President George H.W. Bush and President Obama intervened in Russian politics and said Putin has benefited from their “inadequate approaches.”</p>\n<p>“Bush did too much, Obama has done nothing,” Kasparov said. “They always believe the Soviet Union after the Cold War could have been better. [Putin] could benefit from that general belief of working together.”</p>\n<p>Kasparov said he believes Putin is uninterested in finding common ground with the free world because he knows he will be unable to compete with it.</p>\n<p>“[Putin’s] interest is in the opposition of the free world,” Kasparov said. “He can’t afford stability because then he has to compete — he’s a loser.”</p>\n<p>Kasparov said he rejects the idea that Putin’s strategy is like a game of chess. According to Kasparov, chess is a game of rules and Putin does not abide by rules.</p>\n<p>“Putin is not playing chess because it’s a transparent game,” Kasparov said. “He plays a different game because he can win by bluffing. He can win by bluffing and blackmail.”</p>\n<p>Kasparov said Putin can be “defeated” when Russian citizens believe he is no longer powerful.</p>\n<p>“Putin must demonstrate that he is no longer invincible,” Kasparov said. “The system must look weak in the eyes of his subjects. It’s all about political will that is so far not here. Putin is indispensible because everyone thinks he’s indispensable.”</p>\n<p>Kasparov said about “30 percent” of his life is now dedicated to chess, and he enjoys it because it possesses the rules that politics lack.</p>\n<p>“It helps keep my brain in good shape,” Kasparov said. “Chess has rules. I feel more confident when I play by the rules.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year history major Audrey Dalton said the most notable topic from the lecture was the idea that “dictators need enemies.”</p>\n<p>“I feel that sums up a lot of what [Kasparov] said. That’s why Putin is going to keep persecuting and starting wars in other places because he needs to justify his existence,” Dalton said. “Kasparov clearly has an informed opinion.”</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Diana Hernandez said she was interested in learning more about Putin to understand Kasparov’s actions.</p>\n<p>“I had a basic overview, but I don’t know that much about it, so that’s why I wanted to come,” Hernandez said. “I want to know the details of Kasparov’s decision, what he stands for and why is he against Putin.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year German and economics double-major Michael Göpper said he is interested in Russian politics because of Germany’s geographical proximity to Russia.</p>\n<p>“About the topic of Russian politics, I think I know quite a lot from reading German newspaper, because Russia’s not too far away from Germany or Europe in general,” Göpper said. “I’m really interested in Russian politics and Russian foreign relations and the issues that are involved in that.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Upon arrival, deputies were flagged down by a nearby witness who stated the male subject, later identified as UCSB student Andres “Andy” Esteban Sanchez, had a deep laceration on his right arm. When deputies first made contact with Esteban Sanchez, he was being held down by three people. One deputy removed the blanket wrapped around Esteban Sanchez’s wound and revealed a cut approximately three-quarter inches in diameter around his arm. The deputy reapplied the blanket and attempted to restrain Esteban Sanchez. Medics arrived, secured Esteban Sanchez and transported him to SB Cottage Hospital.</p>\n<p>Esteban Sanchez’s roommate said he had seen the victim earlier in the evening when he rushed into their apartment talking gibberish. One of the reporting officers visited the address, where the subject had punched through a window and cut his arm on the glass.</p>\n<p>The deputy contacted SB Cottage Hospital and provided Esteban Sanchez’s personal information. Hospital staff advised Esteban Sanchez was in surgery and may not survive. At approximately 6:51 a.m., SB Cottage Hospital staff reported Esteban Sanchez had died as a result of blood loss. The Goleta Patrol Bureau is currently handling the coroner’s report.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article stated Sanchez passed away at approximately 6:58 a.m.; however, the time of

the group’s marginalization. <em>Courtesy of Facebook</em></p></div>\n<p>La Familia de Colores will host a “Transgender Day of Remembrance” on Friday in honor of Zoraida Reyes, a trans Latina activist and UC Santa Barbara student who was murdered in 2014.</p>\n<p>Reyes was a co-founder of La Familia de Colores at UCSB, an organization that seeks to provide a safe space for LGTBQ Latin@/Chican@ and people of color. While Reyes was unable to attain her degree in Chican@ Studies due to financial reasons, the graduating Class of 2015 presented it to her posthumously. Friday’s event was planned to honor those who identify as trans and have been victims of violence of hate crimes, as well as those who have fought for justice and equality for the transgender community.</p>\n<p>Director of UCSB’s Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity David Whitman said violence towards the trans community is a symptom of the group’s marginalization in daily life.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully the trans day of remembrance at UCSB can humble students to realize that oftentimes, by just being who you are, you are at risk for losing your life,” Whitman said.</p>\n<p>Whitman said the event will honor the memory of individuals who have fought against oppression.</p>\n<p>“For us to do this, it is to show that yes, number one, they matter, and number two, this is an injustice,” Whitman said.</p>\n<p>According to Whitman, events like the one taking place Friday are infrequent either because they are not widely publicized in the media or individuals are unaware of the violence trans people face.</p>\n<p>“This is something to care about, that this is an issue in our country, in our world, and hopefully [attendees] would at least be considering more, how they can be thoughtful, helpful, supportive and more loving,” Whitman said.</p>\n<p>Whitman said it is important to honor Zoraida because of her role in helping found La Familia de Colores, the only LGBTQ Chican@ organization on campus.</p>\n<p>“She created this space for people that identify in this intersection and they are feeling rightfully that it is their duty to always honor not just the founder of their group that continues to be a supportive place for Queer Chican@, trans-identified people, but also to highlight the broader issue of violence happening to trans people of color,” Whitman said.</p>\n<p>First-year psychology major Adriana Pedroza said she was inspired to advocate for marginalized groups when she attended the Trans Revolution talk featuring trans-activist Jennicet Gutierrez in November.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people don’t know about the transgender community and [that] having a day to support them allows the UCSB community to stand in solidarity and honor those who have been oppressed just for being themselves,” Pedroza said.</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Sabrina Delgado said there needs to be more leaders in the UCSB community to spread awareness about the violence trans people face.</p>\n<p>“I think the people who don’t talk about this group are not educated or are unaware of the struggles transgender people face, so attending this event on Friday to learn more about the transgender community is a way of showing that you care,” Delgado said.</p>\n<p>First-year sociology major Juan Villalobos said honoring those affected by transgender violence validates their struggle.</p>\n<p>“People still have the mentality that it’s a choice if you identify within a LGBTQ group, and it’s kind of sad that others aren’t aware of the discrimination they deal with,” Villalobos said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of the Thursday, November 19, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
