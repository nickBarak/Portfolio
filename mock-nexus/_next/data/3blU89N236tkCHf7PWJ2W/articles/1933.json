Psychedelic Club’s overarching mission is to “increase mainstream cultural awareness and acceptance of psychedelics,” according to a statement from its </span><a href=\"https://www.psychedeliclub.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“On the very basic level, we want to be a safe space for people to come and talk about whatever interest they have in it. Bad or positive experiences, life-changing experiences. We want them to be able to connect with people about [psychedelics] and learn,” Kerrigan, a fourth-year biopsychology major, said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of us are biopsychology majors; we know how [psychedelics] work on your brain and how it affects your body. We want to actually inform people on that and actually talk about research.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychedelic Club of UCSB is the first branch of Psychedelic Club in California and the 10th in the nation, with other branches located in Colorado, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, North Carolina, Virginia, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Maine, according to its website.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gworek first became aware of Psychedelic Club while browsing research on the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (M.A.P.S.) website, stumbling upon a link to the organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She then reached out to Clayton Ickes, the vice president of Psychedelic Club at CU Boulder, and began discussions to establish a branch of Psychedelic Club at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, Gworek was starting to have conversations with other UCSB students surrounding their shared interest in psychedelics research. Over the summer, Gworek communicated with Santhanam over text, although they didn’t meet in person until the beginning of this school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two were intrigued by historical research into psychedelics, as well as the growing acceptance of psychedelics in present-day psychological research.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[We] see all this valid research — although most of it was done in the ‘60s before the giant ban on drugs,” Santhanam, a third-year psychological and brain sciences major, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There were these incredible findings with people with terminal illnesses. Psychedelics had this capacity to help people accept death or change their attitudes toward death, which I think is phenomenal.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research also indicated that psychedelics were effective in managing disorders like anxiety and depression and even had a degree of effectiveness when other medications weren’t working, according to Santhanam. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only recently have institutions began to address the subject of psychedelics on a large scale, Gworek said. In September, Johns Hopkins University opened a center for psychedelic research: The Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research. Funded with $17 million from private donors, it is the first research institution of its kind in the United States and the largest of its kind in the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“John Hopkins has opened their research center for psychedelics, which is amazing. I would love to be a part of that and get more labs open to that, although definitely something that needs to happen now is that [psychedelics research] needs to be more structured and have more direction,” Kerrigan said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santhanam, Gworek and Kerrigan were also interested in how the everyday person could benefit from psychedelics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Psychedelics can allow even your average person to get new perspectives on life and it allows people to be really introspective and remind you how important it is to be present and intentional with the things that you do,” Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When a psychedelic is metabolizing the serotonin receptor, it seems to fire much faster and also can make parts of your brain interact that don’t normally communicate,” Santhanam added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Santhanam, psychedelics allow one to reexamine aspects of their life in manners which are difficult to perform without psychedelics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gworek, Santhanam and Kerrigan intend to use the club as a platform to inform people of the benefits and drawbacks to using psychedelics, as well as dispel common misconceptions regarding psychedelics and how they compare to other drugs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Psychedelics are not the go-to drugs for most people. You’d be surprised by how many people may have heard about it but don’t even know what a psychedelic is,” Santhanam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the near future, Psychedelic Club would like to bring speakers and advocacy organizations to campus, such as EntheoMedicine, as well as host risk management events in the style of The Zendo Project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The EntheoMedicine people are the people that kind of guide you through your trip and they host events in other countries where it’s legal, and they’re kind of guides when you’re on it. They said they’d be interested, and that they really want to talk to young people, Kerrigan said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Zendo Project is a program associated with M.A.P.S., which provides psychedelic harm reduction to those at festivals, concerts and other events where psychedelic substances may be used. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you’re at a festival and you’re using psychedelics and things get weird and you’re uncomfortable and you’re anxious and you’re overwhelmed because you’re surrounded by thousands of people and pounding music, they provide a safe space where you can go,” Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They have therapists who are trained to deal with people having a difficult psychedelic experience.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gworek plans to host a psychedelic harm reduction event in the same vein to teach people about risk management, how to best navigate bad trips and, beyond that, what to learn from difficult trips.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If something goes wrong like that, that’s an anxiety that a lot of people have about using psychedelics. It’d be nice to educate people on how to best handle those kinds of situations,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But above all else, the priority of Psychedelic Club is to start the conversation about psychedelic use. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m hoping the club will just be a place where people who are interested in psychedelics or psychedelic research or just the psychedelic experience in general … can just kind of congregate and have those discussions,” Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the Oct. 31, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

CSD) meeting. The updated budget still features many of the original proposal’s designs, such as the beer garden and the music stages; however, cuts were still made to several areas to reduce the event’s overall cost, including having less fencing and fewer portable toilets, information kiosks and targeted Facebook advertisements. The updated budget also cut the number of giveaways in half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Isla-Vista-April-2020-Event-Production-Budget-Reduction-Budget-159K.pdf\">new proposal</a> further removes one of the music stages, a reduction of $7,000, that could potentially be brought back with a sponsorship — something that UC Santa Barbara’s Associated Students (A.S.) could potentially fulfill, according to I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud presented a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Isla-Vista-April-2020-Event-Production-Budget-Sheet3.pdf\">variety of options</a> to enable the board to fund the event during Tuesday’s meeting, including asking UC Santa Barbara to fund the street </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/evpla-publishes-proposal-for-lighting-expansion-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lighting project</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well as drawing money from different sources in the I.V. CSD budget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the reductions, some board members still expressed concern over the lack of official partners and sponsorships to help cover the cost of the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of last Tuesday’s meeting, no other entity has agreed to fund the festival. However, Board President Spencer Brandt named UCSB, A.S., Santa Barbara City College, the Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District, the city of Goleta and local businesses as current potential sponsors for the festival. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At the number that we have in front of us with no else at the table with us, I’m not comfortable using our revenue for it, in the full amount,” Director Ethan Bertrand said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Kristie Nguyen agreed with Bertrand’s concerns and suggested scaling down the size and cost of the event to gauge the community’s response, and afterward, determine if the festival was a success and warrants a greater investment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we find out if [the spring festival] is going to be successful, then we can start funding more money. But as of right now, we don’t know the success rate, and we won’t know until it actually happens,” Nguyen said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity has also shouldered a portion of its festival budget under Operating Expenses but stressed that the Safety and Security portion is “NOT THE PLACE TO CUT” in the budget, as stated in the proposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have been continuously telling people that the reason why we want to do this is not because we want Deltopia to be shut down.

However, the office does keep copies of the allegations on file, even if the student isn’t punished following a first infraction, according to the warning emails sent to students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve never tried to get an ID in the past, but I’m on Free and For Sale and I see the posts all the time and I know it’s a common thing people do,” said a fourth-year anthropology major, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The student posted on the Free and For Sale page looking for an extra ID so their younger sister, who is not a UCSB student, could attend Delirium. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After posting on the Facebook page, a warning email from the Office of Student Conduct appeared in the student’s inbox. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t even think about it being an issue because everyone’s been doing it for so long. It’s something that I see around this time of year every single year, for all the concerts,” the student added. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB does not go through the Free &amp; For Sale page looking for offenders, according to Armistead. Instead, she said the university receives reports and screenshots of student ID sales from other individuals, often students, who use the page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The people who run the Facebook group used to take down and report posts about ID sales, but due to the sheer volume of posts, they are simply unable to keep up with all of them, according to the page’s administrator, Dayllan Maar.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If the university really cares that much about it, they’re more than welcome to look through the page and find everyone who’s violating the rules,” Maar said. “If the university doesn’t view it to be that important of a rule, I don’t know why I should enforce a rule the university doesn’t want to enforce.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University administrators, police officers and members of Associated Students are all members of the Facebook page, meaning that they can see when students make posts about ID sales, according to Maar. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maar said he suspects UCSB is cracking down on the posts now due to the page’s growing user base, which had 20,000 members when he became a moderator in 2017, but has doubled to over 40,000 members in the last two years. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead’s assertion that the presence of non-students at student-only events opens the door to safety concerns was backed up by Student Advocate General Andrew Nguyen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What is most dangerous is when people outside of Isla Vista and the UCSB community come to Isla Vista and UCSB and they pose a potential danger to our community because they’re not from this community,” Nguyen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They have no stake in this community, there’s no personal ties.
