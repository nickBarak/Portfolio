style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former UCSB student Daniel J. Chen was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/former-student-arrested-in-2014-campus-rape-case/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arrested</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in San Ramon on Feb. 10, 2016 and charged with two counts of rape and is currently being held without bail in the Santa Barbara County Jail awaiting trial. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the lawsuit, the UC Regents motioned to strike four specific portions of its text, saying the allegations were not valid enough to carry out legal action.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Santa Barbara Superior Court Judge Donna Geck on June 28 overruled the Regent’s challenge with </span><a href=\"http://www.sbcourts.org/os/tr/tentative-detail.php?RuleID=48964\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">support</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for each of the plaintiff’s allegations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among four claims, the Regents said the lawsuit did not explain how the foliage-covered area created a “forseeable risk” for the plaintiff’s injuries. The lawsuit, however, alleges that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the university had “previously received several complaints that crimes had occurred in this area.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These are more than sufficient allegations to support the inference that it was foreseeable that a student walking in the area, particularly a female student, might be the victim of a sexual assault or other criminal activity,” the court ruled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents also argued that the plaintiff failed to explain how the area was dangerous and describe how the “dangerous condition” led to the plaintiff’s injuries. The court rejected both of the arguments and the the lawsuit will proceed in its original form. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents had approximately 10 days to respond to the court’s ruling, and the plaintiff and defendant will now begin negotiating whether the case will go to trial or end with a settlement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tyrone Maho, an attorney representing the plantiff, said the woman is still hoping for a settlement in the case.</span></p>\n<p>“She wants accountability, not just by the people that did this to her, but for the university to allow this dangerous condition to exist,” he said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attorneys representing both parties will hold the next status conference on Sept. 16.

The remaining 97 votes went toward other Democratic and third-party candidates.</p>\n<p>Nearly 90 percent of voters chose to support Democratic candidates at the polls. Abboud said Sanders’s strong lead was likely due to support from the Sanders campaign support throughout campus and I.V.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t just that people wanted to vote for Bernie, but Bernie helped get people politically aware,” Abboud said. “A lot of the people we talked to knew about the issues very early on, so it was a good year.”</p>\n<p>The voter turnout among UCSB students and I.V. residents is even more astonishing because the primary election was held on last week of the quarter, when most students were completing final exams.</p>\n<p>“The numbers … show the level of organization and volunteer efforts here for the primary were extremely higher than average,” Abboud said. “The whole campaign was centered around driving turnout, because the primary was during finals week.”</p>\n<p>Abboud also noted that UCSB and I.V. voters will be especially important to the general election in November because of specific ballot measures, such as a marijuana legalization bill and the vote for I.V. to become a Community Services District (CSD).</p>\n<p>“The Isla Vista Community Services District election is in November and that is the most direct thing anyone could ever vote on to make Isla Vista a better place,” Abboud said. “So we believe that the excitement and the promise of CSD plus the importance of all the other races of elected office and the wide array of propositions on the ballot will be driving factors for people to vote.”</p>\n<p>Voters in Santa Barbara also selected candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the state senate, assembly and the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors. Final results will be determined after the general election on Nov. 8.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, June 23, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: A previous version of this story said Clinton had won the Democratic presidential nomination, she has not yet secured the nomination.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71753\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-22/ucsb-sees-large-voter-turnout-despite-finals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71753\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-22/ucsb-sees-large-voter-turnout-despite-finals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-22/ucsb-sees-large-voter-turnout-despite-finals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-22/ucsb-sees-large-voter-turnout-despite-finals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-22/ucsb-sees-large-voter-turnout-despite-finals/","id":2467,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2466,2465,2464],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Vagina Monologues & Herstories To Bring Excitement, Discomfort, Inclusion","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Vagina-Monologues_for-02.09_Alex-Gonzalez-3-4-of-1-e1392025457993.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Vagina-Monologues_for-02.09_Alex-Gonzalez-3-4-of-1-e1392025457993.jpg?resize=600%2C384&ssl=1","description":"Students who were taken aback by animate vaginas wandering through The Arbor can expect tears, laughter and storytelling from the Women’s Ensemble Theatre Troupe this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who were taken aback by animate vaginas wandering through the Arbor can expect tears, laughter and storytelling from the Women’s Ensemble Theatre Troupe this weekend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group will present The Vagina Monologues &amp; Herstories on Friday at 7:30 p.m. and Saturday at 2 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. to explore the realm of “BDSM, immigration, the gaming industry for women and so much more” according to Bridget Kyeremateng, director and fourth-year black studies and feminist studies double major.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Vagina Monologues &amp; Herstories at UCSB offers an insightful look into the feminine experience. All proceeds from the event will be donated to the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unique to UCSB is the inclusion of herstories, a storytelling portion built on students’ experiences. According to Kyeremateng, UCSB may discontinue The Vagina Monologues  in coming years to focus solely on Herstories. Herstories involves first-hand prose written by students, creating an even stronger bond with the campus and community. The portion will be directed by Rachel Gregory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Kyeremateng’s key influences on the production has been the addition of diversity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The feminist movement is rising, and Herstories brings up a more diverse cast that The Vagina Monologues tend to not have,” Kyeremateng, who is a veteran of the production, said. “Looking back, the troupe was not as diverse as it could have been.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The show stresses the importance of representation, she said, with this year’s cast including a bigender member for the first time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While The Vagina Monologues alone are wonderfully informative, Kyeremateng said the name can exclude certain experiences; for example, someone who identifies as a woman may not be able to participate in childbirth, thus excluding LGBTQ+ identities. Kyeremateng is also performing her own prose piece this year on being an undocumented black woman in the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophie Swezey, an actress working on the monologue “The Vagina Workshop” said her piece is about a middle-aged woman who goes to a “vagina workshop” to learn more about her vagina and how to make herself orgasm. She goes through a transformational experience</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> finds her clitoris and ultimately learns how to make herself orgasm.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We live in a society that tends to discourage women from exploring themselves, touching themselves, and talking about their vaginas,” she said in an email. “I think in essence that’s the most powerful part of The Vagina monologues — that women are talking about their experiences and discussing ‘taboo topics.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While never having had this woman’s exact experience, Swezey identifies with her character in terms of self-confidence and comfort with one’s body, issues many women face.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Vagina Monologues intend to be a uniting and empowering show for women, but Kyeremateng said, “It’s not exclusive to just women; in order for the feminist movement to work, we need to get our allies involved.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those who are uncomfortable attending an event where women openly discuss vaginas, actress Rose Houska said, “It’s okay to be uncomfortable. These are things we are not ‘supposed’ to talk about, so naturally it’s [going to] be uncomfortable.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tickets can be found online <a href=\"https://events.ucsb.edu/org/os/wett\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, at the A.S.
