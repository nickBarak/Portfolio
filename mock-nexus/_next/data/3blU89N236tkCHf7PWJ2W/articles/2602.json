But each year the holiday season brings a much more severe disappointment to children around the world: the realization that Santa Claus isn’t real.</p>\n<p>We all have our own story of discovery, and the <em>Nexus </em>asked five UC Santa Barbara students to share the moment they discovered the magical man was, in fact, a legend.</p>\n<p>First-year biology major Sam Lewis said he was sick and home from school one day when his mom sat him down, holding an article about Saint Nicholas to show he was real at some point.</p>\n<p>“Then she said, ‘Even though [Santa Claus] is gone, his spirit still lives on through Christmas, and now you’re part of the knowing club because Santa Claus doesn’t really exist — we’re Santa Claus,’” Lewis said. “‘Your brother isn’t part of the club, so don’t tell him. When he’s about your age, we’ll tell him as well.’ And so for the next couple of years, I was in the know and I thought I was in this cool, exclusive club.”</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Varshini Satish said she was eager to catch Santa Claus one year with her dad. The two of them camped out by the fireplace on Christmas Eve with baseball bats and a garbage bag to catch Santa.</p>\n<p>“I tried to stay awake as long as I could, but I eventually fell asleep,” Satish said. “At some point I woke up when I heard a movement. My dad told me he had gone to get a glass of water, but I saw presents under the tree and I looked at the handwriting on them and it all clicked in my brain.”</p>\n<p>First-year undeclared major Camila Holm’s parents were not ready to tell her the truth about Santa Claus when her aunt spoiled the secret one year.</p>\n<p>“My mom always had special wrapping paper and special tags for Santa to use and then when my aunt came to visit, she mixed them up,” Holm said. “So then Santa and my aunt had the same wrapping paper and when I asked my mom about it, I found out.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Travis Kim discovered the sad reality when he supposedly misread the calendar one year.</p>\n<p>“Santa came on [December] 24th . . . I asked my mom why and she said, ‘Everyone makes mistakes — even Santa,’” Kim said. “But Santa never makes mistakes . . . that’s when I knew.”</p>\n<p>For some, like first-year biology major Sunaina Kongara, the illusion of Santa Claus and his reindeer never existed.</p>\n<p>“I never believed in Santa because my dad was too lazy,” Kongara said. “He wouldn’t even wait until we fell asleep to put presents under the tree or eat all the cookies.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 in the Thursday, Dec. 3 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

Sweater Party in the Loma Pelona Center on Monday, encouraging the spirit of the holidays with an ugly sweater contest, cookie decorating, snacks, festive music and a photo booth.</p>\n<p>The Ugly Sweater Party took place after the first day of instruction following Thanksgiving break, and on the official commencement day of “Dead Week.” R.A. of the Zaca house and second-year biochemistry major Mitine and R.A. of the Camuesa house and third-year sociology and psychology double-major Aranki invited students to don holiday attire and relax before finals.</p>\n<p>Mitine said she enjoyed watching friends gather together in Loma Pelona and decorate cookies from an ugly sweater cookie kit.</p>\n<p>“It makes you feel like you’re in kindergarten,” Mitine said. “You’re decorating cookies and people are talking and getting to know each other.”</p>\n<p>Mitine said she is excited for Christmas break because she wants to spend time with friends and family and enjoy her first Christmas in Hawaii. Mitine said organizing the event was fun because she loves Christmas and the winter season.</p>\n<p>“Decorating was fun,” Mitine said. “The holiday times are my favorite, so doing a program like this was not a problem.”</p>\n<p>Third-year biology major Yaneli Gutierrez said her favorite part of the party was decorating cookies, which she modeled after her reindeer sweater. Gutierrez also said she attended the party because she enjoys Christmas and ugly sweaters.</p>\n<p>“The tackier the better,” Gutierrez said.</p>\n<p>Aranki said she wanted to host a fun holiday party as a “de-stresser” for her residents.</p>\n<p>“I really care about residents a lot, especially their mental well-being,” Aranki said.</p>\n<p>Mitine said she hoped the event would be a fun way to bring the residents together.</p>\n<p>“Everyone always talks about how they miss being home for the holidays,” Mitine said. “Dead Week and finals are so stressful.”</p>\n<p>Mitine said the Loma Pelona Center was chosen for the event because it is between Manzanita and San Rafael residence halls and facilitates opportunities to meet other students.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s just a nice way to get people out of their room or away from the library for a little bit and to all be out here together,” Mitine said.</p>\n<p>Third year biology major Heidi Lee said Christmas is one of her favorite holidays because she gets to spend time with friends and family.</p>\n<p>“I want to skip over finals and get to break,” Lee said.</p>\n<p>International student from Belgium Annelies Leenknecht said she is currently taking classes at Santa Barbara City College on a gap year.</p>\n<p>Leenknecht said she enjoyed attending the party in preparation for winter break, although she wishes she was returning to Santa Barbara in January.</p>\n<p>“I wish I could come back here afterwards,” Leenknecht said. “I have to stay home unfortunately.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66885\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/resident-assistants-host-ugly-sweater-party-to-celebrate-upcoming-holidays/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66885\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/resident-assistants-host-ugly-sweater-party-to-celebrate-upcoming-holidays/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/resident-assistants-host-ugly-sweater-party-to-celebrate-upcoming-holidays/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/resident-assistants-host-ugly-sweater-party-to-celebrate-upcoming-holidays/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/resident-assistants-host-ugly-sweater-party-to-celebrate-upcoming-holidays/","id":2600,"author":{"id":138,"name":"Selina Alvarez"},"related":[2599,2598,2597],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Professor Rios Lectures On Justice, Race","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rios_by-Alex-Nagase-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rios_by-Alex-Nagase-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Professor of sociology Victor Rios spoke with students in the Loma Paloma Center on Tuesday about the United States justice system, race relations and mentorship opportunities.

People we might consider lost souls are like oysters, they are only going to open up when they are ready to change.”</p>\n<p>Rios said he felt disbelief upon being admitted to California State University East Bay, on academic probationary status and with a 1.9 grade point average, describing the occurrence as a “second chance.”</p>\n<p>“It’s important to speak truth and power, but it’s also important to speak truth to people,” Rios said. “Those college students spoke truth to me, and that is why I am here today … The social justice work that you do is a matter of life or death and I am just one example of this.”</p>\n<p>Rios encouraged the audience to consider applying to graduate school, which he said had opened doors for him.</p>\n<p>“Find your purpose and do something with your education that can open up doors for advocating for what you believe in,” Rios said.</p>\n<p>Third-year black studies and sociology double major Janet Lopez said she took Rios’ course on juvenile justice this past summer.</p>\n<p>“Rios is really down to earth and relatable since he is from the inner cities of Oakland,” Lopez said. “He has been through a lot in his life and he is a really genuine teacher. His life story and the way he interacts with his students is one of the main reasons why I really wanted to come to this talk tonight.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Stephanie Periban said Rios inspired her to act on issues affecting Latino students.</p>\n<p>“Rios is also a true inspiration for the Latino community. Anyone that could overcome the adversities Rios has faced and become the success story and inspiration he is today deserves a standing ovation,” Periban said.<br>\nThird-year sociology major Yessica Becerra said she enjoyed the event and hopes to take a course with Rios before graduating.</p>\n<p>“When I saw this event on Facebook, I got really excited and cleared my schedule,” Becerra said. “I’m really glad I’m here and get to experience him as a lecturer, and hope that in my last five quarters I have the opportunity to take a course with him.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Nov. 12, issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66425\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/professor-rios-lectures-on-justice-race/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66425\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/professor-rios-lectures-on-justice-race/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/professor-rios-lectures-on-justice-race/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/professor-rios-lectures-on-justice-race/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/professor-rios-lectures-on-justice-race/","id":2601,"author":{"id":142,"name":"Erin Kownacki"},"related":[2600,2599,2598],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"International Students Share Thanksgiving Experiences","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-new-logo.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-new-logo.png?resize=512%2C512&ssl=1","description":"Thanksgiving is known around the world as an American holiday where family and friends come together to give thanks over comfort food.

The holiday is only celebrated in a handful of locations including the United States, Canada, Norfolk Island, Puerto Rico and Liberia.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> spoke to international students and those studying abroad at UCSB to see how their Thanksgiving experiences compared to the images they had of the holiday.</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Alice Lomas is from Devon, England, and said she had an idealized image of Thanksgiving from American media.</p>\n<p>“I had seen [Thanksgiving] in all the American films, and I thought it was a massive family gathering with a turkey and a traditional Sunday roast experience, similar to what our Christmas is like,” Lomas said.</p>\n<p>While Lomas said she cooked and spent the holiday with friends, she said it was lacking because family is what makes the tradition special.</p>\n<p>“It kind of lived up to the expectations, but because we didn’t have our own family there, it was not the same,” Lomas said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Cæcilie Køhler is from Copenhagen, Denmark, and said she understood Thanksgiving after watching television shows and movies portraying the American tradition, which she added is similar to a Danish Christmas.</p>\n<p>“It’s like this in Denmark during Christmas. Some people even eat so much that they have to go to the hospital,” Køhler said, laughing.</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Xiaoyu Li from Beijing, China, compared his Thanksgiving experience in the U.S. to festivals in China because of Black Friday sales.</p>\n<p>“In China, there isn’t Thanksgiving, but there is a festival there that all the shops celebrate . . . It’s like a Black Friday sale,” Li said.</p>\n<p>Li said while he ate turkey and went Black Friday shopping during his first year at UCSB, this year he decided to spend it with friends making traditional Chinese food.</p>\n<p>“I went to Big Bear with a group of students and ate hot pot [an East Asian stew],” Li said.</p>\n<p>Second-year mathematical science major Omicron Wang from Chongqing, China, likened Thanksgiving to Spring Festival, known as Chinese New Year.</p>\n<p>“This is a time where every member of the family comes together,” Wang said. “We regard Thanksgiving in the U.S. as a regular holiday.”</p>\n<p>Second-year financial mathematics major Jennifer Sun from the Shandong province of China said although the food and traditions may be different, the values of the Chinese New Year and American Thanksgiving are similar.</p>\n<p>“When the Chinese New Year comes, we renew together and make traditional food like dumplings, just like people in the U.S. make traditional food and spend it with family,” Sun said.</p>\n<p>Second-year statistics major Shiwei Hua from Wuhan, China, said American Thanksgiving is similar to the Lunar Festival in China in some ways, but differs in others.</p>\n<p>“The Lunar Festival is when everywhere from the family gets together and eats traditional foods,” Hua said. “It’s a time for family to get together. I thought there would be many people in the street because during Lunar New Year we have games and puzzles all in the street.”</p>\n<p>Regardless of location or name, holidays provide an opportunity to celebrate one’s culture with the people, food and traditions that are important to them.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66915\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/international-students-share-thanksgiving-experiences/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66915\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/international-students-share-thanksgiving-experiences/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/international-students-share-thanksgiving-experiences/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/international-students-share-thanksgiving-experiences/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/international-students-share-thanksgiving-experiences/","id":2599,"author":{"id":117,"name":"Effie Sklavenitis"},"related":[2598,2597,2596],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
