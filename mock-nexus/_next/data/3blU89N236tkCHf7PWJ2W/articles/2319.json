For instance, the fee for the last UCen expansion, voted through in 1994, hasn’t risen from an initial figure of $20.42. <em>Stephany Rubio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Finance and Business (F&amp;B) committee voted on Feb. 26 to reallocate an existing fund for a new A.S. Bike Shop building toward a Bike Shop in the University Center (Ucen) instead. In late March, the Office of Budget and Planning provided updated calculations for the UCen fees.</p>\n<p>Students voted to approve a new bike shop building fund back in 2006. The building has never been built and students continue to use the existing Bike Shop building to repair their bicycles.</p>\n<p>F&amp;B Chair Kian Maalizadeh obtained updated calculations of how potential UCen student fees would look.</p>\n<p>With the Bike Shop funding now going toward the UCen renovation, the two student fees for the UCen project would decrease. The fees will be voted upon on the spring A.S. elections ballot.</p>\n<p>The first $21.42 fee is now $20.40 and will still be in effect from 2018 to 2022. The second $99.61 fee is now $96.06 and students will pay it from 2022 to 2052.</p>\n<p>Both fees will take effect if students vote to pass the UCen project later this month.</p>\n<p>In the 12 years since the fund was created, students have paid the resulting $5.50 quarterly student fee and voted to reaffirm it every two years. The fee has generated over $2 million in revenue in the process, Maalizadeh said.</p>\n<p>“We have this fee that’s being voted on every two years and that’s just sitting there to be used for a new Bike Shop,” Maalizadeh said. “[The UCen project] is the only plan that’s actually been proposed to use those student fees.”</p>\n<p>After the Bike Shop is built in the UCen, the lock-in fee associated with it would expire. The current Bike Shop building, located next to Parking Lot 29 on campus, would be demolished.</p>\n<p>Currently, the Bike Shop is housed in a 40-year-old cargo container that is “not meant for human occupation,” the official F&amp;B reallocation ballot language reads.</p>\n<p>“There are no bathrooms, the floors are rotting and it is a hazard to the students occupying the space,” the language reads.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UCen fee rises with inflation rates</strong></p>\n<p>While the UCen ballot petition language referred to two successive student fees, the second fee is not fixed. Instead, the fee will climb each year, roughly alongside inflation rates, according to a fee referendum document obtained by the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Before the 30-year fee was adjusted for the Bike Shop reallocation, it stood at $99.61. But with inflation rates, the fee rises each year by a rate that ranges between just under 0.7 percent to about 1.17 percent.</p>\n<p>As a result, the $99.61 fee increases to about $129.46 in 2052, the final year the fee would be in effect. That would push the total revenue generated from student fees to a number much higher than the $193 million the <em>Nexus </em><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/\">reported</a> in early March.</p>\n<p>Now, the $99.61 fee has been offset to $96.06, but inflation will still apply to the reduced fee, and the total amount of money raised from student fees will be much higher than $48 million, which is what officials say is the total cost of the project.</p>\n<p>It is unclear at this time how exactly the new projected fees would be affected by inflation.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Hieu Le did not confirm that the new amounts will rise by the same rates because no one has run the numbers yet, he said.</p>\n<p>“Those figures haven’t been calculated yet for these new numbers,” Le said. “But we do know, with this new $2 million in place, what the initial figures are.”</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Inflation estimates inconsistent across fees</strong></p>\n<p>Not many other student fees at UCSB appear to be affected by inflation. For instance, the fee for the last UCen expansion, voted through in 1994, hasn’t risen from an initial figure of $20.42.</p>\n<p>The inflated costs are lower than what real inflation rates will look like over the next 34 years, UCSB economics professor Peter Rupert told the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>“Realistic inflation is going to be more like 2 percent,” said Rupert, who also directs the local Economic Forecast Project. “Right now it’s incredibly low, it’s the lowest it’s ever been.”</p>\n<p>The UCen renovation, dubbed the “NewCen” initiative, was first proposed by Le in January. It would provide expanded office space to student services like Food Bank, Counseling and Psychological Services and Campus Learning Assistance Services. In addition, a renovated UCen would provide a 24/7 study space and a campus pub.</p>\n<p>With the F&amp;B’s reallocation, the finished UCen will also include a new A.S. Bike Shop.</p>\n<p>Students can vote to approve the initiative with 50 percent plus one “yes” vote on the spring A.S. elections ballot.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the

id=\"caption-attachment-67899\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Last year’s Dance Marathon raised approximately $16,000 for the hospital. <em>Alex Gonzalez / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara’s Dance Marathon (UCSBDM) will be holding its annual GauchoThon event on Feb. 10 in the Rob Gym, which will benefit the Neo-Natal and Pediatric Intensive Care Units at Santa Barbara’s Cottage Children’s Medical Center.</p>\n<p>Check in will begin at 11:30 a.m. and the event officially starts at noon.</p>\n<p>“GauchoThon is kind of like a jog-a-thon, but a dance-a-thon instead,” Zareena Zaidi, director of entertainment and co-director of marketing for the Dance Marathon at UCSB, in an email. “It’s just about having fun and supporting the kids.”</p>\n<p>According to Zaidi, the main idea of GauchoThon is simply to “stand for the kids who can’t.” Various UCSB groups are brought in to perform, play games and do other activities to entertain participants throughout the twelve-hour event.</p>\n<p>“We have kids — who are alive today because of the care they received from the hospital — come and tell their story, which I think is really impactful,” Zaidi said.</p>\n<p>“Miracle Childs,” or those who have received life-saving treatment at CCMC, will be at the event to share their stories and possibly dance with students. Zaidi believes that having the “Miracle Childs” in attendance helps connect participants with the cause and highlight how their fundraising is helping CCMC.</p>\n<p>CCMC hosts numerous fundraising events throughout the year, with GauchoThon being the finale of their year-long efforts and a celebration of the kids and the participants who fundraise.</p>\n<p>Ann Peyrat, liaison with CCMC, explained that the Dance Marathon at UCSB “provides a place for students to ‘belong’” while also benefiting other nonprofits on campus by “giving them a tabling opportunity to spotlight their mission.”</p>\n<p>Peyrat also explained that UCSB students volunteer countless hours for the cause.</p>\n<p>“UCSBDM members ‘table’ on campus, visit classrooms, residence halls, clubs and Greek life and host events. They take on leadership roles, form committees, hold weekly meetings and coordinate everything from catering, sponsorship, marketing, social media, entertainment, performances and visits from now healthy CCMC patients,” she said.</p>\n<p>Over the past five years, UCSBDM and GauchoThon have raised over $60,000 to support Cottage Hospital’s Neo-Natal and Pediatric Intensive Care Units.</p>\n<p>Zaidi said that there is no fundraising goal for this year, “just to raise as much as [they] possibly can.”</p>\n<p>Individual entry for the event requires a $5 donation to CCMC and registration information can be found on the events’ Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Even if students can’t make it out to this year’s event, there are still ways to donate and get involved. Donations will remain open until March and can be submitted on the events’ Facebook page. Registration for next year’s event will open up as early as Fall Quarter.</p>\n<p>“[UCSBDM students] are this generation fighting for the next. We couldn’t be more honored to have the support of Dance Marathon at UCSB,” Peyrat said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Today, the union represents approximately 24,000 UC workers, according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>The bargaining team, an elected body chosen to represent the workers, has the sole authority to call for a strike. The union’s bargaining team has met with the UC labor relations team nearly once every month for a year, according to de Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>According to a press release from the union, 97 percent of workers within the union voted to “authorize a system-wide strike” in mid-April.</p>\n<p>The release also asked speakers invited to UC graduation events to support union workers by “boycotting university engagements until the labor dispute is solved.”</p>\n<p>AFSCME conducted the voting over two days at locations across the UC’s 10 campuses, five medical centers and research laboratories among others, according to de Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>A small group of UC Santa Barbara students held a protest in front of De La Guerra dining commons on April 16 in support of the workers. AFSCME and other union workers within the UC have also previously held several protests on the UCSB campus, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/court-case-could-bring-financial-strain-to-public-sector-unions/\">most recently</a> on Feb. 15.</p>\n<p>The protests and subsequent vote to strike come following a <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/39pjpl3gf26b93t/A3299_PioneeringInequality_WhitePaperNEW_Web_lo-res.pdf?dl=0\">report</a> analyzing demographics of workers across the UC campuses written and released by AFSCME in early April.</p>\n<p>The report stated non-white employees, specifically those in African-American and Latinx communities, are “often hired into lower-paying titles,” while white people are “hired into higher-paying titles.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the report stated male workers were given a higher average hourly starting pay rate than female workers.</p>\n<p>The average hourly starting pay rate for a white male patient care worker was $32.53 while for the same job, an African-American female was giving an average starting hourly pay of $24.97, according to the report.</p>\n<p>The report also stated UC’s African-American workforce has shrunk by 37 percent since 1996.</p>\n<p>“A Black female patient care worker would need to work for 14 years to reach the starting pay of a white man,” the report states. “A Latina patient care worker would reach the starting wage of a white man after working for 13 years, and a Latina service worker would catch up to a white man’s starting wage after four years.”</p>\n<p>The report took data from UC employment records, according to de Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>“They’re all coming in [for] starting positions, and women of color are just being paid less,” he said.</p>\n<p>The UC has not yet released a public statement in response to the vote or the report, but de Los Angeles said the UC placed conditions in its union contracts “which is why our workers are so upset today.”</p>\n<p>Those conditions include raising the retirement age, raising healthcare rates and holding wages constant.</p>\n<p>“We strongly disagreed with AFSCME’s decision to strike, which will negatively impact patients, students and the UC community,” said Claire Doan, UCOP director of media relations, in an email. “What the union demanded was a 6 percent annual wage increase, which we think is unfair to other UC employees – both represented and non-represented. This is twice what other UC employees have received.”</p>\n<p>Doan said that UCOP has decided to increase AFSCME employees’ wages by two percent for the upcoming fiscal year.</p>\n<p>“UC presented AFSCME leaders with what we believe to be a competitive final settlement proposal that included multi-year wage increases (3 percent annual for four years) along with excellent health and retirement benefits,” she said. “They chose to reject it without conducting vote among their members.”</p>\n<p>The workers’ healthcare premiums will be “brought in line” with the rest of UC’s represented and non-represented employees and the retirement benefits of current employees will remain unchanged while new workers will be offered a choice between a tradition pension or a 401(k)-style plan, according to Doan.</p>\n<p>The raises were stalled for more than a year due to “protracted negotiations,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 26 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Update: This article was updated to include information about the union’s upcoming strike. </i></p>\n<p><em>Update: This article was updated to include a statement from the UC labor relations team. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Hernandez, with Campus United, and Vanessa Maldonado, with the Isla Vista Party. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Anthony Hernandez, with Campus United, and Vanessa Maldonado, with the Isla Vista Party, are the two candidates running for the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their opening remarks, Maldonado spoke about wanting to integrate the Student Apartment Council in A.S. and wanting to expand resources like CalFresh and Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) for students in university-owned off-campus apartments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez’s focus was about offering students a direct voice in senate and holding office hours at various university-owned off-campus apartments so students living there do not feel separated. </span></p>\n<p><b>FIRST PRIORITY:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado wants to focus on mental health services and work with the Santa Catalina residence hall to open up their C.A.P.S. center to students in university-owned off-campus housing. She would also like to implement free yoga programs like ones that currently exist in the freshman dorms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez wants to focus on revamping the orientation program for transfer students, since most students living in university-owned off-campus housing are transfer students. He said he is currently working with the Transfer Student Alliance on this issue and is interested in addressing the issue to make more students feel welcome at UC Santa Barbara when they first arrive. </span></p>\n<p><b>UNI-OWNED APARTMENTS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez plans to hold office hours within the various university-owned off-campus buildings in order to make himself and his position more available to students, as opposed to them having to come on campus to voice their concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado would work with the Student Apartment Council to fully integrate it with A.S., and she would also like to work with the transfer senator that is elected to meet the needs of students in university-owned off-campus housing.</span></p>\n<p><b>QUALIFICATIONS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado, as a current on-campus senator, explained she already has an understanding of the inner workings of A.S. and has experience listening to students’ concerns during public forum. She also believes that her strides to educate herself about issues regarding women of color make her better qualified to work as a senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez was the first diversity director for the Transfer Student Alliance and helped the organization work toward becoming an official A.S. entity. He also kickstarted the first transfer student graduation event, which is occurring later this year. </span></p>\n<p><b>STUDENTS’ NUMBER ONE PROBLEM:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez is interested in making students more active in their community, and he believes the best way to do so is by making resources available to students near their housing and not just on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado also wants to increase accessibility to resources provided by A.S. to students in university-owned off-campus apartments. In addition, she wants to increase awareness of C.A.P.S. and CalFresh. </span></p>\n<p><b>FAMILIES AND FACULTY OFF-CAMPUS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado, in order to reach out to these communities, would canvass or send out polls in order for people to voice their concerns and tell her what they need from her. She’s also interested in forming a council or committee for these communities to be represented in A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez wants to open up dialogue to these communities, as he explained that he does not live there and would not immediately know how to address their concerns, but is interested in finding out and working with theExternal Vice President for Statewide Affairs’ (EVPSA) office to get more funding for families and faculty in off-campus housing. </span></p>\n<p><b>UNIVERSITY APARTMENTS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez is interested in implementing more social activities for students in university-owned off-campus housing. He also wants to have more organizations come to them so that students in those buildings are aware of organizations on campus that represent them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado wants to continue to attend the meetings that students in university-owned off-campus housing hold and increase mental health resources available to them. </span></p>\n<p><b>PARKING:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado wants to offer the University Apartment Council the opportunity to directly voice their concerns to A.S. by integrating the council into A.S. She would also want to work with them to see if they already have ideas to solve the issue and just need help implementing them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez wants to open up this issue to the students and hear about ideas that they might have to address the issue and work to execute them as well as work with the EVPSA and External Vice President for Local Affairs’ office to get funding for the initiative. </span></p>\n<p><b>NEW IDEAS COMPARED TO LAST YEAR:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez wants to ensure students’ voices are heard and serve as a liaison between students and A.S. to meet their needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado feels the current university-owned off-campus senator has a good working relationship with the Transfer Senator and would like to carry on this relationship because  of the overlapping needs in both communities. She would also like to work closely with the Student Apartment Council, as the current university-owned off-campus senator does. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voting for the A.S. election began Monday, April 23, and closes Thursday, April 26.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
