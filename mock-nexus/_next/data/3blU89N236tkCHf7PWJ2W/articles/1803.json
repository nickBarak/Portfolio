For most, a year with that level of responsibility and amidst the party politics of A.S. is enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But one year later, Beasley shows no signs of slowing down. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Beasley ran for the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) position, the Nexus </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">endorsed his opponent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Alexandra Leal Silva, largely due to her three years of experience working in the office in comparison to Beasley, who was an outsider to A.S. at the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as we noted in our endorsement of Leal Silva at the time, both she and Beasley were confident, charismatic and genuine leaders who seemed to sincerely care about the well-being of UC Santa Barbara students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley is facing two opponents in this year’s election: third-year sociology major Daniel Segura-Esquivel, who is running with the Isla Vista Party, and second-year cell and developmental biology major Austin Foreman, who is running as an independent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus believes that Foreman is not suited for the position of president. It became clear in speaking to him that while he is passionate about what he does, he lacks the tangible experience needed to serve as a representative for the student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, he seems to lack a wider understanding of university and any tangible experience outside of A.S. When pressed about his experience and platform points, he faltered, and often talked in circles while failing to explain how he would feasibly pursue them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the largest reasons Foreman gave for running is that he wanted to work on improving the retention of A.S. career staff. While this is an admirable goal, it should not be the reason a student runs to be A.S. president, a position that is meant to serve all students, not just those within A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We believe that Foreman — who has introduced numerous resolutions focused on helping his fellow students over the past year while serving as an on-campus senator — would have been better off pursuing the position of Internal Vice President. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In regard to Segura-Esquivel, the Nexus believes the third-year student is incredibly capable of being the next A.S. president, if elected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the three hours in which we spoke to him, it became clear he has acquired the wide range of knowledge needed to be this campus’ A.S. president and that his passion for students is nearly unmatched. He stressed that his identity as a “brown, queer, first generation, low-income student” has allowed him to be at the forefront of campus issues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of his platform points — centered around helping students with basic needs as well as establishing emergency protocols — are not particularly innovative, as they echo ones proposed both this year and the year before by candidates running for A.S. positions. But Segura-Esquivel, refreshingly, was able to back up his platform points with detailed plans for accomplishing them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, during our interview, Segura-Esquivel often went on tangents and strayed far from the question at hand. While we appreciated his enthusiasm, his answers brought into question his ability to effectively communicate on behalf of students to administrators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley, in comparison, was an approachable candidate who was able to get his point across easily, which assured us of his ability to do the same with both the average student and administrator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, in any other election year, Segura-Esquivel would be the clear choice for our endorsement. But due to Beasley’s year of executive experience and his extensive history of advocacy for UCSB students, the Nexus chose Beasley for our endorsement, with the firm belief that he would be the best president for our campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As EVPSA, Beasley seemingly worked tirelessly to help advocate on behalf of students; the EVPSA is a unique position within A.S., involving extensive lobbying and traveling between D.C. and Sacramento. In addition to serving as EVPSA, Beasley is also a resident assistant this year. His ability to balance the two intensive time commitments while taking classes is certainly impressive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But even with these hurdles, Beasley helped bring to fruition </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-06-28/uc-gains-4-million-in-funding-for-summer-financial-aid/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$10 million in summer financial aid</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for students through his role with the Coalition for a Better UC and countlessly lobbied on behalf of UCSB students as EVPSA, speaking repeatedly to both UC administrators, including UC President Janet Napolitano, and elected officials in California and Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During his interview with the Nexus, Beasley made clear his vast knowledge of the campus, speaking extensively to both his history with the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black Student Union demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well as advocating against </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/uc-student-governments-call-for-divestment-of-thirty-meter-telescope-project/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thirty Meter Telescope Project at Mauna Kea</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which the UC helps fund. He noted that he hopes to continue both projects if elected president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of Beasley’s platform points fall under two categories, he explained in his interview: access and advocacy. He wants to continue current A.S. President Alison Sir’s projects, including her </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-18/proposed-vending-machine-in-i-v-aimed-at-addressing-food-insecurity-in-near-future/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vending machine project</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — a project aimed at providing food to low-income students — as well as finding a permanent location for the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-15/committee-moves-forward-with-plans-for-permanent-a-s-bike-shop/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bike shop</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, something also pursued by Sir’s predecessor, former A.S. President Brooke Kopel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of [Sir’s] goals were cut short by COVID … I definitely want to make sure that those projects have a home in my office and [are seen] through to completion,” Beasley said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that he also wants to focus on returning free night and weekend parking to students, who initially voted for </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/students-in-2003-voted-for-free-night-and-weekend-parking-sixteen-years-later-where-is-it/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“free” night and weekend parking</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through a lock-in fee in 2003. But that “free” parking only lasted five years; now, if students want to park on campus during nights and weekends, they are required to purchase a $52.50 permit that lasts for three quarters. Beasley said he has already had a few conversations with Transportation and Parking Services (TPS) over this issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Foreman, Beasley also aims to make sure students have “adequate access” to mental health resources and know their options, if elected. He noted that “you never really know what you’re getting into when you go [to C.A.P.S.],” adding that “C.A.P.S. isn’t for everybody.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I first went [to C.A.P.S.], there were no available Black psychologists. And when I asked for one, I kind of got laughed at. I ended up being able to go out into the community to find Acacia Health and Wellness,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to many executive candidates this year, Beasley hopes to establish a standardized emergency response protocol at the university. He explained that in his time at UCSB, he’s seen a gap between the administration and its students when times of emergencies struck, such as during the 2017 Thomas Fire and the current coronavirus pandemic. He noted that he had “countless meetings” with administrators to help address students’ needs before the coronavirus shut down the campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that there needs to be more outreach between the administration and students in terms of advocacy, particularly on administrators’ parts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students are constantly having to go to [administrators’ doors] … ‘Can we have a meeting? Can we talk about this? Where’s the funding for Black students? Where’s the funding for Native American students?’ That shouldn’t have to be a recurring conversation,” Beasley said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Next year as president, I will make sure that administration is able to reach out to students and ask them what they need instead of the other way around,” he continued.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, the Nexus believes that Beasley’s passion, combined with the relationships he already has with UC administration, gives him a leg up over anyone else. He has also shown the ability to adapt through his time in office, tacking on projects he hadn’t run on, like the TMT project, and turning them into major initiatives for his office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus believes that Beasley will use this tangible experience as EVPSA to his benefit if elected president; he has worked incredibly hard to highlight efforts that otherwise may have slipped through the cracks. He has proven time and time again over this year as EVPSA that he has the ability to advocate for change at the highest levels. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected as the next president, the Nexus</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">believes that Beasley will not only continue the work he is already doing, but use his unique qualifications to truly listen to his constituents and go above and beyond to create tangible change on this campus.</span></p>\n<p><em>Update: The Nexus has replaced the portraits done of each candidate with their self-submitted headshot.

focus to becoming a resource for students and finding meaningful digital alternatives to in-person events. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While student leaders are getting creative behind their screens to make their organizations accessible to students who are spread across the country, many have shifted their focus to becoming a resource for students and finding meaningful digital alternatives to in-person events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Office of Student Life (OSL), there are currently </span><a href=\"https://shoreline.ucsb.edu/club_signup?group_type=24931&amp;category_tags=\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">366 registered campus organizations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at UCSB, many of whom are attempting to transfer their membership services and activities online. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christine Kim, a fourth-year economics major and current president of the American Marketing Association (AMA) at UCSB — a professional organization offering students hands-on experience in marketing through internship opportunities and workshops —  said there was uncertainty among the executive members during the AMA’s transition to remote operation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At first, when we heard about the email, we thought we were just going to have to put everything on pause. Our main events are the general meetings we have biweekly in a big room where we invite [guest speakers],” Kim said. “We weren’t completely sure how to make all that virtual.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, after re-evaluating their options, Kim and the AMA executive board decided that the AMA would continue general meetings through email newsletters sharing webinars on various marketing topics and slide decks with project updates and internship opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everything’s just been really difficult to transition to. We want to run our organization while still being flexible to everyone’s circumstances, and so by doing a newsletter format … they can access the slide deck and the webinar or the event any time they want to,” Kim explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to transitioning meetings online, student organizations have also been forced to cancel upcoming in-person events and to consider the prospect of hosting virtual replacements. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frances Woo, a third-year sociology major and current editor-in-chief of Um… Magazine, an online and print publication for marginalized voices, said that the coronavirus pandemic has impacted the organization’s plans for print distribution and its benefit concert fundraiser.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Normally what we do every quarter is we collect submissions, compile and design them into a physical print magazine, and then we have a launch event where we distribute them all around IV and on campus,” Woo said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We usually have a benefit concert fundraiser too, but because we can’t do that physically, we’re trying to figure out remote ways to do it, maybe like a livestream session or sort of a video we can put out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there will be no physical print for the magazine this quarter, Woo said they will instead focus on their </span><a href=\"https://www.ummagazine.online/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> platform. Um… Magazine is currently accepting art submissions for its </span><a href=\"https://www.ummagazine.online/submission\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remote volume</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and creative competition, both of which are projects that aim to shed light on the social implications of the coronavirus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intersectional Feminists (IFEM), a community organization centered around intersectionality, education and empowerment of marginalized voices, is also addressing the social impacts of coronavirus by serving as a resource for students, according to Ky Youssef, a third-year sociology and environmental studies major and president of IFEM. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We completely acknowledge this is a hard time for some for many reasons and understand the hardships with some people going back to their families. Our social media is open for anyone to come talk to,” Youssef said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IFEM has opted to forgo holding general meetings through online methods such as Zoom — the organization is instead having officers do weekly takeovers on the Intersectional Feminists </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ucsbintersectfeminists/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to educate members on topics each officer is passionate about, Youssef explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We did one last week by our historian, Alana, who did a spiel about mental health tips during this quarantine. She talked about grounding techniques which can help with anxiety,” Youssef said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of fostering social connections that are typically forged in person, the transition to online operation has proven to be an ongoing challenge for student organizations. Kim noted how online methods of communication, while effective in conveying information, lack the personal nature of in-person interactions that help create a sense of community among AMA members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think our organization benefits a lot from having that community aspect … It’s been challenging to continue that priority for our organization, like the face-to-face network, because you can establish a lot of strong professional connections just through that,” Kim said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shift to digital operation has also had a considerable effect on member participation, as it is increasingly difficult for organizations to track meeting attendance and facilitate projects that normally occur in person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Of course, we have a lower number of members attending [general meetings]. We’re not completely sure if it’s people going through the slide deck and watching the webinar and forgetting to sign in, or if members aren’t participating,” Kim explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, group projects in Um… Magazine have been challenging to facilitate solely through Zoom, according to Woo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the general members want to work on group projects with each other, but it’s hard, especially with Zoom, where only one person can talk at a time, to establish those connections and especially new connections with new members,” Woo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In trying to adapt to quarantine life and online courses, many student organization leaders have yet to establish a long-term operation plan in the event that remote instruction and </span><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/danvergano/coronavirus-distancing-new-normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">social distancing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> progress beyond spring quarter and summer session. As of now, student organizations are taking it day by day, focusing on what they can accomplish through digital means. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youssef noted that while IFEM is unsure about future plans, it will continue to remain an active resource by attending virtual town halls and education webinars.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, spring quarter will be a time for student organizations to experiment with digital modes of outreach and make the appropriate adjustments to create a concrete method of operation, as explained by Woo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think a lot of what we decide this quarter will just be prolonged as long as social distancing goes. This quarter is going to be a lot of testing stuff out and seeing what works and what doesn’t,” Woo said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94243\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-30/the-elephant-in-the-zoom-how-student-orgs-are-adapting-to-virtual-member-engagement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94243\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-30/the-elephant-in-the-zoom-how-student-orgs-are-adapting-to-virtual-member-engagement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-30/the-elephant-in-the-zoom-how-student-orgs-are-adapting-to-virtual-member-engagement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-30/the-elephant-in-the-zoom-how-student-orgs-are-adapting-to-virtual-member-engagement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-30/the-elephant-in-the-zoom-how-student-orgs-are-adapting-to-virtual-member-engagement/","id":1801,"author":{"id":282,"name":"Michelle Lee"},"related":[1800,1799,1798],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Places Fifth in Final Competition","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Golf","publish_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In its final outing of the season, the UCSB men’s golf team finished fifth out of nine schools in the Big West Championship at the La Quinta Mountain Course on April 29, 30 and May 1.

He was replaced by junior Jordan Epstein who struggled, putting up a total of 240.</p>\n<p>“It is kind of tough to get the call at the last minute, and Jordan has been kind of struggling with his game.” Lass said. “It made things a little more difficult for the team but all in all I thought fifth place was a good finish.”</p>\n<p>To finish off his career, senior Russell Boring tied for No. 16 overall, as he improved his score by one each day, going from 74 to 73 and finally to a 72 in day three, totaling to 219. Freshman Hunter Robinson tied for No. 26 with a 223.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got a bunch of great guys on our team, lots of talent,” Kita said. “In the second round we played a great round of golf. We shot like 500 as a team, so obviously the talent is there, so hopefully we will be able to keep this going. It should be good for the future Gauchos.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46659\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/ucsb-places-final-competition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46659\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/ucsb-places-final-competition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/ucsb-places-final-competition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/ucsb-places-final-competition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-04/ucsb-places-final-competition/","id":1802,"author":{"id":76,"name":"Caleb Shoffner"},"related":[1801,1800,1799],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
