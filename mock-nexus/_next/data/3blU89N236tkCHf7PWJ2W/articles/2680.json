Since then, more than 320,000 people in 98 cities throughout the country have attended Send Silence Packing. The event displays 1,100 backpacks to represent the 1,100 college students who lose their lives to suicide each year. According to the Suicide Prevention Resource Center, suicide is the second-leading cause of death for college students.</p>\n<p>Active Minds staff advisor and Associate Director of Student Mental Health Coordination Services Ryan Sims said the host organizations have worked hard to make the event possible.</p>\n<p>“The event really has been three years in the making,” Sims said. “Active Minds has partnered with Mental Wellness Center to fundraise over $5,000 to put the event on, which is something we are very proud of.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Mental Wellness Center CEO Annmarie Cameron said universities have to “compete” to host a Send Silence Packing event.</p>\n<p>“The process of getting Send Silence Packing to come to UCSB has taken three years,” Cameron said. “To qualify, the university itself has to provide adequate emotional support for the students that are impacted by the exhibit and UCSB’s mental health services are exceptional for this type of event.”</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. Director Jeanne Stanford said she hopes seeing backpacks at the event will “make it real” for students that suicide can affect their peers.</p>\n<p>“I hope the message that people will take away is that we are all affected by suicide,” Stanford said. “Talking to your friend if you see that they’re struggling and knowing how to help someone struggling is so important for college students.”</p>\n<p>Sims said he believes the “powerful display” will prompt those passing by to consider what the backpacks represent.</p>\n<p>“Many of the backpacks were created by friends, family members and partners of those that have passed away and include the student’s personal stories, pictures and treasured personal belongings,” Sims said. “I’m most looking forward to UCSB students pausing for a moment, taking this all in and thinking about who might be writing their story if they’re considering suicide as a way of ending their pain.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Lauren Peterson said she will attend the event because she struggled with depression and anxiety her first year at UCSB, but hesitated to seek out metal health services in fear of others thinking less of her.</p>\n<p>“Mental health stigmas prevented me from seeking help or even talking to anyone about my depression and anxiety,” Peterson said. “Once I was able to talk to others, their acceptance and drive to learn more about mental health was so relieving and helped me greatly.”</p>\n<p>Due to the sensitive nature of this event, Sims said C.A.P.S. will provide psychologists for the event.</p>\n<p>“Everyone will be impacted uniquely, and having these psychologists on the day of is a cornerstone of being selected as a school to host,” Sims said.</p>\n<p>Stanford said Send Silence Packing will serve as a “kickoff event” for UC Student Association’s upcoming mental health campaign, #HowAreYou.</p>\n<p>“Most people that are considering suicide do want to talk about it. Something as simple as ‘how are you’ can really help someone that is struggling with a mental illness,” Stanford said.</p>\n<p>Active Minds will host their first informational meeting on Tuesday in the SRB multipurpose room at 6 p.m. for students interested in the organization.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65167\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/send-silence-packing-to-feature-backpack-display-that-signifies-lives-lost-to-suicide/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65167\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/send-silence-packing-to-feature-backpack-display-that-signifies-lives-lost-to-suicide/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/send-silence-packing-to-feature-backpack-display-that-signifies-lives-lost-to-suicide/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/send-silence-packing-to-feature-backpack-display-that-signifies-lives-lost-to-suicide/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/send-silence-packing-to-feature-backpack-display-that-signifies-lives-lost-to-suicide/","id":2680,"author":{"id":142,"name":"Erin Kownacki"},"related":[2679,2678,2677],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":142,"name":"Erin Kownacki","biography":"Not available","articles":[2601,2680,2689,2704,6894],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Monologues Shed Light on UCSB LGBTQ Community","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Resource Center for Sexual & Gender Diversity (RCSGD) hosted “Coming Out Monologues” Monday evening in the Hub to celebrate LGBTQ History Month and National Coming Out Day, which takes place O...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity (RCSGD) hosted “Coming Out Monologues” Monday evening in the Hub to celebrate LGBTQ History Month and National Coming Out Day, which takes place Oct. 11.</p>\n<p>Students of varying genders and sexual identities attended the event to recount stories of discovering and revealing their identity. Speakers shared their experiences coming out during the initial portion of the event, followed by an open mic for attendees to share their own stories.</p>\n<p>Third-year history major William Roberts said the event communicated the “diversity of experiences” people have when coming out.</p>\n<p>“Revealing [coming out] as not to be the one-time event … but as a complex, sometimes difficult, but ultimately beautiful and liberating experience felt differently by all queer and trans people,” Roberts said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year communication major Jean Mack, whose name has been changed, said she has a “split lifestyle” because she has not come out as bisexual in her hometown in Northern California but is involved with many LGBTQ events at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“It’s very freeing to be in a community where you can be your whole self,” Mack said. “I think for many people, especially coming in as freshmen, it’s their first experience where they can be around queer people.”</p>\n<p>Mack said she was comfortable speaking at the “Coming Out Monologues” because organizers reached out to a wide range of identities when advertising the event.</p>\n<p>“I think a very subtle thing … which I hope they continue doing, is putting all sorts of identities on the poster itself for the event,” Mack said. “[It] was a big deal for me because, as a bisexual woman, I often feel like I’m not straight enough for straight places and I’m not queer enough for gay spaces so it’s this weird in-between.”</p>\n<p>Second-year chemistry major Shelley Alvarez, whose name and year have been changed, said being queer at UCSB is “a lot less alienating” than she expected, but finding spaces for everyday interactions is still difficult.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the settings in which people congregate to are very sexual in nature, or they involve a lot of drinking and hook-ups and sometimes you just want to find a group of people to hang out with and have fun with,” Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>According to RCGSD Graduate Assistant and Ph.D. candidate Alex Kulick, LGBTQ communities and resources on campus and in I.V. need to be made more apparent to students.</p>\n<p>“I think one of the big issues that I’ve noticed really is a lack of visibility,” Kulick said. “There’s certainly a lot of spaces, especially in Isla Vista, that are not necessarily visibly queer or don’t have any visible presence of queer-friendly spaces.”</p>\n<p>Kulick said it was his first time attending the “Coming Out Monologues.”</p>\n<p>“I was just really, really impressed by the courage of the students and the vulnerability that they were able to share, and also, I think the diversity of the experiences that were showcased along different lines of gender, race, ethnicity, class and, of course, all types of different other experiences that people come from.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The committee fully granted six requests, partially granted six requests and tabled two requests.</p>\n<p>Delta Sigma Pi requested $656 for a campus event and $2,300 to send five members to the Leadership and Excellence Academies for Deltasigs in New Mexico.</p>\n<p>Delta Sigma Pi member Austin Kang said the group’s first request was for an Oct. 23 event to educate UCSB students about the nonprofit organization Liberty in North Korea, which helps North Koreans escape to other countries.</p>\n<p>“We are hopeful that [this event] will bring awareness about the condition and the situations that people in North Korea live in,” Kang said. “There is going to be at least one refugee that will speak.”</p>\n<p>The committee fully funded the group $656 but tabled its request for $2,300 to the Oct. 12 meeting.</p>\n<p>KCSB representative Matt Merritt requested $2,000 for Hello World!, a music festival on Oct. 10 in Anisq’Oyo’ Park that will feature Scientist, The Lions and Cornerstone.</p>\n<p>“We are bringing these groups, musical groups, from all around the world to come and perform,” Merritt said. “We are educating the community on these groups and their cultures. And then also educational in the sense that we are bringing members of our own community in one place to appreciate and discover each other’s culture.”</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund KCSB.</p>\n<p>UCSB League of Legends (L.o.L.) treasurer Elaine Hu and public relations chair Albert Chen requested $80 for a gaming event Oct. 11at the Loma Pelona Center.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund UCSB L.o.L.</p>\n<p>Swing and Ballroom Dance Club co-treasurer Cecilia Gutierrez and president Steve Carlan requested $2,594 for a free swing dance event Oct. 24 in the Student Resource Building.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fund the club $1,460 for a band, refreshments and Community Service Officers (CSO’s) at the event.</p>\n<p>Cotillion Dance Club treasurer Alex Vera and vice president Samuel Anspach requested $2,921 for the club’s annual dance competition, Beach Ball.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fund the club $2,120 to hire professional dancers for the event.</p>\n<p>Transfer Student Alliance requested for $426 for their first general meeting on Oct. 14 in the Student Resource Building.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund the group for its upcoming event.</p>\n<p>On-campus senator and second-year political science major José Magaña requested $2,474 from senate unallocated funds for condom dispensers to place in bathrooms around campus.</p>\n<p>CCS Collegiate Senator and third-year CCS chemistry and biochemistry major Dustin Larrazolo said the committee should fund Magaña’s project, because it fully granted KCSB’s request.</p>\n<p>“Safe sex is more important than a broadcasting radio station’s event,” Larrazolo said.</p>\n<p>Kevin Koo recommended Magaña request funds through a campus organization in order to access OSL funds as opposed to senate unallocated.</p>\n<p>“He is working with other student groups and OSL groups,” Koo said. “He could just come in next week.”</p>\n<p>The committee voted to table Magaña’s request until its Oct. 12 meeting, suggesting he seek other funding options throughout the week.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B then voted to fund Lindy Circle $2,000 out of its first request of $2,743, as well as $520 of its second request of $580.</p>\n<p>Alpha Tau Omega (ATO) member Charles Jones requested $7,995 for its annual, three-day Greeks 4 Kids fundraising event, which includes a carnival, dodgeball tournament and dance-off.</p>\n<p>The committee funded ATO $6,595, including $3,200 to rent Campbell Hall for the dance-off.</p>\n<p>Professor of sociology John Foran requested $1,006 on behalf of System Change Not Climate Change for the group’s upcoming conference, 21st Century Ecosocialism: Practicing System Change, Making Connections, Building a Movement, which will take place Oct. 9 through Oct. 11.</p>\n<p>Foran said the conference is an opportunity to educate students who are not taking classes about environmental issues.</p>\n<p>“Certainly this is something that should be of great interest to our students in a number of other classes on campus,” Foran said.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to fully fund System Change Not Climate Change.</p>\n<p>The committee then voted to grant UCSB Students for Bernie Sanders the $175 it requested for a Democratic presidential debate viewing event Oct. 13 in the Hub and to grant BSU the $590 it requested.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article did not include the entirety of Larrazolo’s quote and misnamed his majors.

Senate, reforming Science, Technology, Aerospace and Research Kapital (S.T.A.R.K.) funding and to vote on the five bills presented at last week’s meeting.</p>\n<p>The S.T.A.R.K. bill, approved in January 2013, sets aside $10,000 to be used by science and engineering student organizations on large-scale projects, in addition to their own fundraising efforts. Assistant Director of Technology Sean Lieberman, Residence Hall Association (RHA) President Matilda Mead and second-year political science major On-campus Senator Jose Magaña presented to senate during public forum.</p>\n<p>At last week’s senate meeting, On-campus Senator and second-year economics and political science double major Nawar Nemeh presented “A Bill to Switch Associated Students Elections to a Single Transferable Vote System.”</p>\n<p>Lieberman said implementing single transferable voting, in which voters would rank each candidate, would require adapting the online voting system. According to Lieberman, UC Berkeley currently utilizes a single transferable voting system and produces election results in three to seven days, while UCSB tabulates votes within three hours.</p>\n<p>“I would call [single transferable voting] low voter patience. We’ve never asked people to rank 30 candidates in past elections,” Lieberman said. “In order to explain what effect the complex nature of single transferable voting will have on counting the votes, I read Berkeley’s elections code regarding tallying. They give three to seven days — three is the minimum — to seven days and we usually get it [the results] out in three hours.”</p>\n<p>Mead said she is working to establish RHA liaisons in A.S Senate and Committee meetings, and productivity could increase if A.S. and RHA worked together.</p>\n<p>“I’ve decided to shift the RHA’s focus to putting a greater focus on advocacy and initiative,” Mead said. “Our residents are affected the same way your students are affected.”</p>\n<p>Mead also said there may be concerns of potentially conflicting interests between students and Housing &amp; Residential Services (HRS) if RHA were to work with A.S Senate and Committees, but the benefits outweigh the potential costs.</p>\n<p>“I completely agree that some committees are not suitable for RHA members to sit on,” Mead said. “Luckily, there are many other committees that are, and all of these committees that potentially benefit from having a member the residence halls report to and from [RHA] organization.”</p>\n<p>Magaña said he hopes to increase the impact RHA has on A.S and expand the responsibilities of floor representatives, which he believes will improve student body representation.</p>\n<p>“I will send bills and resolutions that they can look over because I believe in direct representation from my constituents,” Magaña said. “We represent RHA here, but RHA has its own committee so they have a direct representation of people in the residence hall.”</p>\n<p>According to Magaña, floor representatives are willing to increase their responsibilities once they are more involved in A.S.</p>\n<p>“I’ve talked to past floor reps about retention,” Magaña said. “Some of their concerns is not necessarily about hour commitment but because they feel like they didn’t have much say even though their position is immensely important.”</p>\n<p>Magaña then presented “A Resolution to Create an Ad-Hoc Committee to Fill the Vacant On-Campus Senate Position.”</p>\n<p>College of Creative Studies (CCS) Collegiate Senator and third-year biochemistry and chemistry major Dustin Larrazolo presented bills on forming an A.S. Student Councils and establishing funds.</p>\n<p>Larrazolo presented “A Bill to Establish A.S. Student Councils” which outlines a plan to provide a legislative outlet for CCS and College of Engineering (CoE) students to voice their opinions.</p>\n<p>“The CCS student council held their first forum and got 40 attendees,” Larrazolo said. “[CCS and CoE] will be able to get a lot more resources that they do not have and also be more connected with A.S.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo then presented “A Bill to Redefine S.T.A.R.K. funds” and “A Bill to Establish the Creative, Artistic, Research, and Diversity Fund,” which outlines two A.S funds to support students’ academic projects and research.</p>\n<p>Senate moved seven new bills and five old bills from last week to the Campus Affairs committee.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65140\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/a-s-senate-meets-to-discuss-rha-representatives-in-senate-s-t-a-r-k-funding/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65140\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/a-s-senate-meets-to-discuss-rha-representatives-in-senate-s-t-a-r-k-funding/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/a-s-senate-meets-to-discuss-rha-representatives-in-senate-s-t-a-r-k-funding/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/a-s-senate-meets-to-discuss-rha-representatives-in-senate-s-t-a-r-k-funding/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/a-s-senate-meets-to-discuss-rha-representatives-in-senate-s-t-a-r-k-funding/","id":2679,"author":{"id":123,"name":"Chris Perez"},"related":[2678,2677,2676],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
