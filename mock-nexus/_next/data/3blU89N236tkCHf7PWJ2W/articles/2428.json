Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>An executive order barring travel from seven countries prompted over 200 people to protest at UC Santa Barbara Monday, echoing voices that spoke out nationally against the new presidency.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">signed an order Friday to ban travel from Muslim-majority countries Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia for 90 days. </span></p>\n<p>As reports of detainees began to surface at airports throughout the country, Naia Al-Anbar, a Muslim woman and third-year anthropology student, began organizing a protest march at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Both of Al-Anbar’s parents are immigrants: her mother gained U.S. citizenship after immigrating from Mexico and her father currently holds a green card from Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>“I was just furious,” Al-Anbar said when she was reading the executive order. “When you push someone to the very edge … you want to be a part of a group that is just as outraged as you are.”</p>\n<p>Working with Queers Against Fascism, the Muslim Student Association and the Student Activist Network, she put together the protest in two days.</p>\n<p>Rallying the crowd at the beginning of the protest, organizers described themselves as “unapologetically Muslim.” Heeba Saleem, a fourth-year literature student, quoted the Quran saying, “<span style=\"font-weight:

One of these students is an undergraduate from Syria, two are undergraduates from Iran and the remaining 37 are graduate students from Iran.</p>\n<p>According to Janet Afary, a professor of Iranian studies, there is “a great deal of anxiety” among graduate students at UCSB who cannot return to Iran in fear that their visas may not be renewed.</p>\n<p>Leila Zonouzi, an Iranian student pursuing a Ph.D. in global studies, planned to wed her fiance this summer. She said her parents and in-laws are in Iran, but since the executive order halted immigration from that country, they are unable to fly to the U.S. for the wedding.</p>\n<p>“I won’t be able to get married because, well, let’s face it, without our parents, who are we celebrating with?” she said.</p>\n<p>Zonouzi said the travel ban also affects visas for her fiancé’s job and her academic career. Her fiancé, who is also Iranian with a visa expiring in a year, may not apply for an H-1 visa or a green card “if this continues.” Zonouzi has a two-year visa expiring in June 2018 while enrolled in a five- to seven-year program.</p>\n<p>“With this rate of madness, I’m not actually sure I can extend it and be a Ph.D. candidate,” Zonouzi said.</p>\n<p>Another UCSB student affected by the travel ban is Mahdi Golkaram, an Iranian mechanical engineering Ph.D. student who said he won’t be able to see his parents for years. His parents received their visas two weeks ago after applying at the U.S. embassy and undergoing a background check for nine months.</p>\n<p>“Because of the executive order, they can’t come to the United States because anyone from Iran is banned from entering the United States using any passport visa,” Golkaram said.</p>\n<p>The ban has also affected Golkaram’s job opportunities. He said he doesn’t know if he can apply for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) required for his internship placement this fall since the ban limits requests going through to the USCIS for Iranian people.</p>\n<p>“A lot of companies that I have job offers for right now are contacting me and asking if I know what my visa and resident situation is going to be,” he said. “Even if the companies are fine with me, they will be anxious about whether or not I can accept the job offer.”</p>\n<p>A Reddit user, posting as an Iranian-Canadian UCSB student on Saturday, said he or she was “sent back in Germany” while trying to reenter the U.S. after a trip to Tehran, Iran.</p>\n<p>The Nexus confirmed that Yousefian Jazi and Rasekh did not post on Reddit. The Nexus has sent the Reddit user a private message each day since Saturday, but the user has not yet replied.</p>\n<p>Kraig Rice, an immigration attorney with Juris Doctor California, said Iranian-Canadians would have been denied entry into the U.S on Friday and Saturday. The Trump administration announced Sunday that it would begin to allow entry to Canadian dual citizens.</p>\n<p>The order originally barred all permanent residents and all visas except foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations and G-1, G-2, G-3 and G-4 visas.</p>\n<p>United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) began allowing entry to green card holders on Sunday. Those with student visas, however, are still prohibited from entering the country, according to Abbe Kingston, an immigration attorney based in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“The craziness is there are already people who have been vetted, have already been interviewed, some on airplanes,” Kingston said. “That’s the hysteria it’s created. No one really thought this plan through.”</p>\n<p>In a press release Saturday, the UC Office of the President advised students from the seven countries listed in the executive order to not travel outside the United States. OISS recommends that all international students avoid travel outside the U.S.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, February 2, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

it should be cheaper or even free.”</p>\n<p>Along with the $79.99 purchase of commencement regalia from the UCen Bookstore, which includes the graduation stole, tassel, cap and gown, the increased demand for lodging inflates the prices of hotels for families and friends.</p>\n<p>Frank Duffy, a manager at the Hampton Inn Santa Barbara/Goleta, said the hotel management increases room prices by about $100 per night for graduation weekend.</p>\n<p>A spokesperson from the Kimpton Goodland accounting department said when demand increases, prices also increase based off the hotel’s capacity.</p>\n<p>A manager at the Goleta Courtyard Marriott also said they take the market price of hotel rooms into consideration when they set their prices.</p>\n<p>This price increase, however, does not seem to affect local Airbnbs because of the consistent shifts in supply and lodging capacity.</p>\n<p>According to an Airbnb press release with data from Smith Travel Research, the average cost of an Airbnb room was $162 in 2016, while the average price of a hotel room was $367.</p>\n<p>This data includes hotels only from the city of Santa Barbara, not the county.</p>\n<p>“Our hosts typically do not raise their prices. If they do, it’s very, very slightly,” said Jasmine Mora, an Airbnb spokesperson. “As a consumer you’re just not going to book that listing.”</p>\n<p>The lower prices are also because more hosts are signing up for Airbnb to rent out their rooms.</p>\n<p>According to Airbnb, 9 percent of users rented out Airbnb rooms for the first time during graduation weekend. This increase in supply helps to accommodate the increase in demand without over-inflating prices.</p>\n<p>However, not all travel and lodging services are increasing prices in preparation for graduation weekend.</p>\n<p>Deanna Zachrisson, spokesperson for the Santa Barbara Airport, said she did not see a correlation between graduation weekend and increased flight prices.</p>\n<p>“There’s a whole number of factors that influence the prices of tickets,” she said. “It also can be the size of the aircraft … it’s really impossible to say that there’s a direct correlation between graduation traffic and cost.”</p>\n<p>Zachrisson also said college students make up a low percentage of the airport’s customers.</p>\n<p>Some graduation fees imposed by the university are charged only out of necessity, not to profit off of students.</p>\n<p>The Office of the Registrar charges an approximately $19 fee to every student graduating in order to process and send them their diplomas. The fee is an average rate to accommodate everyone, including those from smaller classes and international students that have more expensive shipping costs.</p>\n<p>She said diplomas for large graduating class sizes are cheaper than smaller class sizes because it is less expensive to buy in bulk.</p>\n<p>“It basically goes to cover the cost of the vendor for handling and mailing the diploma,” said the Uuniversity Registrar Leesa Beck. “You wouldn’t want someone to just drop your diploma in a manila envelope and drop it in a mailbox.”</p>\n<p>Beck said the diplomas are printed and sent by a third-party, out-of-state vendor.</p>\n<p>She also said it was “hard to say” if the total $19 goes directly to diplomas since the prices vary depending on graduating class and international shipping rates.</p>\n<p>Replacement diplomas are considerably more expensive at $50 domestically and $75 internationally, which Beck said was partly a “deterrent fee” meant to stop students from ordering multiple copies of their diploma, since they are only supposed to have one. She said this also works to prevent diploma fraud.</p>\n<p>Beck said if students can prove their diploma was lost or destroyed, the university frequently waives the fee.</p>\n<p>These costs only include the graduation essentials; however, an extra stole is sold at the Bookstore for $29.99 and a Classic Diploma Frame costs $150 and does not qualify for free shipping.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the June 8, 2017, print issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

In-state tuition has remained at $11,220 since the 2011-12 academic year, and this proposed hike will increase tuition by $282.</p>\n<p>During the public forum, the Regents received several remarks on the tuition increase, which will be voted on during Thursday morning’s meeting. Commenters also critiqued some of the logistical problems with the UC’s intended expansion, as the UC intends to enroll an additional 10,000 students over the next three years.</p>\n<p>Susan Willats, an employee at UC Santa Cruz for 30 years, said the University’s increased student population has caused practical issues for the school, as the amount of students it admitted increased in the fall.</p>\n<p>“Because there was neither time nor funding to create a corresponding increase in infrastructure, we have far exceeded our resources,” she said.</p>\n<p>Several double rooms have been converted into triples, she said, and the residential lounges have been eliminated to provide more bed space, leaving students with not enough spaces to study.</p>\n<p>“This over-enrollment has not only added to the unsustainable workload of faculty and staff, but it has absolutely diminished the quality of the educational experience that the university provides,” Willats said.</p>\n<p>While concerns over growth were prevalent at the public forum, many also chose to focus on the upcoming vote on Thursday to increase tuition. President of the Council of UC Faculty Associations (CUCFA) and UCSF Professor Stanton Glantz was among several who spoke out against the decision.</p>\n<p>“I appreciate the fact that it costs money to run this place and the only real two places to get it is from the taxpayers or from the students and their families,” he said. “It’s very disappointing that you are going to be continuing Arnold Schwarzenegger’s failed policy of privatization which has generated over $12 billion in student debt since 2000.”</p>\n<p>Glantz also mentioned a report endorsed by faculty, students and staff organizations from all across UC, CSU and the community colleges that shows “the effect of the privatization and the fact that this could be fixed.” He held up the report at the public forum and encouraged that Regents use it to reform the current tuition system.</p>\n<p>Undergraduate students as well as faculty spoke at the forum. One UC Riverside undergraduate student criticized the tuition hike, saying the UC system takes pride in its “pillars of accessibility, affordability and quality” but is “sorely deficient” on all three. She said students’ wages could not be expected to cover rising costs.</p>\n<p>“If we place the burden of the cost of education on students who aren’t able to make above minimum wage on a part-time income to supplement the tuition costs that are already increasing, how do we reasonably expect any of them to be able to afford the increasing costs that you are trying to implement now?” she said.</p>\n<p>Alex Lee, the president of Associated Students of UC Davis (ASUCD), also asked the Regents to reject the proposed hike.</p>\n<p>“We as UC students are constantly the ones being harmed and taxed … I ask you, the Regents, to seek alternative sources of funding as well as maximize the money we currently have by cutting unnecessary expenses at the campus level and prioritize the educational experience,” Lee said. “On behalf of UC Davis and UC students, I ask you not to raise tuition.”</p>\n<p>In reference to tomorrow’s tuition vote, Monica Lozano, the chair of the board, said she looks forward to tomorrow’s discussion in action.</p>\n<p>The Regents plan to vote on the contentious issue of tuition hikes on Thursday morning after another session of public comment.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75244\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/regents-address-tuition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75244\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/regents-address-tuition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/regents-address-tuition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/regents-address-tuition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/regents-address-tuition/","id":2425,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2424,2423,2422],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
