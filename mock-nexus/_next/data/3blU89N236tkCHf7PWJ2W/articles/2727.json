Legal Code, which states campus organizations’ leftover funds not approved for rollover to the next fiscal year will move to the A.S. Finance and Business Committee for allocation to related causes. Senate also considered fourteen campus organizations’ requests to roll remaining funding into next year’s accounts, approving ten and denying four.</p>\n<p>College of Creative Studies (CCS) Collegiate Senator and second-year CCS physics major Liam Stanton said he opposed the bill because he feels A.S. should use funding not approved for rollover to secure its own budget, rather than be forced to use it on related causes through the A.S. Finance and Business Committee.</p>\n<p>“If we did [not pass the bill] we’d have tens of thousands of dollars, sometimes hundreds of thousands, extra and we wouldn’t have to tread water partially every year like we do,” Stanton said. “Anyone in part of A.S. that needed more money could request it and we’d be much more flexible.”</p>\n<p>College of Engineering Collegiate Senator and fourth-year mechanical engineering major Jonathan Rothschild said he was concerned the bill does not say what would happen if funds move to the A.S. Finance and Business Committee and remain unused.</p>\n<p>“I think there are some holes, specifically when these go into a specific fund for Finance Board; there is nothing saying what happens to them after the year ends,” Rothschild said.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator and second-year history of public policy major Cassie Mancini said the bill could prevent a “conflict of interest,” because A.S. will not have the option to use money denied for rollover.</p>\n<p>“It would be in our self-interest to deny rollovers, but with this we’re actually making sure that they’re put into Finance and Business,” Mancini said.</p>\n<p>College of Letters and Sciences Collegiate Senator and third-year history of public policy major Jimmy Villarreal said there could be conflict over how A.S. Finance and Business Committee allocates funds that were denied for rollover.</p>\n<p>“I could see some groups that lost their rollover come and disagree with how the Finance and Business Committee used that money, whether or not that money was used for whatever students voted that money to go towards,” Villarreal said.</p>\n<p>A.S. President and fourth-year sociology and psychology double major Ali Guthy said Senate should not easily approve campus organizations’ requests to roll over funding.</p>\n<p>“Students paid these fees for this year,” Guthy said. “We should not be setting the precedent of continuously rolling over funds, because students pay for funding this year and they need to go to students this year in services.”</p>\n<p>After much debate, senate tabled the bill indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Senate granted rollover requests to A.S. Media Center, A.S. Bike Committee, A.S. Department of Public Worms, A.S. Commission on Disability Equality, A.S. Food Bank Committee, Environmental Affairs Board, Zero Waste Committee, Take Back the Night, A.S. Office of the Controller and A.S. Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee.</p>\n<p>Campus organizations that were denied rollover requests were A.S. Elections Committee, The Bottom Line, A.S. Commission on Student Well-being and Technical Support.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Thursday, May 21, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Seikaly described what ISIL is, what they stand for, how the group came to be and the violence they have committed. Sabra discussed sectarianism, the Arab Spring and compared ISIL to the terrorist group Al-Qaeda.</p>\n<p>According to Seikaly, the terrorist group was influenced by Saddam Hussein’s authoritarian regime and developed after the United States’ invasion of Iraq. Seikaly said ISIL was not a direct result of Islamic or religious “essentialism.”</p>\n<p>“What I think is important about looking at the history of Arab authoritarianism in Iraq and in Syria and the role of U.S. intervention is understanding that ISIS is a product of historical context,” Seikaly said.</p>\n<p>Sabra said the reason for ISIL’s success in recruiting diverse followers, such as doctors and other professionals from around the world, is that the group claims to be the Islamic government left after Muhammed’s death, or the caliphate.</p>\n<p>“A significant number of people have come, for example, from Europe,” Sabra said. “There have been others who’ve come from other parts of the Arab world — Tunisia has a particularly large contingent. We don’t really know how many more people may be attracted to this movement in the long run.”</p>\n<p>According to Sabra, ISIL recruits people by posting videos about celebration and triumph in addition to their violent footage of executions.</p>\n<p>“ISIS has done a very good job of recruiting people with their slick videos — not all their videos are about violence,” Sabra said. “After they took Mosul, they had all these videos about celebration and their great victory.”</p>\n<p>Seikaly said although ISIL pledged allegiance to Al-Qaeda, the group is more than an offshoot of the militant organization: It actively looks to govern and adjudicate a community and aspires to build a state.</p>\n<p>According to Sabra, people draw false conclusions and fail to understand how ISIL developed, which leads to difficulty when attempting to solve the political problems in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>“If you know the history, it’s much easier to understand how this has happened, and to also assess the future possibilities for continuing expansion or perhaps ending this movement eventually,” Sabra said.</p>\n<p>UCSB History Club president and fourth-year history of public policy major Darren Chen said people should strive to understand the historical background of the terrorist group and understand ISIL from a different perspective.</p>\n<p>“Obviously we understand that there’s ISIS from a political science perspective, there’s ISIS from a global studies perspective, but people never really had a historical perspective. When you have a historian, it gives you a much different view,” Chen said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Thursday, May 21, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily

annual $10,000 grand prize to student tech startup Milo, a business projected to create a device that proactively monitors the blood alcohol content (BAC) of individual consumers.</p>\n<p>The NVC is hosted by the UCSB Technology Management Program, which gives entrepreneurial students and researchers on campus the opportunity to develop cutting-edge startups with expert guidance and mentorship. This year’s finalists featured augmented reality video-conferencing business Caugnate, chemotherapy diagnostics company Chemoguard, marketing analytics startup Insiight, hotel door key app Sesamo, cricket flour-producing business Slightly Nutty and the NVC winners, Milo.</p>\n<p>For the “tech-driven” award category, startups Chemoguard and Cognate split second place and Milo won first place, while Slightly Nutty and Sesamo split second place and Insiight won first place in the “market-pull” category. Milo also won the $10,000 grand prize and $2,500 People’s Choice Award, while Chemogaurd won the $5,000 Elings Prize.</p>\n<p>NVC sponsor, venture capitalist and alumnus Jason Spievak, whose software company Invoca hires mostly Gaucho graduates, said the NVC Finals present a vital opportunity for investors to discover promising young potential startups.</p>\n<p>“There’s lots of great stuff coming out of UCSB, and the depth and scope of the engineering talent here compared to when I was in school has become very impressive,” Spievak said. “From a material science perspective, it’s now the number one school in the world.”</p>\n<p>According to Spievak, the NVC develops industry and job production for the benefit of the local and global community.</p>\n<p>“Locally, it creates jobs and it keeps people in Santa Barbara, which is a win,” Spievak said. “Globally there are those occasional technologies like Integrated Fluidics that truly have the potential to save a lot of lives and change the world, and those are innovations that are happening right here on campus.”</p>\n<p>Milo member and computer science graduate student Daniel Imberman said his startup is already in talks with an incubator featuring a technology host angel, and that all his group members are interested in moving the business forward.</p>\n<p>“The high point was the second we got that first working trial,” Imberman said. “Up until then I was just kind of not sure what we were doing was going to amount to anything, but once I saw that data chart it was like, ‘Oh my god. We actually have something.’”</p>\n<p>According to Imberman, participating in the NVC has allowed him to gain knowledge and experience that transcends traditional business and technology curriculum.</p>\n<p>“I’ve learned more and worked more in the past three months than I have I the past two years,” Imberman said. “I’ve had daily 8 a.m. to midnight days. If I wasn’t in school, I was working on this all the time. Honestly even if we hadn’t won a dime I would’ve walked out with so much more business knowledge and just ready to attack the world based on this one competition.”</p>\n<p>Fourth year biochemistry major and Chemogaurd member Letitia Mueller, the only female finalist to win an award in the tech-driven category, said if her startup receives seed capital, it could “open up a whole new world of how to do chemotherapy.”</p>\n<p>“If we have a way to make chemo more effective, we could have people survive through chemo with higher dosages,” Mueller said. “If they can tolerate them or avoid the drugs they can’t tolerate, then that makes chemo more efficient and improves quality of life and reduces costs.”</p>\n<p>Mueller is one of three females to have made it to the NVC finals, along with graduate student in the Bren School of Environmental Science Megan Miranda of Slightly Nutty, who tied for the second place award in the market-pull category, and psychology graduate student Katie Koehler of Insiight, who won first place in market-pull.</p>\n<p>According to Mueller, the lack of female representation in the competition reflects an overall male-dominant trend in the tech industry that she hopes to see eliminated in years to come.</p>\n<p>“People sometimes don’t understand the gravity of the situation when you are one of the few women in your field.” Mueller said. “That being said, it’s really important for women to realize that there are so many avenues you can go down that haven’t been travelled by females. Why is the NVC 90 percent male dominated?

Rupe Debate: The Use of Genetically Modified Organisms in Food” at Campbell Hall Wednesday night to deliberate the harms and benefits of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).</p>\n<p>GMOs are living organisms whose genetic codes have been artificially manipulated through the use of various genetic engineering techniques. UC Davis plant pathology professor Pamela C. Ronald and Swiss Federal University senior scientific researcher in the Institute of Integrative Biology Angelika Hilbeck debated on whether the use of GMOs in food is safe, and the role GMOs play in world hunger and poverty. The Chronicle of Higher Education senior reporter Paul Voosen moderated the debate.</p>\n<p>IHC director and German and Slavic studies professor Susan Derwin said the use of GMOs exemplifies the idea of “Anthropocene,” or human influence on the planet.</p>\n<p>“Humans now have the ability to manipulate nature in radical ways and for their own ends,” Derwin said. “In the epic of the Anthropocene, as weather becomes more extreme and as the global population grows, the manipulation of nature promises to increase crop yields and diversify the places where food can be grown.”</p>\n<p>According to Ronald, genetic engineering is neither new nor dangerous and inventions such as “golden rice,” a strain of rice supplemented with vitamin A created through genetic engineering, can be used to combat world hunger.</p>\n<p>“After forty years of commercial use in medicine, cheeses, wine and plants, there has not been a single instance of harm to human health or the environment,” Ronald said. “Instead of worrying about the genes that are in our food … we must ask if farmers and rural communities can thrive and be sure that everyone can afford the food.”</p>\n<p>Ronald said the public’s fear of genetic engineering is due to misinformation, and is a major obstacle in distributing golden rice to rural communities.</p>\n<p>“500,000 children go blind every year because of lack of vitamin A,” Ronald said. “Half of these children will die. We have a lot of fear mongering and what really distresses me is that it is preventing this rice from reaching the children. It’s something we take for granted every day.”</p>\n<p>According to Hilbeck, hunger and vitamin A deficiency in developing countries are part of a much larger issue that genetic engineering alone cannot fix.</p>\n<p>“The kids die because they are poor. We have to address causes of hunger and poverty,” Hilbeck said. “If you don’t address the underlying causes for hunger and poverty, singling out an individual issue will not help. We are helping those kids already by giving them vitamin A pills right now.”</p>\n<p>Hilbeck said the best solution to ending world hunger and poverty is a system that can sustain itself for a long period of time.</p>\n<p>“We need the best solution, the most sustainable solution — not focus on which technology that is — I personally don’t care what technology that is,” Hilbeck said. “I want the problem to be solved, but in a system that in itself functions and works so we can have it run for hundreds of years.”</p>\n<p>Second-year chemical engineering major Christopher Nyambura said shifting industrial agriculture to a more efficient system should be the main focus.</p>\n<p>“We need to start changing the way we farm — changing the way we grow crops, meat, all these things, — before we start introducing GMOs,” Nyambura said. “People are dying, people don’t have food. That’s what we need to tackle —  people getting fed and how we can do it as efficiently as possible, as best as possible.”</p>\n<p>According to Hilbeck, debating over GMOs lead to discussions about greater topics such as industrialized agricultures and the dangers associated with it.</p>\n<p>“It’s about much more than GMOs,” Hilbeck said. “They stand in for a system that requires change and if that’s what it takes — GMOs — then that’s what it is. They trigger this debate. As long as we keep arguing, and we keep talking respectfully to each other, listening to each other and try to accommodate, we can move this place forward and progress.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of May 21, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63680\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/scientists-debate-harms-and-benefits-of-gmos/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63680\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/scientists-debate-harms-and-benefits-of-gmos/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/scientists-debate-harms-and-benefits-of-gmos/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/scientists-debate-harms-and-benefits-of-gmos/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/scientists-debate-harms-and-benefits-of-gmos/","id":2725,"author":{"id":157,"name":"Kendra Witt"},"related":[2724,2723,2722],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
