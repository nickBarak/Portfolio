His plan for a fiscal accountability task force would reallocate unused student funds for projects within A.S. and, if Dumlao follows through, could help ensure students’ money is not wasted. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>With experience working with different groups on campus and a firm set of goals for his time as president of the association, Justice Dumlao demonstrates the leadership qualities that could improve A.S. from the top down.</p>\n<p>Dumlao has served as the co-chair of the A.S. Queer Commission, diversity education coordinator for the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), a board member of the Student Affairs Student Council and a director for the Coalition for a Better UC.</p>\n<p>The candidate’s experience working in all corners of campus demonstrates his ability to communicate with both students and administration.</p>\n<p>Dumlao, a third-year global studies major, has a dedication to making A.S. more accessible to all students in a tangible way; he proposes hiring presidential liaisons from various communities on campus to work directly with his office.</p>\n<p>Dumlao also understands the importance of putting student money to good use. His plan for a fiscal accountability task force would reallocate unused student funds for projects within A.S. and, if Dumlao follows through, could help ensure students’ money is not wasted.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> is also interested in Dumlao’s idea to reform UCSB students’ healthcare.</p>\n<p>Dumlao wants Student Health to accept all major insurance providers, as he said the service currently only accepts Gaucho Health Insurance. Through Dumlao’s plan to incorporate UCSB into the UC Health system, more students will have access to Student Health services, regardless of their insurance plan.</p>\n<p>While Dumlao is an advocate for empowering student voices within the association and has long-term goals like healthcare reform, the candidate also understands the day-to-day lives of students on campus.</p>\n<p>Dumlao’s proposal to create community study spaces in the library would provide a location for students of shared majors to study and communicate, which he said will facilitate more dialogue among the student body.</p>\n<p>While vague in its implementation, Dumlao’s eagerness to create small- and large-scale change on campus is admirable in a presidential candidate, especially with a term limited to a school year.</p>\n<p>Brooke Kopel, Dumlao’s opponent running with Campus United, is qualified for the job of president with her experience as an L&amp;S senator and an apparent dedication to equality for students.</p>\n<p>Yet Kopel’s primary concrete plan for a natural disaster relief program, while well-intentioned in its structure, does not compare with Dumlao’s presentation of multiple feasible ideas and projects.</p>\n<p>Dumlao should also remember to carry himself with the dignity of his position, as his conduct in opposing ideas he disagrees with has a strong possibility of causing rifts within the organization.</p>\n<p>Dumlao has ambitious goals and a series of plans for tangible projects, but the <em>Nexus</em> would like to remind the candidate to remain inclusive of all perspectives as the leader of the student body.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 19 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82558\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/justice-dumlao-for-associated-students-president/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82558\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/justice-dumlao-for-associated-students-president/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/justice-dumlao-for-associated-students-president/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/justice-dumlao-for-associated-students-president/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/justice-dumlao-for-associated-students-president/","id":2294,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2293,2292,2291],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board","biography":"Not available","articles":[5,1792,1793,1797,1800,1810,2087,2088,2089,2090,2091,2168,2275,2281,2289,2292,2293,2294,2296,3430,3483,3684,7687],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Bright Future for Gaucho Volleyball Behind Two Surprise Freshmen Starters","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Two freshmen have impressed immediately for the UCSB women’s volleyball team, contributing in a big way.

The next closest is senior outside hitter Charlene DeHoog with 139. Additionally, Heenan is third on the team with 16 assists.</p>\n<p>“Kelly just has this cool confidence to her when she plays,” senior setter Dana Vargas said. “What makes her so special is that she doesn’t make a lot of mistakes. Coach says she has a good volleyball I.Q.”</p>\n<p>From the first time she set foot on campus, Heenan has felt right at home in Santa Barbara – on and off the court.</p>\n<p>“I love it here,” Heenan said. “Everyone on the team has been really great and it’s been awesome to make an immediate impact.”</p>\n<p>Success is nothing new for the 5’8” defensive specialist from Costa Mesa. Heenan’s list of high school accolades is not a short one; as a senior at Newport Harbor High School she led her team to a state championship while receiving First team All-Orange County honors and was named a Top-250 preseason All-American.</p>\n<p>“I know how much hard work needs to be put in to be the best,” Heenan said. “The work ethic on this team is unbelievable.”</p>\n<p>Freshman outside hitter Kara Sherrard has a bit of a different story of her road to the starting outside hitter position. Asked to walk onto the team last year, Sherrard’s chances of starting were bleak.</p>\n<p>“Kara was obviously someone I wanted on the team, but [I] did not expect her to start for us,” Gregory said. “Over summer, she started to get stronger and stronger and to really commit herself to improving.”</p>\n<p>In Santa Barbara’s first match of the season on the road against UC Berkeley, sophomore outside hitter Leah Sully tore her ACL, leaving Sherrard as her replacement.</p>\n<p>“It’s always extremely unfortunate when a player is injured, but sometimes when one door closes, another one opens,” Gregory said. “Kara has been great for us.”</p>\n<p>The freshman entered her game and made an immediate impact, blocking a kill attempt on her first play.</p>\n<p>“It’s been unbelievable,” Sherrard said. “I just wanted to come in and play consistently for the team.”</p>\n<p>The 6’0” outside hitter has started every match since then. She ranks 2nd on the team with 340 total attacks her 95 kills are good for 3rd. Sherrard is also 4th on the team with 11 assists and is tied for 3rd with seven service aces.</p>\n<p>“Kara has come in and really stepped up to the plate,” Vargas said. “Her role is to be steady and defend, and she has stepped up to the plate when her number has been called.”</p>\n<p>Sherrard’s toughness may be her most impressive attribute. In a tournament game at the USD Invitational against Minnesota, Sherrard suffered a sprained ankle. Carried off the court, it seemed as if she would not return. However, Gregory put her back into the game in the second half.</p>\n<p>“I really feel like part of the team,” Sherrard said. “It raises my confidence level knowing that Coach has that much confidence in me.”</p>\n<p>Hailing from Lancaster, Sherrard led Quartz Hill High School to consecutive undefeated Golden League seasons. As a senior, she was named the Golden League Player of the Year, and earned First team All-CIF Southern Section honors.</p>\n<p>“The biggest thing [about Heenan and Sherrard] is that they believe in themselves and they know our coaches believe in them,” Gregory said.</p>\n<p>The pair of freshman has been doing its best work as of late. In Santa Barbara’s last three games — all wins — both Hennan and Sherrard have been fantastic. In the Gauchos’ 3-2 win over SDSU at the USD Invitational, Heenan set a season-high with 26 digs.</p>\n<p>“My success is really a product of the team’s,” Heenan said. “It’s good to know that all of the players are out there to support one another and lift each other up.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos opened up league play emphatically at the end of August, posting two straight road wins over Cal State Northridge and UC Irvine, before beating Long Beach State to begin Big West play 3-0.</p>\n<p>As has been the case all season, both Heenan and Sherrard impressed. In Santa Barbara’s win over Northridge, Heenan collected a team-high 19 digs, while Sherrard delivered 11 kills to lead UCSB to the hard-fought victory, 3-2.</p>\n<p>Against Irvine, the story was the same. Heenan led Santa Barbara with 16 digs, while Sherrard collected a double-double with 11 kills and 13 digs to help the Gauchos shut out the Anteaters 3-0.</p>\n<p>In Santa Barbara’s comeback win over Long Beach State, Heenan recorded a team-high 21 digs, while Sherrard posted another double-double with 15 kills and 10 digs.</p>\n<p>“This season has been a little bit surreal so far,” Sherrard said. “I wasn’t expecting to be playing at all this season, so it’s awesome to be helping the team out at all.”</p>\n<p>In the team’s latest victory, the freshman duo stepped up for the Gauchos once again. Sherrard had 16 kills and 14 blocks and Heenan tied for a team-high with 14 digs to lead to Gauchos to victory over Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is now 10-8 overall and 4-1 in Big West league play. UCSB will take to the court next this weekend when it faces Pacific and UC Davis on the road. As vital members of the squad, both Heenan and Sherrard will have to perform if the Gauchos are to continue their early season success.</p>\n<p>“Both of these girls are fantastic players,” Gregory said. “They have been great for us and I only expect them to get better.”</p>\n<p>Heenan, Sherrard and the rest of the squad will face Big West foe Pacific in Stockton on Oct. 15 at 7 p.m.</p><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Sophia Dycaico has been involved in the community since her freshman year, working as a community coordinator for the then-external vice president of local affairs, taking an active role campaigning for local self-governance efforts and being a serviceable helping hand to campus organizations as a student senator.</p>\n<p>If Dycaico can focus her organizing efforts on finding real-world solutions to the numerous problems affecting I.V., including safety and police presence, then her experience and knowledge of the community’s history will make her an effective EVPLA next year.</p>\n<p>The EVPLA is the executive A.S. representative for all things Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>As a first-year history of public policy major, Dycaico helped Third District Supervisor candidate Joan Hartmann register voters in the community. In the spring, she worked as the Community Services District (CSD) coordinator for the EVPLA office, months before the CSD became a reality.</p>\n<p>Dycaico spent that fall going door to door, asking people to vote on measures that would create both the district and a tax to fund it. She helped host a forum, held by the EVPLA office, featuring CSD Board of Directors candidates. Many of those candidates ended up on the board, but the CSD didn’t get its funding. This June, it will have another chance, and Dycaico is again campaigning for it.</p>\n<p>Since then, Dycaico has hunkered down on campus efforts. She was elected off-campus senator last spring. During her term, she is most proud of having been an effective liaison between the Senate and organizations like Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) and UCSB Lobby Corps.</p>\n<p>Rena Bahl, EAB co-chair, agreed Dycaico was a viable liaison who attended 75 percent of the org’s meetings — more than she was required to by A.S. legal code.</p>\n<p>“She did a lot more than she was supposed to and put in way more effort than previous liaisons,” said Bahl, a third-year environmental studies and global studies major.</p>\n<p>During her <em>Nexus</em> endorsement interview, Dycaico proved she has a solid level of background knowledge of I.V.’s workings. She’s aware of current CSD projects and other I.V. fixtures like the Beloved Community conference and the I.V. Recreation and Parks District. Dycaico has formed opinions on tenant-landlord mediation and making Halloween safer.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Dycaico’s ideas for improving I.V. could use further work. Combatting I.V.’s burglary rates, she said, starts with giving its residents more replacement keys for their houses because too many are leaving their homes unlocked.</p>\n<p>Dycaico’s plan fails to consider that The Home Depot is only a 13-minute bicycle ride away from the southernmost block of I.V.</p>\n<p>Dycaico also introduced nothing new when it comes to engaging I.V.’s non-student population, including families and residents who do not speak English as a first language.</p>\n<p>Still, when it comes to understanding the projects already underway in I.V. and the bureaucratic tangles that may slow them down, Dycaico is the right candidate for the job. If she can get to know more of the folks in the community this summer and commit herself to understanding how they would like to be helped, Dycaico would do a fair job of representing the student population in I.V.</p>\n<p>Students can vote for Dycaico in the A.S. Elections by logging on to G.O.L.D. from April 23-26.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 19 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div
