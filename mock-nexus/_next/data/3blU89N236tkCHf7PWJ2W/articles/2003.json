All the gains we had won in our contract for [postdoctorates] like higher salaries, a very good benefits plan, paid parental leave, protections against sexual [harassment] and discrimination, job security </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we lost all of these in the transition,” Sweeney said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When forming a union, ARU obtained the signatures needed for a super majority and submitted them to the state labor board in September 2018. After some initial delays, bargaining officially began in May 2019 and has been going on ever since, Sweeney said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re calling on UC to work quickly to bargain a fair contract that will ensure sustainable research careers and a more equitable, inclusive workplace,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond job security and improved pay, ARs are bargaining for protections against harassment and discrimination in the workplace, along with gender equity and inclusion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Especially in STEM fields, which most researchers are in, there’s a gender gap,” Sweeney explained. “Having these kinds of protections, like parental leave for example, has been shown to increase retention of women because women aren’t forced to choose between their career and having a family.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While delaying the contract “might seem to benefit the university,” Sweeney believes that improving the conditions for ARs at the UCs will ultimately benefit the UC more in the long run. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a connection between having better working conditions and doing better work,” he said. “When people feel more secure in their jobs, when they feel like there’s protections from [harassment] and discrimination, when they’re paid at a fair level, they can do better research.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elisa Smith, media relations representative in the UC Office of the President, said the office is “working hard to negotiate a fair agreement with the academic researchers as quickly as possible.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since this is a brand new contract, it takes some time to reach agreement as we do not have a prior bargaining agreement to work from, and considerable thought and discussion are required in chartering new territory with unique issues,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Sept. 26, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Kundu wrote a scathing response, and, not knowing what to do with his paper, began sending it to various professors at several American universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To his surprise, some professors got back to him and liked what he had written. At the end of a reply, one professor even invited Kundu to apply for graduate school and study under him in the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That professor was Mattison Mines, who taught anthropology at UCSB from 1970 to 2005. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I pinched myself,” Kundu said, recalling the invitation from Mines. “He is my guru.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Kundu arrived in Santa Barbara for graduate school in 1982, he was primarily interested in the modernization of agriculture, population studies and the Green Revolution in India.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until Kundu was fully immersed in the environmental studies circles at UCSB that he began to see the darker sides of what he was studying — how human behavior and modern agriculture were negatively affecting the environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Mankind’s] connection to environmental degradation … I had no idea until I came here. At the time, that conversation was not happening in India. Everyone was still thinking of how good the Green Revolution was, thinking they had found the solution,” Kundu said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the late 1980s, nearing the completion of his Ph.D., Kundu applied for a lecturer position in the environmental studies department and was subsequently accepted. However, he realized that he hadn’t quite considered the dilemma of whether to return to India or stay in the United States. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had no interest in leaving India permanently. My parents were there, my in-laws, my wife. But I couldn’t leave Santa Barbara either. I fell in love. It is this lifelong love with this campus, its students, its faculty members.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To resolve his problem, Kundu worked out a deal with the department to teach only a couple quarters a year, eventually transitioning to only teaching in the summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu’s first official quarter teaching at UCSB was the winter of 1988. He hasn’t stopped since. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This summer marks his 32nd consecutive year of returning to Santa Barbara from India to teach both environmental studies and anthropology classes including Environmental Studies 132: Human Behavior and Global Environment and Anthropology 148: Ecological Anthropology.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu’s interest in anthropology and the environment began in ninth grade after he attended a village boarding school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There, I came to know the villagers, the farmers. I was born in a city and I had never seen a paddy field before,” Kundu said. “I noticed that these families had a different culture, and I became interested in their lives, the farmers’ lives. It made a deep impact on me.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu was one of the early scholars to approach environmental studies from an anthropological perspective, looking at how the development of human societies and cultures is affecting the environment today. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu wants students to understand that “our own consumption is at the root of the environmental crisis,” noting that during a flight from Japan to the U.S., he received a bottle of water from the Swiss Alps. He lamented the use of resources required to bring the water from Switzerland to Japan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What is the purpose? Was there water scarcity in Japan? I did some research, and no, there’s no water scarcity. The airline wanted to show that they cared about us or something like that. Yet what is the impact? Unless we understand this, we will not be able to change it. Technology is only part of the solution. We need a behavioral solution as well. A change in perspective. That is my key message for students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year biological anthropology major Ana Perez, who is currently taking Anthropology 148: Ecological Anthropology with Kundu, said she appreciates the substance and methodology of Professor Kundu’s teaching.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “When he talked about being one of the first people to actually consider putting environmental studies and anthropology together… I didn’t even think of putting those two together. I hope that more people taking his classes decide to pursue environmental anthropology,” Perez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s awesome that he travels the world for this, and I wish more people had the opportunity to take his courses.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Kundu is grateful for his unique career, it is not without downsides. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you have two homes, you are always homesick,” Kundu said. While in Santa Barbara, it is hard not to miss his wife and family in India. However, he said that friends like Debjani Bhattacharya, a financial analyst at UCSB’s Earth Research Institute, help with that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Really, wherever you go outside of India, there will be an Indian diaspora. We met here 17 years ago through a group of friends,” Bhattacharya said. It just so happened that the two were born and raised in the same state in India, West Bengal, and attended the same university for their undergraduate studies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we go back to India, we visit each other’s families, and we have become family friends.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two friends, along with other colleagues, like to get together to cook traditional Indian meals and take walks on Del Playa Drive. Once, during an evening Del Playa walk, some students approached their group and asked Kundu if he was the chancellor of UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without skipping a beat, Kundu replied, “Not yet.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for what the future holds for Kundu, he welcomes more of the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Teaching is my religion.

The two are currently in contact with the UCSB American Indian Student Association to “get their input on the situation” and “[see] what exactly my office can do to help them,” Beasley said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the backlash against TMT, Beasley maintains that the project will go on “with or without Chancellor Yang’s involvement,” but has hope in the power of student activism and its potential to stunt the UC’s role in the project.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The main solution would just be to come together and to really listen to the indigenous communities here and over in Hawaii,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s beauty in activism and students using their voices because it gets things done.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada could not be immediately reached for comment.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Sept. 26, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

pattern of repeated harassment and retaliation, violating the California Whistleblower Protection Act – an act that prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who report violations of the law – several times over.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other four other lawsuits filed against the department, </span><a

All of these lawsuits also allege violations of the Whistleblower Act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stern’s complaint stems from the alleged ignoring of several reported cases of misconduct that began in late 2015, and is mainly centered around five other officers: former Officer Josh Rothermel, former Officer Jeff Savaglio, former Officer Ryan Smith, Officer David Millard and Officer Amanda Siegel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the lawsuit, Stern says he raised concerns about two fellow officers – Rothermel and Savaglio, who are also mentioned in the other lawsuits – in late 2015, alleging they were “causing safety risks” by not responding to requests for backup, turning off radios and not answering phone calls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After speaking with the two about his concerns, Stern alleges he was approached by Smith, who told him that Stern’s concerns about Rothermel and Savaglio were “not valid” and threatened to write him up for “speaking with an officer under Smith’s command.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This would mark the first of several interactions with Smith regarding officer misconduct; beginning June 2016, Stern alleges Smith gave Rothermel, Savaglio and Siegel preferential treatment. Additionally, as detailed in other suits, Siegel was alleged to be having an extramarital affair with Smith. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stern said that any attempt to address concerns with the three’s behavior – Rothermel and Savaglio’s alleged safety risks and Siegel’s capabilities as an officer – was met with threats from Smith to write Stern up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Less than a year later, in February 2017, Stern alleges he was accused by outside investigators looking into the department of knowing about Rothermel and Savaglio’s “improper conduct,” but failing “to notify a proper supervisor.” He then informed investigators that he had reported the two officers’ conduct to Smith and that Smith had allegedly threatened him in response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the following months, Stern says he was demoted from his position as corporal “without any explanation,” was not chosen for another qualified position and was excluded from receiving an award for his actions during the </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2017/02/01/milo-yiannopoulos-event-canceled-violent-protests-erupt-uc-berkeley/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley riots</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and during the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-15/santa-barbara-community-mourns-lives-lost-in-montecito-mudslides/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Montecito mudslides</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. According to court documents, Stern believes this was because he told investigators about Smith’s alleged misconduct. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from complaints about Smith, Stern also lists several allegations against his superior Millard – who is named as a defendant in the suit, alongside the UC Regents – in court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Stern, Millard allegedly lied on a university audit, ordered a dispatcher to lie to a member of the public, mismanaged the release of a trainee officer, “lacked leader and management abilities” and “refused to address issues related to retaliation against officers who made protected disclosures.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stern additionally alleges that on Aug. 19, 2018, after he reported to Millard that other UCPD officers were “legitimately in fear of Smith,” Millard dismissed Stern’s concerns and refused to “address harassment concerns of his fellow officers.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Millard, like Smith, is also named in the other recent UCPD lawsuits. Stern and the plaintiffs of the other lawsuits accuse Millard of covering for Smith, Savagalio and Rothermel’s behavior. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith has not worked with the UCPD since December 2017; he filed his own lawsuit under the pseudonym John Doe against the department in March 2019, alleging that he was harassed and retailed against by his fellow officers for reporting a number of behaviors within the department. His suit detailed alleged police mockery of Chancellor Henry T. Yang, fellow officers and sexual assault and rape victims by members of the department, as well as racial discrimination and the falsification of sexual assault reports.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stern is being represented by the same lawyers representing the Littles, Signa and Reyes. He is scheduled to appear in court again in December. </span></p>\n<p>“Officer Stern filed for the same reasons his fellow officers have, because the UCSBPD and UC Regents fostered an environment of endemic discrimination,” Stern’s lawyer Antonio Castillo said in an email.</p>\n<p>“He filed because it’s long overdue that the UCSB and UC Regents take responsibility for the harm they allowed to occur.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
