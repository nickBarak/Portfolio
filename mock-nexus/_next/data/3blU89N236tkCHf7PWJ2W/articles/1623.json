Friday night is going to be one of those eventful nights as the UCSB men’s soccer team is set to face Stanford at Harder Stadium where record crowds are expected.<br>\nTraditionally, the first soccer home game after students move in is always a must-go event. This year is no exception as the Gauchos take on a prominent opponent in the Cardinal, and all of campus is abuzz in anticipation of Friday night’s match.<br>\n“Everyone is fired up for this game,” senior midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “Anytime we have a game at Harder Stadium it’s like we have this switch on. We receive most of our energy from the crowd.”<br>\nEntering the contest with a 4-3 record, UCSB must face a tough Stanford squad (4-1-1 on the season) that is set to spoil what looks to be one of the marquee matchups for the Gauchos this season.<br>\nThe last time UCSB faced such a well-known team on the first game following student move in was back in 2010 when the Gauchos set an NCAA on-campus record with 15,896 fans in attendance in a 2-0 victory against UCLA. Record crowds make sense when factoring in that UCSB has led the nation in attendance for six consecutive seasons.<br>\n“Friday is a huge game for us, and it’s one of the games that we need to have to keep our season going forward,” Baiden said. “Looking back on the UCLA game, it was really, really great to play under that crowd and it gives us that extra edge to go extra hard and play well. It’s going to be good for us in terms of energy, in terms of confidence, in terms of giving it all on the field.”                                                  Despite falling to New Mexico 1-0 and allowing a goal with 12 seconds left to play in overtime, the Gauchos are playing well and that all starts on the defensive side of the ball. Baiden stars alongside a trio of senior defenders in Peter Schmetz, Daniel Welsh and Matt Glodack to form a stingy backline that has allowed seven goals in seven games this season.<br>\nWith freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely in between the posts, UCSB’s defense has allowed one goal each of the last four games, with McNeely allowing a mere four goals in five starts.<br>\nWhile defense has been key for the Gauchos, the offensive production has seen rocky moments at times this season. Despite the efforts of a pair of seniors in forward Achille Campion and Goffin Boyoko, the Gaucho offense has failed to score in three separate occasions, the team’s only losses of the year. Campion and Boyoko are tied for the team lead in goals with three apiece.<br>\n“We have five freshmen who have been starting. We lost a lot of the goals that were scored last year, those players graduated or became professional players,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We’re having to find a different way of scoring this year and it has just taken some time. The younger players have gotten better every single game and we’re hoping that our seniors start to become consistently dangerous in front of the net.”<br>\nStanford, meanwhile, has won four straight, allowing one goal during that span. The Cardinal are led by senior goalkeeper Drew Hutchins who has allowed six goals in six starts, and are paced on the offensive end by junior forward Zach Batteer, as he has scored an impressive four of Stanford’s nine goals.<br>\nEven when considering Stanford’s talent on both sides of the ball, UCSB seems less dependent on talent and more so on energy that will fuel the team’s confidence entering Friday night.<br>\n“There’s just very few events that happen at UCSB where everyone can show up to one place,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s the one event where everyone at UCSB can come out and throw on a yellow shirt and cheer on our team. I think that makes the event special, it’s what makes UCSB special.”<br>\nOne thing is clear about the UCSB men’s soccer team entering Friday night. They want every single member of the UCSB community in attendance when they take the field against Stanford. It is, after all, another chance to make history.<br>\n“This is one of those moments where everyone can come together and cheer for our school and cheer for us to win the game. I would basically tell everyone don’t miss it,” Vom Steeg said. “Anyone who was at the UCLA game three years ago probably wishes there were more events like that because obviously that was a real special night. You want to be a part of that.”<br>\nFriday’s epic match is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. at Harder.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 8 of September 26, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cedar Lay of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52051\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/friday-night-its-going-to-be-loco/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52051\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/friday-night-its-going-to-be-loco/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/friday-night-its-going-to-be-loco/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/friday-night-its-going-to-be-loco/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/friday-night-its-going-to-be-loco/","id":1623,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1622,1621,1620],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[254,318,354,366,518,519,527,533,535,538,539,546,548,551,554,555,558,561,567,570,574,576,577,578,589,592,594,596,605,609,613,618,623,630,633,638,640,647,650,651,653,654,656,660,661,668,670,673,677,683,694,700,703,706,708,710,717,719,724,727,798,809,814,828,833,847,849,851,853,854,856,857,858,863,867,868,870,874,877,879,880,882,884,886,887,889,892,894,899,900,902,904,905,915,920,1259,1565,1566,1567,1568,1569,1570,1571,1575,1578,1581,1583,1584,1587,1590,1591,1594,1599,1601,1603,1606,1607,1608,1611,1623,1626,1652,1666,1668,1669,1670,1674,1675,1685,1689,1691,1692,1697,1762,1763,1765,2063,2069,2095,2142,2158,3169,3185,3190,3226,3229,3231,3232,3238,3244,3249,3256,4448,4494,4522,4523,4524,4526,4531,4539,4541,4544,4545,4546,4549,4550,4551,4554,4567,5189,5193,5194,5209,5396,5399,5400,5402,5403,5404,5405,5406,5407,5409,5417,5418,5419,5420,5421,5422,5423,5424,5425,5426,5427,5428,5429,5430,5431,5436,5448,5449,5450,5502,5530,5536],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Brings In 14 for 2013 Recruiting Class","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Despite losing only three seniors from last year’s team, the UCSB women’s soccer team will welcome 14 new players for its 2013 recruiting class.

Following a season where the team struggled putting the ball in the back of the net, the Gauchos add depth to their squad with versatile players at each position, primarily forward.</p>\n<p>“Part of the reason we have such a big recruiting class is because we felt we had to make some changes,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “There are a couple young ladies [coming in] that do score a pretty good number of goals for their high school teams and for their club team.”</p>\n<p>Headlining the class is a pair of teammates from San Ramon Valley High School, forward Morgan Idso and forward/defender Makenna Kummer. The two bring athleticism up top for the Gauchos and provide big targets inside the box with their size. In their senior year, the two combined for 10 goals and led their team to the CIF North Coast Section Tournament.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“They’re really good ball strikers. Morgan specifically has one of these knacks; when she shoots, it’s going on frame hard,” Stumpf said. “Makenna is going to be a more wide-striker type that’s going to deliver the balls.”</p>\n<p>Along with Idso and Kummer, forward/midfield Ashley Dean from Yucaipa High School and center midfielder McKinsey Martinez from Rancho Cucamonga High School have the potential to start right away as strikers for the Gauchos in the upcoming season.</p>\n<p>Dean gives UCSB a left-footed threat capable of scoring and is able to play multiple positions, most notably as an outside back that gets forward. Martinez, although undersized, provides another aerial threat for the Gauchos. Besides the ability to shoot, her playmaking abilities in the midfield makes another versatile player on the field, as she finished her senior season with six assists.</p>\n<p>“We had trouble scoring goals and these are all forwards we really feel they’re going to come in and challenge for starting spots right away,” Stumpf said. “If not that, they’re going to be the first ones coming off the bench.”</p>\n<p>Although three starters from the backline will be returning this season, the Gauchos will benefit from the arrival of Coto de Caza native Kailey Hackett from Santa Margarita Catholic High School. The central defender/sweeper also has the chance for competing for a starting position right away because of her defensive prowess on the pitch. As a senior she won a pair of titles and was selected as First Team All-CIF.</p>\n<p>Last year, the Gauchos only managed to score more than one goal twice in nine conference games.

Losing our forwards, it was huge to have someone to score goals for us.”</p>\n<p>Ryan seemed to come up with a goal whenever his team needed one. Against Cal Poly Oct. 19, he scored what may have been the most beautiful goal of the year for UCSB when he converted a diving header sent into the box from freshman midfielder Ema Boateng.</p>\n<p>He even single-handedly kept the Gauchos in the game on multiple occasions. Most notably, he scored both of UCSB’s goals in a 2-1 decision against UC Irvine Oct. 5, the second goal coming in double overtime with 24 seconds remaining.</p>\n<p>“Every goal he got was a key goal at a key moment,” Vom Steeg said. “You can’t ask for much more than what he gave us. I feel bad that we weren’t able to do enough to send [our seniors] off in a different away.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the San Jose native seemed to fly under the radar with the hype of the team centering on flashy players such as Boateng or senior midfielder Dion Acoff, who dazzled fans with their speed and footwork.</p>\n<p>Yet, that’s not the type of player Ryan is; he’s a player who effectively gets the job done. He knows where to be on the field, and most importantly, how to finish in front of the goal.</p>\n<p>“He understands the game really well and he knows where to be at the right time,” Baiden said. “It allowed him to get involved more and get himself in places that would score.”</p>\n<p>Despite being a player who hasn’t received a ton of publicity or made people talk, Ryan was recognized in a big way when he received the Big West Midfielder of the Year award last week.</p>\n<p>“It’s nice to get an award after a difficult season,” Ryan said. “It was definitely one of my goals to try to be the best midfielder out there and getting it felt like a [big] accomplishment. It’s definitely a big award, and I’m proud of it.”</p>\n<p>One of two players to play in every game this year for UCSB, Ryan tallied five goals and two assists during Big West play en route to his first All-Big West honor of his career.</p>\n<p>“In order to win that award, you have to play through the midfield, and we do that,” Vom Steeg said. “We ask them to be on the ball, and as a result, we allow them to really demonstrate what they can do. He seized the opportunity.”</p>\n<p>Ryan keeps the Midfielder of the Year award in the family as he is the fourth consecutive Gaucho to win it. Danny Barrera took the honor in 2009-10 and Luis Silva won it last year.</p>\n<p>In fact, playing behind players such as Barrera, Silva and Sam Garza in the first three years of his career might be the reason you had never really heard Ryan’s name before.</p>\n<p>“I had really good players in front of me like Silva and Danny, so I had to let them do their thing,” Ryan said. “They had a lot of success. I knew I could have that role.”</p>\n<p>This year, the team needed somebody to step up and take the role of that dominant midfielder. It was a role Ryan wanted and took into his own hands.</p>\n<p>“It was definitely a change in mentality,” Ryan said. “I wanted to be that player to get the goal or the assist. This year, I felt like I was the guy — that one midfielder — that had to score for us to win.”</p>\n<p>This year, Ryan took 26 shots, 11 more than he took in his first three years combined. His 19 points are also exceptionally greater than his contribution in the first three years when he tallied just five points, including two goals.</p>\n<p>“He played with a lot of confidence this year,” Vom Steeg said. “That’s the most dramatic change from last year. Once we started to lose our forwards, he took it upon himself to score. I think there was a lot of leadership too. Even though he doesn’t scream and yell, he demanded the ball and stepped up his play in the bigger games.”</p>\n<p>UCSB also made a tactical change, moving Ryan into a central midfield position this year. The position was better suited for Ryan than his original outside mid position and gave him more scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>“Before I got to UCSB, I always played attacking mid, so I was comfortable with that role,” Ryan said. “Usually on the outside, you concentrate on getting the cross off and since I was in the middle [this year], I was in the box and receiving the ball at the end of the cross.”</p>\n<p>Now, Ryan’s season and career as a Gaucho are done. But like the great players who played at UCSB before him, there may be a spot for him at the pro level.</p>\n<p>For Ryan, going pro has been a lifelong dream. He’s strived for this goal all his life, as his dad was a professional soccer player (a midfielder) for the San Jose Earthquakes. At UCSB, Ryan wore No. 14, just like his dad.</p>\n<p>“[My dad’s] probably been the number one influence soccer-wise that I’ve had in my life,” Ryan said. “He brought me up with the game. He was always my coach until I went to UCSB. I [went] to his games and [grew] up with his soccer friends and [watched] soccer with him all the time. He took a lot of time out of his day to help me develop as a player, so I owe a lot to him.”</p>\n<p>The next step for Ryan will be receiving an invitation to the MLS combine, where coaches will take a look at the college seniors. To get drafted, participating in this combine is a must.</p>\n<p>“You would hope as the midfielder of the year he can get that invitation,” Vom Steeg said. “I definitely think he can play at the next level. He makes good decisions on the ball and he’s good around the net, so I think Nic can help a team at the next level; but it’s whether somebody can appreciate that, because he’s not a player that will make an incredible move and make people go ‘wow.’ Because of him, though, your team will play better.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 10 of November 14th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48920\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ryan-takes-reins-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48920\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ryan-takes-reins-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ryan-takes-reins-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ryan-takes-reins-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ryan-takes-reins-2/","id":1620,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1619,1618,1617],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Returning to Top Form","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/M-Soccer-File-Photo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/M-Soccer-File-Photo.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"After going 11 games to start the season without losing and earning a national ranking as high as No. 3, the UCSB men’s soccer team fell to Cal State Northridge Oct. 7.

Santa Barbara finished last in the North Division of the Big West, compiling a losing Big West record for the first time since 1991 and failing to make the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 11 seasons.</p>\n<p>“At one point in the season, we were 8-0-2 and it felt like we were in a really good position to not only make a playoff run but to compete for national championship,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Then, over the course of three weekends we started to lose players (to injury). We lost Campion, Schmetz and then it went from there. By the last game of the season, we had seven starters from the start of the year out.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The team loses six seniors to graduation this year, including midfielders Machael David and Nic Ryan. David was known for his control on the ball as defensive midfielder, but also tallied 10 assists during his career.</p>\n<p>Ryan, the reigning Big West Midfielder of the Year, led UCSB and ranked third in the Big West in goals with eight.</p>\n<p>“We lose a group of players which had been four-year key contributors,” Vom Steeg said. “We definitely lose some key players out of our midfield, but the fact is that it’s not as much about what you lose as what you return.”</p>\n<p>With the majority of the team still intact and seven starters returning, UCSB will look to continue its excellence as one of the country’s premier soccer programs next season. To help, UCSB brings in a big recruiting class composed of eight freshmen and four transfers.</p>\n<p>Headlining UCSB’s recruiting class are forward Reed McKenna and defender Isaiah Trejo, who are already at UCSB and played with the Gauchos during their spring season.</p>\n<p>“Both these players are expected to contribute right away, which is why we brought them here in spring,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re very familiar with both these recruits because these are players we recruited out of high school.”</p>\n<p>McKenna will fill a big weakness of UCSB’s from last season, which was putting the ball in the back of the net. The junior comes to UCSB after two seasons at UCLA and is a former No. 2-ranked Southern California player.</p>\n<p>“Last year when we started to lose our players to injury, we just stopped scoring goals,” Vom Steeg said. “Reed McKenna will go a long way toward filling that void. We need somebody to play with Campion, who had the ability to score 12 or 13 goals, so that’s why Reed is an important player to our team.”</p>\n<p>Trejo, a Clovis, CA native, returns to California after two years at Louisville. As a result, Trejo comes with lots of experience, playing for a program that competed for the national championship two years ago.</p>\n<p>“Trejo is an attacking wide player that can play in back,” Vom Steeg said. “We’ve always had that player that can come out of the back and attack wide. Trejo will give us the ability to attack out of the back.”</p>\n<p>Another transfer for UCSB is midfielder Adis Islamovic from Southern Polytechnic State University. There, he led his team to a 2012 NAIA Elite Eight appearance, earning second-team All-SSAC while tallying nine goals and five assists during the season.</p>\n<p>“[Adis] is a very good player who was unable to come here directly out of high school. He decided to go play a year in Germany,” Vom Steeg said. “He is an attacking midfielder. With the players we lost in David, Ryan and Josue Madueno, he is a player that can fill in that role.”</p>\n<p>As for the freshmen, three players that could make an immediate impact are goalkeeper Josh McNeely and midfielders Drew Murphy and Nick DePuy.</p>\n<p>McNeely has played for both the Los Angeles Galaxy Academy and the U.S. Soccer Development Academy. He was also a starter for the 2011 U.S. Soccer Academy National Championship team. With senior André Grandt graduating, McNeely fills the gap of a second goalkeeper.</p>\n<p>UCSB also brings in a teammate of McNeely’s from the Los Angeles Galaxy Academy, Drew Murphy. While playing with the Galaxy, Murphy also trained with the MLS Champion first team and was a member of the 2011 U.S. Soccer Academy’s National Championship team.</p>\n<p>“We’ll have to see which of the freshmen are able to step up to this level and that’s a little bit hard to tell,” Vom Steeg said. “I think we are particularly high on those that are playing at a high level (right now). The two players we have playing for the Galaxy, Josh and Drew, are two players because of where they’re playing right now at one of the top, if not the top club team in the country, so you might expect that they could contribute right away.”</p>\n<p>Finally, Nick DePuy becomes a Gaucho after earning the co-captain spot for Real Colorado, which went to the 2011 Region IV Quarterfinals and the Colorado State Championship. In addition, at Regis Jesuit High, DePuy led the team in goals and earned All-State and All-Conference honors.</p>\n<p>“[Nick’s] another midfielder who we feel has played at a high level and could contribute in the midfield,” Vom Steeg said. “We have a group of midfielders that we’re bringing in, so along with [Fifi Baiden], the big question going into the fall will be who plays in those other two or three spots based on who we play?”</p>\n<p>The slew of incoming players for UCSB will join seven returning starters next season, including 2012 all-Big West First Team member Baiden and the Big West Freshman of the Year, Ema Boateng.</p>\n<p>“What we are returning is basically seven starters and six of them are seniors,” Vom Steeg said. “There’s a lot to be excited about in terms of what’s returning.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will start their season August 24 against Westmont, marking the beginning of an exciting preseason schedule that includes teams such as Penn, UCLA and Yale.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 15th’s edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Daily Nexus File Photo</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51390\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-15/returning-to-top-form/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51390\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-15/returning-to-top-form/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-15/returning-to-top-form/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-15/returning-to-top-form/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-15/returning-to-top-form/","id":1622,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1621,1620,1619],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
