the CDPH reports to the CDC, which then reports to the World Health Organization, Javanbakht said. The chain of command, however, is not a strict hierarchy, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a student exhibits coronavirus symptoms, Javanbakht said the university would notify the SB County Public Health Department about the potential case, which will advise Student Health as to whether or not to test the individual based on “how suspicious” their case is or the likelihood that they may have coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it’s a pretty suspicious [case], then the next step is, ‘Okay, who else could have been exposed?’ And if it’s a student, that [case] comes back to us,” Javanbakht said. “And if that student’s symptoms are in line with the guidelines, that’s someone that we need to test.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But students don’t always go straight to Student Health, Javanbakht said. It’s up to the SB County Public Health Department to notify Student Health if a student exhibits symptoms somewhere else, such as at a local emergency room or urgent care, he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Student Health and the SB County Public Health Department reasonably suspect that a student may have coronavirus, the public health department will work to pin down who they’ve been in contact with in the past two weeks to “expand that circle,” according to Javanbakht.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an example, Javanbakht said the SB County Public Health Department would calculate the risk a potentially infected student posed to their classmates by sending someone to campus to survey the features of classroom spaces, including looking at the room’s dimensions and the space between tables or desks to determine which students may have been exposed if a student had coronavirus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, Javanbakht said Student Health would work with the registrar’s office to find people who were potentially exposed to coronavirus and would let them know that “they might need to be tested.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a student does test positive for coronavirus, Javanbakht said the SB County Public Health Department would contact individuals who were “close enough to be exposed” and instruct them to isolate themselves and “find their own room separate from everyone else.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For people who had a low-risk exposure, Javanbakht said they could still go about their day but said that it was important to report symptoms as soon as possible, because “then we need to intervene.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If UCSB runs out of space to house exposed students, Javanbakht said the SB County Public Health Department will provide the university with additional space. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of that, UCSB and Isla Vista are notorious for their often-cramped living situations, so “if people are in close quarters,” Javanbakht said, “that’s absolutely a factor.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This stuff tends to live on surfaces, and if you have a lot of people close [to each other] touching the common surfaces, yeah, the risk tends to be higher than someone who’s out on a farm by themselves,” he added, stressing the importance of keeping good hygiene.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To keep the campus community informed about the coronavirus, Student Health has sent a number of emails to the student body in the past two months to quell concerns and provide updates on potential cases. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Behind the scenes, Javanbakht said Student Health has reached out to campus entities that deal with a high volume of students, such as the Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises, the Department of Recreation and the University Library, to detail hygiene methods that can decrease the spread of coronavirus on campus, such as using hand sanitizer and reminding students to wash their hands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a Feb. 13 emergency operations meeting, a number of campus representatives met to discuss a potential response to coronavirus cases on campus, with each representative giving feedback on what resources they could provide in case of an outbreak on campus, Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht also noted that all five UC medical centers and all 10 UC campuses participate in a twice-a-week phone call with the UC Office of the President (UCOP) to share information about positive and potential coronavirus cases.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student Health is also in contact with the UCOP medical director, who works with the medical directors at each UC campus to inform them about ongoing cases at universities outside the UC and their efforts to treat and contain them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Javanbakht said Student Health is in the midst of preparing a message for the student body about coronavirus and traveling for spring break, as many students are a couple weeks away from packing their bags and leaving Santa Barbara to go home or on vacation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht said the message will warn students about traveling to countries impacted by coronavirus and the possibility of being quarantined in another country or being isolated when returning to campus, he said. It will also include a reminder to report any possible symptoms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So between now and the end of spring break, as developments come up, if something changes, if there’s a new area of activity that we need to be concerned about, then we send messages again,” Javanbakht added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As coronavirus spreads, so does fear, which Javanbakht stressed as the “biggest threat to our campus.” Social media and rumors can instill fears that aren’t real or rational, and news headlines can trigger “fear mongering” if written poorly, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If all you’re looking at is coronavirus updates, over time, it can give a really distorted view and some people can take on what’s called a catastrophic view — that this is a catastrophe,” he said. “Realistically speaking, right now, the risk to 24,000 students on this campus [is] still relatively low.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Again, things might change but overall, right now, go about your day [and] practice good hand hygiene,” Javanbakht said. “We’re doing everything we can.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
