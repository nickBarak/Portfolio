Surfers hail from a broad variety of places and cultures. I have a lot of good things to say about most of the surfers I’ve met in my travels. Then again, I have a lot of bad things to say about a lot of the surfers I’ve met. And most of the latter group come from Southern California and Santa Barbara. The bros in particular.</p>\n<p>However, there is a rare breed of die-hard surfers I’ve met in Santa Barbara, who get things done under the radar, who don’t surf the beach in hopes of glamour, pussy and a beach bod.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you can spot them lurking in the back of a party around midnight, checking NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) before they allow themselves another drink. Sometimes you can hear them in the mornings around 5 a.m., rubbing sleep out of their eyes and wearily dragging their wetsuits and damp towels down I.V. alleys to their surfmobiles. Sometimes you have no idea they exist because they live as mountain men in Los Padres National Forest, well below your glitzed-out radar.  Probably the most noticeable giveaway of a salty sea-vet’s behind-the-scenes surf activities is when you overhear one noting the wind conditions late at night. Or when you’re at their secret spot and they’re threatening to drown your kook ass— you’ll also know then.</p>\n<p>These are the surfers who don’t immediately saunter up and brag about where they surfed or the waves they got that day — instead they are looking forward, always stretching toward more spots, more waves, better designs, increased stoke. What these elites pull from their sessions is the knowledge of the perfect combination of wind, tide, direction and light required to create the ultimate dawn sesh at T’s, ’Con, Lil’ ’Con and certain other areas up and down the coast.</p>\n<p>These aren’t the shaggy-haired blonde boys and girls sitting in front of you in lecture, sporting bright pink Electric shades, obscene blue trunks, sorority rush shirts and surfer-style trucker hats. Not the fools who stain their reps by going for broke all day. (“Hey bra did you see that epic set at Sands yesterday? I like totally busted a rodeo flip over the whole UCSB surf team.”)</p>\n<p>Instead, these are the people accustomed to the chain of maneuvers that settle you into the precarious overhang beneath a slabby tube. They see swell lumping in from the horizon and know precisely how to start the elevator drop down a watery cliff-face into exalted tubedome.</p>\n<p>Surfers thrive in every nook and urine-drenched alley of Isla Vista. They exist in abundance in the state, nation and most of the coastal world.</p>\n<p>The only problem with surf bro-ciety is that there are too many wannabee Jordys out there, but too few Gerry Lopezs. Everyone wants to throw the biggest air all the time — but guess what? — waves are made of water. Try staying in the water for a while before you get any grandiose ideas, big fella.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot to be said for the type of person who learns things the hard way — through patience, practice and persistence. And passion, I could add.</p>\n<p>As a side note, there is also that unique breed which owns a house in Montecito, dates 19-year-old models from UCSB and moonlights as a world-champion surfer. How does he do it? Is he human?</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus Surf Columnist Elliott Rosenfeld will drown your kook ass if you ever suggest that he’s getting laid again.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26911\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/nuglets-wisdom-bitches-love-surfer-vibe-bra/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26911\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/nuglets-wisdom-bitches-love-surfer-vibe-bra/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/nuglets-wisdom-bitches-love-surfer-vibe-bra/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/nuglets-wisdom-bitches-love-surfer-vibe-bra/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/nuglets-wisdom-bitches-love-surfer-vibe-bra/","id":2288,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[2287,2286,2285],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld","biography":"Not available","articles":[2122,2138,2149,2167,2259,2288,2298,2299,2381,2765,2788,2794,2862,2892,3000,3128,3161,3529,3534],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Queer Commission, board member of the Student Affairs Student Council, director for Coalition for a Better UC and diversity education coordinator for the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel is currently a Letters and Science Senator on the A.S. Senate, was First Senate President Pro-Tempore, a social conduct caseworker for the Office of the Student Advocate and is a coach on UC Santa Barbara’s mock trial team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During opening statements, both Kopel and Dumalo spoke about wanting to unite the campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Throughout my time here, I’ve seen a lot of good, but I’ve also seen a lot of division,” Kopel said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao echoed that statement, explaining that there is an “A.S. bubble” on campus and said he wants to make sure that “all of our voices are heard.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Topics discussed at the forum can be seen below:</span></p>\n<p><b>NUMBER ONE PROBLEM:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said one of the biggest problems facing students on campus are financial problems and identified the $66 fix, an item on the Democratic party platform focused on free higher education, as a way to help with this issue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel agreed with Dumlao. She referenced her position within UCSB’s Lobby Corps and said students need to put pressure on the state legislature to fund the UC.</span></p>\n<p><b>ADVOCACY:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel spoke of her time on the senate, stating Senate has passed several resolutions in support of various communities on campus, specifically the LGBTQ+ and Jewish communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Obviously I am not a part of all of the communities on campus and I can’t empathize with every single community, but as a woman, as a member of the LGBTQ community and also as a Jewish student, I can definitely sympathize with members of marginalized communities and I will always work to be their resource,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said as president, he would make sure that every community is heard at every level, specifically within A.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he has been doing work with marginalized communities “pretty much my whole time at UCSB through protests, plannings, meetings, pretty much everything under the sun.”</span></p>\n<p><b>PRIORITIES:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said his priority as president would be making sure that A.S. listens to the general student body because “A.S. shouldn’t be deciding on what we focus on based on ourselves, we should be talking about the needs of the community members and making sure that they understand that we are here for them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel said A.S. needs to prioritize completing projects that may be lost from year to year and creating a continuing projects coordinator position within A.S.</span></p>\n<p><b>EXPERIENCE:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said he has been involved with “every space on campus” and referenced his time with the RCSGD and Queer Commission among others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel again spoke of her time on senate and about her experiences with marginalized communities on campus. She said her time on campus has allowed her to develop relationships within A.S., the administration and the Office of Student Life that would allow her to succeed as president.</span></p>\n<p><b>NEWCEN:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel said her personal opinion on the University Center project does not matter to students and encouraged students to vote based on their own opinions. Kopel recently announced her opposition to the UCen project through a Facebook statement on Sunday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said “renovating the UCen is really, really important” but said he believed the renovations should not be paid for with student fees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students can vote in the A.S. election on G.O.L.D. from April 23 to April 26.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

multipurpose room to discuss current and future UC Santa Barbara mascots. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About 20 students gathered at the Student Resource Building’s multipurpose room to discuss their issues with UCSB’s current mascot, the gaucho, or an Argentinian cowboy. Students expressed concern that UCSB negatively represents Argentinian people by using caricaturesque features like a mask and grimacing face on “Olé,” the mascot that appears at UCSB sports matches.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ani Vahalia, second-year biology major, said during the town hall that explaining the university’s current mascot to other people is “really awkward” because it appears to be representing a “racial trope.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vahalia said that, considering a significant part of the student population is Hispanic, the problems with Olé and UCSB’s tradition of throwing tortillas at soccer games are “kind of obvious.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Why is that our mascot? Is it any better than… the Redskins?… A lot of our student population are people of color who have dealt with slurs and awkward representation,” Vahalia said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hailey Phelan, a fourth-year global studies major and one of the event’s organizers, said that many people have recommended replacing the gaucho with a raccoon, but said the word “raccoon” itself can contain a slur which could also become problematic in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the </span><a href=\"http://www.ucsbgauchos.com/fan_zone/Locos/nickname\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">university’s athletics website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the university settled on the gaucho as its nickname in 1936 after the female student population voted to change the mascot from the roadrunner because of the 1927 film “The Gaucho.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 1980s, “Gaucho Joe” became an iconic figure in cheering on the team at basketball games, and in the 1990s basketball fans became famous for throwing tortillas on the court during games. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the athletics website, the tortillas “often stopped </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">play and resulted in technical foul calls against the Gauchos.” In 1997, UCSB’s basketball coach was ejected from a game against the University of the Pacific after failing to control the tortilla-throwing crowd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student showed support for the current mascot and said he does not see the gaucho as an offensive figure, but rather a symbol of values from a distinct set of people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cristian Zapata, a third-year biopsychology major, said that as someone of Argentinian heritage, he does not believe the gaucho is “racist.” Zapata said gauchos are a group of people “represent[ing] freedom and virility” and should be seen as a unique subculture — a group of people who chose not to adapt to modern lifestyles and live in the rural countryside.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also said that the name Olé is fitting for UCSB because the commonly-used phrase is a part of the prominent soccer culture in both Argentina and the university. Zapata said that gauchos eat a form of bread similar to the tortilla, making UCSB’s sports tradition very fitting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leanne Friedrich, a graduate student studying materials in the engineering department, said regardless of whether the mascot is verifiably “racist,” students’ interpretation of the mascot as such is “completely distracting.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phelan suggested the possibility of keeping the gaucho as a mascot but rebranding its imagery to be historically accurate by dressing the mascot in appropriate clothing, perhaps portraying them on horseback.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the main difficulties in changing UCSB’s mascot rest on the financial impact a rebranding could have on the university, specifically on its intercollegiate athletics departments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Phelan, the athletics department has said the university’s mascot needs to be intimidating to other sports teams, explaining Olé’s aggressive appearance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Samantha Stopol, a fourth-year economics major, said she believes the gaucho is a folk hero in South America and a proud figure but said she believes Olé should be redesigned because the mask he wears makes him look like a criminal and provides a negative image. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phelan also said many of the university’s online domains such as GauchoSpace would also need to be renamed and relicensed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the athletic and financial repercussions that a mascot change could have, Phelan noted that alumni feel an attachment to the Gaucho name, which should be considered when proposing a change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katya Armistead, Dean of Student ife, also spoke about student’s perception of the mascot and suggested students tie values they respect to the mascot, regardless of whether it is changed in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event’s organizers Phelan, Mario Infante, a fourth-year computer science major, and James Ferraro, a first-year history major, said they held Friday evening’s town hall in order to facilitate the discussion around the current mascot but were not advocating for a specific change.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Ferraro is a first-year history major, not a history of public policy major. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

I know why you did it. I know it’s not your fault. Moss was coming off a season in which he accumulated 13 touchdowns and almost 1,300 yards, all with quarterback Tom Brady still recovering from an ACL tear. It was logical to assume that with a healthy Brady running the offense, Moss would have no problem eclipsing last season’s numbers. Those of you who believed this have been duped.</p>\n<p>So far, Brady’s throwing to anyone but Moss, who has accumulated a total of nine receptions for 139 yards, including a grand total of zero receptions in Monday night’s game against the Miami Dolphins.</p>\n<p>At this point, Moss owners have two options: Bench Moss and hope he turns it around or abandon ship and trade him.</p>\n<p>Trading a high profile player like Moss can be a difficult thing to do, but the longer you wait the less likely you are to get good value for him. I can guarantee you that in your league there is at least one owner in need of a wide receiver, and that same owner may still believe that Moss will turn his season around. If you act now, you may still be able to trade Moss and receive good value for him in return.</p>\n<p>However, most fantasy owners are not stupid. They might call your bluff. To sweeten the deal you might want to add into the mix one of your bench players who could fill a need on their team. The downside of this is that you now are losing two players, but in the end it will be worth it to have a productive player in Moss’s place. This plan can be used to deal with any big name player performing like Moss. Remember, a little trickery every now and then never hurt anyone… except the person being tricked.</p>\n<p>In any case, the second type of headache player is a bit more difficult to deal with. Titan running  back Chris Johnson provides the perfect example. Looking at the record-breaking numbers of Johnson’s 2009 season, his average draft position of 1.4 for this season seems justified. However, despite a couple of good performances, Johnson has been wildly inconsistent, as any fantasy owner unlucky enough to draft him first will tell you. He should not have been drafted one spot ahead of Vikings running back Adrian Peterson, who has been much more consistent this season.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it is unlikely that you will be able to get good value for Johnson in a trade. He is still one of the best players at his position, and he has the talent to turn his season around. But until he does, you should consider benching him for a more consistent performer, because as it is Johnson is just as likely to hurt you as he is to help you.</p>\n<p>Everyone has their draft day regrets. There is no such thing as a perfect draft because there are just too many factors outside the fantasy owner’s control. No one can account for injuries or unexpected slumps.</p>\n<p>What matters is how you deal with the rotten spots on your roster. If you deal with your underachievers soon enough, you may be able to prevent them from doing irreparable harm to your record.</p>\n<p>Make trades, work the waiver wire, watch for favorable matchups and adjust your lineup to make sure you trust your starting players to perform.</p>\n<p>Lastly, make sure no one tricks you into making a bad trade. It’s all fun and games until someone gets Randy Moss.</p>\n<p>Pick Up of the Week: BenJarvus Green-Ellis, RB, New England. Yes, the Patriots are on a bye week, but don’t let that stop you from grabbing Green-Ellis while you still can. So far, he succeeded where Laurence Maroney failed and has somehow convinced Bill Belichick to give him the ball consistently.
