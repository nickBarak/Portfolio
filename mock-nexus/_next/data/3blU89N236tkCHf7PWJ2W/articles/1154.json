He makes us go,” Pasternack said. “It was the first game in 32 games that he wasn’t our point guard…we were fairly injury-free this year. Unfortunately, it happened at the most important moment.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A non-contact injury that came at the worst possible time would be the catalyst in UCSB’s end to a historic year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nonetheless, the Gauchos powered on through the first half and headed into the break with a 28-25 lead over the Titans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the second, Heidegger and McLaughlin took over the scoring duties for UCSB, and the shorthanded win seemed possible as the Gauchos ballooned the lead up to 42-34 following back-to-back threes by Jarriesse Blackmon and McLaughlin which shifted momentum entirely in SB’s favor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackmon’s triple came at the 13:39 mark, and it was his first three-point field goal since Dec. 22, 2016 when UCSB played Nevada. Ironically, when he hit that shot over two years prior, Devearl Ramsey had been playing with Nevada as a freshman and played in that game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gaucho lead reached a pinnacle after Heidegger drilled a fall-away jumper from the inside left-hash to give the ‘Chos a 45-35 advantage, but Fullerton began to make its comeback.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slowly but surely, the Titans continued to clip at the lead, but UCSB held its own until there were six and a half minutes separating the Gauchos and the Big West Finals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If only it were that simple.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara’s 54-47 lead was snipped down in the final six minutes as the Gauchos went absolutely ice cold from the field and couldn’t hold off the Titan comeback. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fullerton rode a 14-4 run to close out the contest and ultimately took the lead with 1:12 left in the game after a Khalil Ahmad layup.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB shot an abysmal 0-10 on its final 10 field goal attempts, but without Devearl Ramsey on the floor, who could blame them?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos ached without their quarterback running the offense and although they made do for a little, there was no production at the end of the semifinal matchup. UCSB was unable to convert on a field goal over the last 7:07 of game-time and Fullerton caught fire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In two seasons as the Gauchos’ head coach, Joe Pasternack has taken this team from what was the worst season in program history in 2016-17 to the best two-season stretch, an overall 45-19 record, that UCSB has ever seen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a great culture,” added Pasternack. “As good of a culture as I’ve ever been around, especially the guys that didn’t play. That’s really hard to find. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, freshman Amadou Sow became the program’s all-time freshman leader in points scored with 391 and field goals made with 150. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sow was named to the All-Big West Second Team, and Ar’mond Davis notched an honorable mention from the Big West for his 13.1 points per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jarriesse Blackmon was awarded Big West Conference Hustle Player of the year in his senior season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will say goodbye to Davis, Blackmon, Ami Lakoju and Maxwell Kupchak from their current roster.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The question looms: Would UCSB have made the finals if Ramsey doesn’t get injured in the first half?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing is for sure. Pasternack, Ramsey and the Gauchos will bounce back with a vengeance after this semifinal heartbreak.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

This same record was achieved by the men’s basketball team just last season, as well as during the 2007-08 season’s campaign.   </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming off a big postseason win, the Gauchos are in inspired form that will hopefully carry them through the remainder of the Big West Tournament. As it was during their last encounter, UCSB versus CSUN once again went down to the wire. This time, however, the Gauchos managed to erase a 12-point deficit, late in the second half, as the team mounted a comeback win of 71-69.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal State Fullerton, meanwhile, will be eyeing postseason glory as well as a .500 win percentage in this upcoming match versus UCSB. The Titans’ overall record on the season now improves to 15-16, while their 10-6 conference record, the same as the Gauchos’, seeds them as the No. 3 team in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal State Fullerton’s quarterfinal matchup against UC Davis proved to be an overtime affair as the Titans earned their hard-fought win by a score of 75-71. This is the Titans’ first win in the month of March, and they will be looking for a second if they hope to keep their season alive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos split their two confrontations versus the Titans during the regular season, with a loss on the road before winning at the Thunderdome in late February. In terms of the history between these two sides, UCSB has the slight advantage in leading the all-time series by a record of 48-40.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In UCSB’s corner, sophomore guard JaQuori McLaughlin and graduate guard Ar’mond Davis will be the ones to watch for this upcoming postseason matchup. Gaucho Head Coach Joe Pasternack started off proceedings a bit differently in the quarterfinals by employing a starting five made up of four guards, instead of the normal three or two, and this paid off immensely. In their last game against CSUN, McLaughlin and Davis combined for 31 points, along with five rebounds apiece. Both players have played a significant role for the Gauchos all season long, and their presence in the postseason is a testament to the depth of UCSB’s star-studded roster.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the Titan end, the usual catalysts of senior guards Khalil Ahmad and Kyle Allman Jr. were once again responsible for their team’s success. Both the top two scorers for their team in terms of total points, Ahmad and Allman Jr. were the only Cal State Fullerton players to finish with double digits in scoring for the quarterfinal bout against UC Davis. It would be in UCSB’s best interests to find a way to halt this dynamic duo’s offensive production.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This installment of the Big West Tournament semifinals is shaping up to be an exciting one,  the second-seed Gauchos take on the third-seed Titans at the Honda Center this Friday, March 15, at 9 p.m. </span></p><div

But for Toronto Raptors’ superstar Kawhi Leonard, the past 10 months have been some of the most agonizing any NBA player has faced in the modern era. Forget 10 months; 10 days is all it took for the beloved San Antonio forward to have a fall from grace previously unseen in not just the NBA but the sports world altogether. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decorated superstar had come into the 2016-17 season as a top candidate to win the MVP race. The face of the franchise, Tim Duncan, had announced his retirement the summer leading up to the season, thrusting Leonard into the forefront of Spurs basketball </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an organization synonymous with class and poise. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The season culminated with a Western Conference matchup against the Golden State Warriors, after dominating the Grizzlies and the Rockets 4-2 each. The fateful Game 1 in Oracle haunts Spurs fans to this very day. With a commanding 23-point lead in the third quarter, Leonard went up for a shot to add to his 26 points </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">only to have Warriors center Zaza Pachulia make a dirty closeout leading to Leonard leaving the game. The 23-point lead the Spurs had built up to this point disintegrated and the Spurs would go on to get swept 4-0, with Leonard unable to play the rest of the series.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, the plan was for Leonard to make his return after the preseason. However, his debut in the 2017-18 season was repeatedly pushed back until Dec. 12. He went on to play nine games that entire season, citing continued pain in his quadricep as preventing his return. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, here’s where everything takes a turn. Leonard was diagnosed with a quadriceps tendinopathy by the Spurs’ medicalstaff. Tendinopathy is essentially a catch-all term for any issue with a tendon from soreness to a tear to a degenerative disease. Leonard had been cleared for play repeatedly throughout the season by the Spurs’ medical team. However, due to lingering pain, he elected to get a second opinion and was then diagnosed with a quadriceps contusion, which is internal bleeding of the muscle susceptible to calcification. Leonards refusal to play despite being cleared by the team’s medical staff in favor of a second outside opinion caused tensions to arise within the organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coaches and players started putting pressure on Leonard through the media, and the basketball world sided with them. At the time, very little to almost no information was known to the public. It is still unknown what the final diagnosis on the injury is to this day. In light of the lack of information, the media and fans sided with the Spurs, which had been a model of how a top-class organization should be run from top to bottom for almost 30 years until this point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leonard was vilified and ridiculed by the basketball world. Prominent media members like Skip Bayless accused Leonard of crumbling under the expectations of filling Tim Duncan’s shoes, while others began to question his character as a person altogether. A very clear divide had formed </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one where it was Leonard versus the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unable to rebuild trust with the Spurs organization and fans, Leonard requested a trade. Leonard had two years under contract left and had expressed explicit interest in going to LA to continue to grow his brand and career. Knowing this, very few teams were willing to part with assets that matched the talents of a player as decorated as Leonard. I mean, a two-time defensive player of the year and Finals MVP doesn’t just come every draft </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they’re once-in-a-generation type players, but only getting such a player for one guaranteed year turned many teams away from making a deal with the Spurs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toronto Raptors General Manager (GM) Masai Ujiri is not your regular GM however and despite knowing all that he knew, he took a wild gamble. The Raptors had lost to LeBron for four straight years, even though they built their team to match up specifically against the Cavaliers. After yet another upsetting elimination at the hands of James, Ujiri pulled the trigger to trade their franchise star DeMar DeRozan and roleplayer Jakob Poeltl for Leonard and Danny Green. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toronto was ridiculed for taking such a gamble </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">giving up a young All-Star in return for a superstar who had played nine games the prior season due to injury and was set on moving to LA in the near future. Nonetheless Ujiri made the controversial move, which has paid off greatly this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Raptors effectively locked down the second seed, not just in the East but the NBA as a whole behind Milwaukee. After making quick work of the Orlando Magic in 5, the Raptors faced the 76ers who were widely thought to have the best starting five after the Wariors. This series went to Game 7, and with the game on the line, Leonard ripped the hearts out of every Philly fan by hitting a series-ending game winner over Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toronto found themselves matched up with the best team in the NBA: the Bucks. After going down 0-2, Toronto rallied behind Leonard  to pull out a win in double overtime. Toronto went on to win four straight after losing the first two games to get to where they are today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leonard has come a long way from his initial fall from grace, and now stands on the verge of carrying the torch of best player in the world in the post-LeBron era to come in a few years. Now, he is less than seven games away from redefining not just his career but the NBA balance of power as a whole with the crucial 2019 free agency looming. But for now, NBA fans are all anticipating the redo of the matchup stolen from us by that injury two years ago.  </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88839\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/nba-finals-preview-kawhi-leonards-journey/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88839\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/nba-finals-preview-kawhi-leonards-journey/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/nba-finals-preview-kawhi-leonards-journey/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/nba-finals-preview-kawhi-leonards-journey/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/nba-finals-preview-kawhi-leonards-journey/","id":1151,"author":{"id":23,"name":"Nithesh Perumal"},"related":[1150,1149,1148],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Houston, We Have a Problem: In Defense of Chris Paul","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2019-06-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cp.jpg?resize=183%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cp.jpg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1","description":"Chris Paul is unfairly being blamed for his deteriorating relationship with James Harden","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cp.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1405860106\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"89075\"><img data-attachment-id=\"89076\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-20/houston-we-have-a-problem-in-defense-of-chris-paul/cp/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cp.jpg?fit=183%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"183,275\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"cp\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cp.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cp.jpg?fit=183%2C275&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-89076 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cp.jpg?resize=183%2C275\" alt=\"\" width=\"183\" height=\"275\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cp.jpg?w=183&amp;ssl=1 183w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cp.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 183px) 100vw, 183px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>Chris Paul is not the player he used to be.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a Chris Paul (CP3) fan, watching the playoffs this year was an oftentimes laborious task. Even with a big man like Kevon Looney switched onto him, Paul struggled to get to the hoop, demonstrating the lack of explosiveness that comes with 14 years in the league and a litany of soft-tissue injuries along the way. Save for his performance in game six against Golden State, Paul truly looked like a shell of his former self in the playoffs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ll also be the first to admit that CP’s contract is an albatross, with the aging guard due nearly 120 million dollars over the next three years. While it was a deal that general manager Daryl Morey had to make at the time, it will also severely limit the Rockets’ financial flexibility in the near future.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, I was shocked to see the reaction from the media when reports came out that Chris Paul had requested a trade from the Rockets after several fights with superstar James Harden. Nearly every report I read blamed Paul for the scuffles, claiming that Paul didn’t know his place on the team and was the reason for the Rockets’ inability to advance to the NBA finals the last two years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be clear: the main disagreements between Paul and Harden stemmed from Paul wanting Harden to be involved off-the-ball and from Paul’s desire to run more set plays instead of isolation sets on offense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the life of me, I can’t understand how Paul is in the wrong in this situation. Clearly, Paul recognizes he has lost a step on the offensive end, and rather than try to play iso-ball, he wants to run the offense like a traditional point guard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even in the worst year of his career, Paul averaged nearly 16 points and more than eight assists per game in the Rockets’ offense. While Paul’s athleticism and finishing may be in decline, he still has elite vision and basketball IQ. If Morey and Harden could get over their egos, there is absolutely no reason Paul can’t thrive at the twilight of his career. Before his back injuries, Steve Nash averaged more than ten assists per game as a 38 year old, and Paul and Nash have comparable playstyles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, there is no question that James Harden is an elite isolation player — undoubtedly the best in the NBA. In the regular season, that will allow you to put up historic numbers, as we saw with Harden’s streak of 32 straight 30-point games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in the postseason, with defenses keying in on you, it becomes much more difficult to just iso your way to a bucket. When Harden didn’t iso in the postseason, the Rockets’ offense had no flow — in large part due to his lack of effort off-the-ball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Harden’s style had been successful in past postseasons, I would argue that Paul should co-opt his style to allow Harden the freedom he needs on offense. But it simply hasn’t garnered results in the postseason. Everyone likes to harp on Paul’s choking in the postseason, but let’s not forget that it was Harden who was benched in the 2015 postseason, and Harden who couldn’t win either game six or game seven after Paul went down last year with an injury against Golden State.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than likely, Chris Paul will not be traded. While he is still a very effective player, he is quite obviously being overpaid with his contract, and few franchises will be eager to overpay for an aging, oft-injured point guard. In other words, Paul and Harden need to figure this out now, especially with the west wide open this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, Houston needs to adapt its system to allow for both Paul and Harden to do what they do best. The reason Carmelo Anthony is no longer signed with an NBA team is because he was unable to recognize that his game needed to change as he got older. In a lot of ways, Paul has already done the hardest part by acknowledging that he isn’t the same player he used to be and that he can’t just take turns running isolation with Harden. Now, the Rockets need to do the same and create a system that maximizes the talents of this version of Paul and Harden. If they can do that, there is no reason this team can’t win the title.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.
