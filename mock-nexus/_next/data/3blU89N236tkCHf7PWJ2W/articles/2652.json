The students, in October 1968, covered the building’s name with a sign reading “Malcolm X Hall” and demanded an increase in black student enrollment and representation.

A.S. F&amp;B fully granted seven requests and tabled seven requests.</p>\n<p>American Indian Student Mentor Association (AISMA) requested $6,000 for their annual harvest festival introduced at last week’s meeting. AISMA agreed to use their one-time exception clause in allocating funds for the event.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to fully fund their request.</p>\n<p>The University Recreation Center (UCen) requested $1,100 for their quarterly UStudy Program, which would allow the UCen to be open for 24 hours beginning Saturday of dead week until Thursday of finals week.</p>\n<p>UCen conference coordinator Samantha Moon said the UCen would also be providing study spaces, tutoring and snacks to students.</p>\n<p>“The UCen will be open for 24 hours, the lower-level conference rooms will be opened as study spaces and will be offering free tea, coffee and snacks after 1 a.m.,” Moon said. “We will also be holding CLAS sessions in Corwin Pavilion and free massages in Flying A Studios.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to table the request for a week to request further information.</p>\n<p>Native American Indigenous Languages (N.A.I.L.) requested $1,100 for their annual Workshop on American Indigenous Languages (W.A.I.L.). The workshop will be a daylong event with speakers presenting research on the various indigenous languages of the Americas.</p>\n<p>N.A.I.L. representative and graduate student Morgan Sleeper said the conference is a platform for undergraduate and graduate students, community members and scholars to present their research.</p>\n<p>“It’s an academic conference on American Indigenous Languages, and for many, this is a safe environment to present at their first academic workshop,” Sleeper said. “There’s also a scholarship program that is funded by the workshop.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to fully fund the event.</p>\n<p>SB Hillel requested $160 for their Open Mic Night on Nov. 5 and their Hummus Cookoff Night on Nov. 10. The Open Mic Night allows students to watch and participate in singing. The Hummus Cookoff Night aims to educate people about the Jewish student population on campus.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to bundle and fully fund the two requests.</p>\n<p>Out in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (oS.T.E.M.) requested $450 to cover the registration fee for attendance at the fifth Annual oS.T.E.M. National Conference, which brings together students and professionals from various S.T.E.M. fields for professional development and networking.</p>\n<p>According to oS.T.E.M. representative and fourth-year chemistry major Sam Alcantar, the conference allows students to learn about resources for LGBTQIA+ professionals in S.T.E.M. fields while developing leadership skills.</p>\n<p>“oS.T.E.M. supports LGBTQIA+ people in S.T.E.M., an underrepresented community in S.T.E.M.,” Alcantar said. “There are big LGBTQIA+ hiring companies at the conference. We’re building as a chapter and we hope new members develop and learn leadership skills.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to fully fund the request.</p>\n<p>Health &amp; Wellness requested $13,500 to purchase a vending machine for sexual reproductive health products. The vending machine would operate 24-hours every day of the week and dispense items such as emergency contraception (Plan B), condoms, lube, tampons, pads and nonprescription pain relievers.</p>\n<p>Health &amp; Wellness representative and third-year biology major Eyra Dordi said the purpose of the machine is to increase access to contraception on weekends and after hours when students do not have access to Student Health.</p>\n<p>“The problem we have on campus right now is that there is a lack of access to Plan B on campus on the weekends. Currently, at Student Health, you can get Plan B for $25 which is much cheaper than other places where Plan B can cost up to $50 or $60,” Dordi said. “The problem is if you have unprotected sex on a Friday, you would not be able to get Plan B from Student Health until Monday, when Plan B would be far less effective.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to table the request for a week to discuss the logistics of the machine and to consider bundling the request with Health &amp; Wellness’s condom dispenser.</p>\n<p>Hermanos Unidos requested $400 for their Annual Thanksgiving potluck that will be held in Santa Catalina Hall’s Linda Vista Room.</p>\n<p>A Hermanos Unidos representative said the event is for everyone at UCSB and provides a dinner for those who are unable to go home for Thanksgiving break.</p>\n<p>“The money is for a Thanksgiving potluck, which this year we are opening up to everyone at UCSB to spread awareness of our organization and give students who can’t go home for Thanksgiving a Thanksgiving Dinner,” the representative said.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to table the request for a week with stipulation that Hermanos Unidos request funding from Santa Catalina’s Hall Council.</p>\n<p>Kappa Alpha Theta requested $1,815 for their annual spaghetti fundraiser dinner. The event will be held on Nov. 15 and is an open-community event to raise money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.</p>\n<p>Kappa Alpha Theta president and fourth-year communications major Kelly Ikeda said the annual event is in honor of a fellow sorority sister who passed away due to leukemia and will support current sisters who have family members battling the diseases.</p>\n<p>“We started this event because a sister of Kappa Alpha Theta at Cal Poly SLO, our neighboring school, passed away from leukemia several years ago,” Ikeda said. “This year we also have three sisters who have family members who were recently diagnosed with leukemia or lymphoma.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B voted to fully fund the event with the stipulation that Kappa Alpha Theta purchase all utensils, napkins and plates from A.S. Recycling.</p>\n<p>Korean Campus Ministry (KCM) requested approximately $500 to send 45 members to a KCM winter retreat.</p>\n<p>KCM representative and fourth-year language, culture and society major Carrie Han said the retreat is for all eight chapters of KCM.</p>\n<p>“This can also be considered a conference,” Han said. “We’re hoping that our members grow not only spiritually but also as leaders.”</p>\n<p>A.S.

id=\"caption-attachment-65465\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microsoft Corporation’s Senior Director of Environmental Sustainability and UCSB alumna Tamara “TJ” DiCaprio discussed her role in reducing Microsoft’s carbon emissions in a talk titled ‘”Carbon Neutrality IS the Bottom Line: The Development and Success of Microsoft’s Innovative Carbon-Fee Model” Wednesday evening at Bren Hall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DiCaprio recounted the process of convincing Microsoft executives to work toward carbon emission reduction through an internal carbon fee model, which the corporation has now used for four years. DiCaprio also discussed Microsoft’s clean energy projects in developing countries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DiCaprio said the carbon fee model imposes fees on business units within Microsoft Corporation according to their carbon emissions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we do, technically speaking, is we cascade the price of carbon down through the different business units and then we collect the funds in the central pot and use all those funds for environmental initiatives to reach carbon neutrality,” DiCaprio said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DiCaprio said the internal carbon fee model is gaining recognition in business communities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was just recently, a couple weeks ago, recognized by the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in an article in the business section, which means it’s getting mainstream,” DiCaprio said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to DiCaprio, it was difficult to gain support from Microsoft executives when first attempting to reduce the corporation’s carbon emissions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nobody would come to my meetings,” DiCaprio said. “When they did come to my meetings, they would come and do emails the whole time. I couldn’t capture anyone’s attention, let alone get engagement in their brains.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DiCaprio said she was able to secure the support of executives when she learned to “speak their language” and focus on the relationship between carbon emissions and money, which lead to the creation of the internal carbon fee model.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started thinking: Okay, I’m in a business, I’ve got to start talking in terms of dollars,” DiCaprio said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to DiCaprio, Microsoft also funds carbon-offset projects in developing countries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are not only reducing carbon in Kenya and emerging nations, but also taking money from developing countries and getting them out to the emerging nations to develop a low carbon economy,” DiCaprio said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DiCaprio said Microsoft’s nonprofit work is “changing peoples’ lives” by helping developing countries industrialize in a sustainable ways.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are able to allow them not only to plant trees, but also go build factories and sell clothes and manufacture clothing with Puma and then recycle money back to be able to build schools and hospitals for healthcare and get fresh water for people,” DiCaprio said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First-year environmental studies major TJ Keeling said DiCaprio’s talk showed her the potential effects of an individual’s work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It brought into prospective the impact you can have on the environment, and more of the benefits that actually show when you do work,” Keeling said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate student Katheryn Collins said the internal carbon fee model is surprisingly simple.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you hear about it, it makes so much logical sense but it’s not something that I’ve seen widely done,” Collins said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Collins, corporations like Microsoft often create nonprofits to separate philanthropy from business.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They do not want their projects on the side to be associated with their company,” Collins said. “I think this is a really interesting model that has captured the minds of the leadership so well.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate student Jessica Perkins said she was surprised by Microsoft’s work in developing countries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To economically make that kind of impact on a community like that seems so far removed from what companies are able to actually accomplish,” Perkins said.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

from 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. at the Multicultural Center (MCC) to contribute to the third annual Dia de los Muertos celebration at the Santa Barbara Bowl on Oct. 30.</p>\n<p>Dia de los Muertos, or “Day of the Dead,” is a Mexican celebration to honor departed loved ones and assist their spiritual journey. The Altares Workshop, organized by graduate student Rosie Bermudez, will give participants the opportunity to create paper flowers, framed photographs and altars for remembrance. The altars, or “altares,” are decorated tributes to the deceased made of photographs, food and other meaningful items. The Santa Barbara Bowl celebration will begin at 4 p.m. and will showcase music from contemporary Latin bands and DJs, theatre and dance performances, art installations and altars made by local organizations, schools and museums.</p>\n<p>Fifth-year environmental studies and Chican@ studies double major Carmen Mares said while Dia de los Muertos is celebrated in parts of Latin America, it is centralized in Central and Southern Mexico.</p>\n<p>“Dia de los Muertos reminds us that death is a natural part of the human life and if a form of passage to the after-life,” Mares said.</p>\n<p>According to Mares, the student-created altars will also be displayed at the Santa Barbara Casa De La Raza and UCSB Educational Opportunity Program’s “Celebracion De la Gente” event.</p>\n<p>“Altares are constructed with candles, photographs, food and items that the deceased person loved in life,” Mares said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year Chican@ studies major Nayeli Maldonado said during Dia de Los Muertos, loved ones visit cemeteries, construct altares and cook traditional dishes for the deceased.</p>\n<p>Maldonado said she began celebrating Dia de los Muertos after volunteering at the event last year.</p>\n<p>“I’ve come to realize how important it is to share it with my community and continue to pay my respects to my family members that have passed away,” Maldonado said. “It is a way to commemorate our ancestors, thank them for the wisdom they shared and keep their memory alive.”</p>\n<p>Maldonado said she was amazed by how much detail is involved in the event.</p>\n<p>“We decorate the venue, make beautiful and intricate altares, have giant calavera ‘skull’ puppets, free face painting, Aztec dancers, mariachi, art installments and much more,” Maldonado said.</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Sabrina Delgado said she has never participated in the Dia de los Muertos event and is excited to be part of the Chican@ experience.</p>\n<p>“Since I have never been to this kind of event, I am really excited to finally be able to be part of something that unifies the community through music and art to honor the dead,” Delgado said.</p>\n<p>Delgado said although her parents are Mexico natives, she did not grow up celebrating Dia de los Muertos and wants to learn more about the holiday’s significance.</p>\n<p>“My family has never celebrated this event as much as other individuals do,” Delgado said. “I am looking forward to this new experience and [to being] more in touch with my culture and [celebrating] this beautiful event with others.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
