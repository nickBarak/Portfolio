id=\"caption-attachment-63465\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Over the past couple days, fourth-year music major Azeem Ward has gone from graduating senior to Facebook and Buzzfeed celebrity as a result of the enormous following his senior flute recital has gathered.</p>\n<p>His Facebook event page, “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/874090079303714/\" target=\"_blank\">Azeem’s Senior Flute Recital</a>,” has over 41,000 people listed as “going,” and that number is continually on the rise. Following this incredible and almost instantaneous explosion in popularity, an article posted by Buzzfeed helped to rocket Azeem to the forefront of, strangely enough, British media.</p>\n<p>Azeem said this whole ordeal started when he made his Facebook event public instead of private.</p>\n<p>“I guess when you make public events, they go viral now or something. If you read the description it just says ‘please come out and support,’” Azeem said. “I invited like 600 friends, but in the beginning, it was just like 70 people going, and at the end of the day, it was 120 people going and this guy from England, the UK — Damon Poole — was one of the first people to repost and then repost again.”</p>\n<p>Azeem said he doesn’t know Poole and has not been able to reach him either. According to Azeem, the event page “took off” following Poole’s repost.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know him and, at that point, random people started commenting ‘Yea Azeem!’ ‘You’re gonna kill it!’ ‘It’s gonna go off,’” Azeem said. “And then I started seeing the memes, you know, like me on the moon with girls and stuff.”</p>\n<p>All this popularity, though, came from out of the blue, Azeem said.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t do anything,” Azeem said. “One night it was 150 [people attending the event], last night 12k and now it’s like 40k … Just out of nowhere.”</p>\n<p>Azeem said, despite the newfound internet fame that he has found, the recital is really about the music for him.</p>\n<p>“I’m just here trying to do my thing, you know, play the flute,” Azeem said. “It’s a standard flute recital, you know? I’m not gonna do anything crazy.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63464\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63464\" data-attachment-id=\"63464\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-15/azeem-ward-overnight-flute-sensation/azeem_lorenzo-basilio-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Azeem_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,401\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1431606146\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"35\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Azeem_Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Azeem_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Azeem_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63464\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Azeem_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=600%2C401\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Azeem_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Azeem_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63464\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>With all the buzz following him, Azeem said he has gotten offers from papers and radio stations all over the UK to talk about the experience, and even received an offer to perform another recital at Bristol, which he said he is dubious about accepting.</p>\n<p>“People from the UK newspapers wanna interview me and stuff, and a guy at Bristol, the event manager there, wants me to come and do a recital,” Azeem said. “I wanna see how people react to it first, ’cause I’m not sure they understand what I’m about to do.”</p>\n<p>As a result of this unpredicted popularity, Azeem said he is concerned that his friends and family won’t even find seats at the recital.</p>\n<p>“I’m gonna have to reserve the front row for my friends, family and roommates, ’cause I gotta have those people there, you know? Those people mean a lot to me,” Azeem said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year CCS music major Robert Johnson, who will be performing with Azeem at the recital, said people are traveling from across the globe to see Azeem’s recital.</p>\n<p>“Someone is actually flying in from Britain,” Johnson said. “My friend is picking him up at the airport in the morning.”</p>\n<p>Johnson also said he is trying to change the location of the concert to a bigger venue to accommodate more people.</p>\n<p>Despite his Facebook popularity, Azeem said he is uncertain as to what his future in the music business will bring.</p>\n<p>“They haven’t even really heard me yet, you know what I mean? If people are still interested in me going over to the UK and actually want me to go and do the recital for whatever reason, then I’ll do that — I’d be down,” Azeem said.</p>\n<p>Azeem said he is currently working on composing music for film in addition to preparing for the suddenly-big recital this Sunday.</p>\n<p>“I’m working on a composition for a silent film by Alex Payne that’s gonna premier at the Reel Loud Film Festival next week,” Azeem said.</p>\n<p>According to Azeem, even though he appreciates the newfound fame, he doesn’t quite understand it.</p>\n<p>“My page is getting more likes than the guy who won the biggest flute competition in the world, and people are like, ‘Why?’” Azeem said.</p>\n<p>Azeem’s recital is set to be held tomorrow, May 16, at 3:00 p.m. in Karl Geiringer Hall.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

id=\"caption-attachment-63463\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Janet Napolitano<em> Photo courtesy of Politico</em></p></div>\n<p>University of California President Janet Napolitano announced Thursday that the UC has reached an agreement with Governor Jerry Brown on state budget revisions to increase funding to the university, potentially freezing in-state tuition at its current rate of $12,192 until the 2017-2018 school year, and funding programs such as a system-wide curriculum review.</p>\n<p>The budget proposal, known as the “May Revise,” establishes a four percent annual base funding increase to UC over the next four fiscal years, totaling $507.3 million by 2019. It also includes $436 million over the next three years to reduce UC’s pension liability. A tuition freeze would be contingent on the UC Board of Regents lowing its pension ceiling and establishing benefit plans for certain employees in accordance with the 2013 Public Employees Pension Reform Act.</p>\n<p>UC plans to further increase revenue by raising the Student Service Fee by five percent annually and, if approved at the May 21 meeting of the UC Board of Regents, increase out-of-state tuition by eight percent annually. The budget will go to the state legislature for consideration.</p>\n<p>Napolitano said Brown has acknowledged the importance of UC education by agreeing to the budget revisions.</p>\n<p>“With this agreement, the Governor has recognized the need to reinvest in UC as well as the imperative to provide students, their families and the University with a reliable way to budget for the cost of a UC education,” Napolitano said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Communications Director for the A.S. Lobby Corps and first-year art history major Lacy Wright said she supports the proposed increase to the Student Services Fee, because UCSB Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) is in need of better funding.</p>\n<p>“C.A.P.S. works so incredibly hard to help all the students seeking counseling, but just doesn’t have the funds,” Wright said. “Students often have to wait weeks to see a counselor, and this wait could be drastically shortened with the increase in funds.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology and black studies major Mohsin Mirza said while Student Service Fee provides important services, students should not have to bear so much of the financial burden.</p>\n<p>“The services fee will go to programs that are very helpful and necessary, like increased funding for mental health services so C.A.P.S. can hire more practitioners,” Mirza said. “It’s incredibly important, but unfortunate that, once again, it’ll be students who, across the state, already are struggling financially, who will have to be picking up the tab rather than the state.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63462\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63462\" data-attachment-id=\"63462\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/budgetproposal-to-freeze-in-state-tuition-provide-more-program-funds/brown_budget-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,399\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1416399737\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Brown_Budget-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63462\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?resize=600%2C399\" alt=\"Daily Nexus File Photo\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown_Budget-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63462\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Daily Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p>Mirza said the proposed increase to out-of-state tuition is “unfortunate” because it will exclude many people of lower economic classes from attending a UC.</p>\n<p>“Out-of-state students are already extremely financially burdened, and I worry that this latest increase will mean that only the wealthiest out-of-state students will continue to afford to be here.”</p>\n<p>According to Mirza, Prop 13 reform and UC budget transparency can help eliminate future “tuition battles.”</p>\n<p>“These are the big changes we need, and the only way I can foresee that happening is if we can build a stronger student movement over the next two years,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Napolitano said the budget revision will not accommodate UC’s desired increase in enrollment.</p>\n<p>“It does not fund California student enrollment growth — so our work is not done,” Napolitano said in a statement.</p>\n<p>According to a statement from the UC Students Association (UCSA), UCSA President Jefferson Kuoch-Seng said while May Revise is an important step, students should continue pushing for lower tuition.</p>\n<p>“Today’s announcement contains promising news for California UC undergraduates,” Kuoch-Seng said. “However, students will continue our direct advocacy in Sacramento and build broad support across California within and beyond our campuses.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said he is “cautiously optimistic” UC will use new state funding efficiently.</p>\n<p>“The UC has a history of mismanaging funds, it was a key reason as to why Prop 30 failed to have the impact we had hoped it would,” Mirza said. “I know students will be doing their best to hold them accountable.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The vigil provided a space to “leave feelings behind.” <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) hosted a candlelight vigil in Storke Plaza Wednesday evening to provide a space for students, staff and residents of Isla Vista to honor lives lost to suicide.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. members placed over fifty white paper bags containing tea lights along the steps leading into Storke Plaza for the vigil, upon which volunteers and attendees wrote words of remembrance. Students and I.V. community members paid their respects at the event and released floating lanterns into the Storke Plaza pond.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. psychology intern Shannon Hackett said she was inspired to host the event by students at UC Irvine who held a similar candlelight vigil to honor victims of suicide. According to Hackett, students need spaces to discuss their losses and to share tragedy preventative measures.</p>\n<p>“I think that this is something that really just meets a need at UCSB,” Hackett said. “We lose students pretty much every year either to accidental death or to suicide and it’s a way to just give people a space to honor people.”</p>\n<p>Hackett also said she hopes the vigil was a place for survivors to “leave feelings behind” and participate in healing interactions.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the times we’re talking more about prevention or intervention and there’s not a lot of time to talk about those that we have lost,” Hackett said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major and C.A.P.S. student health peer Melina Mossberg said the candlelight vigil was meant to welcome a variety of students, not just those who have lost someone to suicide. Mossberg also said she hopes to continue hosting events that will adapt to meet the needs of the UCSB community in the future.</p>\n<p>“This is the first time and we’re trying it out and, hopefully, this will be something that we’ll continue doing in the future,” Mossberg said. “People will always have this space and they’ll have an opportunity to come and even just be allies if they haven’t lost somebody.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think it’s important for survivors, for the people who are here, to be able to honor the person that they’ve lost and also to just raise awareness about suicide, just so they know people care. – C.A.P.S. Director Jeanne Stanford</p></blockquote>\n<p>C.A.P.S. Director Jeanne Stanford said C.A.P.S. hopes to host similar events during Suicide Prevention Month in the fall to continue providing an outlet for people to support each other and share their experiences.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important for survivors, for the people who are here, to be able to honor the person that they’ve lost and also to just raise awareness about suicide, just so they know people care,” Stanford said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and psychology double major Nelson Moreno said the vigil was another step towards the removal of the stigma surrounding mental health issues, and served to bring students together, especially given the May 11 Sabado Tarde incident.</p>\n<p>“It’s been done in other UCs and I think having it here in Santa Barbara will promote an understanding and compassion toward people that have completed suicide,” Moreno said. “I think this month can be very triggering to students especially with the tragedy.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Janice Ong said students need opportunities to discuss sensitive issues such as suicide at events like the candlelight vigil.</p>\n<p>“It helps students understand and gives them a safe space to talk,” Ong said. “I feel like suicide is not talked about a lot; it’s really sensitive and … this gives a safe and healing space for students who have maybe experienced any of that in their life.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of the Thursday, May 14, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63415\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/vigil-honors-lives-lost-to-suicide/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63415\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/vigil-honors-lives-lost-to-suicide/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/vigil-honors-lives-lost-to-suicide/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/vigil-honors-lives-lost-to-suicide/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/vigil-honors-lives-lost-to-suicide/","id":2751,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2750,2749,2748],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
