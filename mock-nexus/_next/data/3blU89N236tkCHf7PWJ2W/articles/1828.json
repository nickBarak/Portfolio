For Morrison, the biggest losses were the </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-22/university-sheriffs-office-discourage-deltopia-celebrations-in-light-of-coronavirus-crisis/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">now-postponed Warm-Up</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and Extravaganza concerts held annually during spring quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the Program Board knew these concerts couldn’t be facilitated during spring quarter, they looked for imaginative solutions, according to Morrison.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At the end of the day, we have to really focus that our base mission is providing entertainment for students, and we can think creatively about how we can do that,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make up for spring quarter shows and events that had been pushed back or cancelled, Morrison said ASPB decided to invite high-profile speakers for Zoom events.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process proved to be hectic, Morrison said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We kind of just got thrown into this and started having to plan events really fast, versus [having] the previous quarter to plan these events,” Morrison said. “We were planning these events as they were happening.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But despite having to move quickly, securing the talent was relatively straightforward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These are all speakers that I would say that we couldn’t probably bring during the normal year,” Morrison said. But the virtual nature of the events sometimes made convincing the guests simpler — the usual costs and hassles associated with traveling, staffing and paying for a venue would not be necessary, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And because </span><a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/biz/features/hollywood-coronavirus-entertainment-industry-unemployment-jobs-1234592106/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">performers in a frozen entertainment industry</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> no longer have the assurance of steady pay, they have become more flexible with their schedules, according to Morrison. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Their whole livelihood was basically doing events, so I think that now they’re honestly looking for these types of gigs.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The transition to Zoom, however, was not not completely smooth. For the first few gatherings, Morrison recounted one instance of Zoombombing and difficulties ensuring that event attendees were not from outside of UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of the small issues aside, I think it’s been great and I think that people have really come together and worked hard to make these events flow,” Morrison said, adding that all ASPB members have begun to moderate events.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morrison pointed to the Binging with Babish event as one instance of success this quarter, where the titular YouTube personality offered viewers a behind-the-scenes tour of his filming locations — a clandestine opportunity that students wouldn’t have received had the show taken place in person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was our first time doing a big virtual event with an outside talent using this new webinar platform,” Morrison said. “And everyone was just so nice and wonderful and wholesome. It was really sweet.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From that first event, the ASPB has hosted events ranging from a talk with comedian Eric Andre to a </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-10/lil-paint-y-with-lil-yachty/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">night of painting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with rapper Lil Yachty, complete with a question-and-answer session.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When UCSB eventually transitions back to on-campus instruction, the ASPB will likely dial back the frequency of high-profile visits, Morrison said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s wanting to use students’ fees in the best way possible,” she said. “It would be harder to bring in the talent that we are bringing — we’re able to do this because of this kind of new situation and because the costs of it are a lot different.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But when UCSB switches back to on-campus learning, Morrison said that the ASPB won’t forget the difficulties they overcame.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One thing I think [the pandemic] taught us: to be really appreciative of this opportunity that we have on board to book events for students,” Morrison said. “I don’t think we realized until it was gone just how much we love doing this.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But how you can deal with setbacks like this, issues like this — if you can figure out a way through it, you can make great things happen,” she added.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chancellor Henry T. Yang announced the transition in an email to the student body on Monday afternoon, writing that the decision was made in consultation with students, staff and faculty and with the agreement of the Academic Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Summer Sessions staff previously told students in a campus-wide email on April 4 that a final decision regarding Summer Session A, which is scheduled to begin on June 22 and end on August 1, would be announced by April 17. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university has not made a decision on how it will conduct Summer Session B, which is scheduled to begin on August 3 and end on September 12, and concurrent sessions F and G, but said in the FAQ that a decision would be made by June 15. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang said in his email that it was likely that the later sessions would also be moved to remote instruction “if the State and County orders promoting physical distancing have not been revised.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the FAQ website, the university noted that specific lab and studio courses do not have remote alternatives, and that “it is critical that students who need these courses be given the opportunity to continue making degree progress in Summer if at all possible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Session B is also when we host our transition programs for incoming freshmen and transfer students, which have a strong community-building component that can best be delivered in person,” the FAQ website reads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Given the volatility of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the many unknowns, we would like to give the situation sufficient time to develop so that if there is any chance of safely hosting Session B in person, we can do so.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the university does switch to remote instruction for Session B, when programs such as the Freshman Summer Start Program and Transfer Edge are typically held, UCSB is “preparing to transition the programs to the virtual space.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are committed to providing a strong academic experience, access to helpful workshops and resources, and social and community-building activities for our incoming students,” the FAQ website reads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Courses for Session A and concurrent sessions C, D and E will be held during their scheduled time slots, according to the FAQ. Currently, the university is moving forward as if all courses in Session B, F and G will be held in-person, but is preparing to switch to remote instruction if necessary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some summer courses are traditionally held online each summer, but with the transition to fully remote instruction, courses designed to be taught in-person will now have to be adjusted to online as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the FAQ, the university emphasized differences between online classes and remote instruction, describing online courses as ones that “have been specifically vetted, approved, and optimized for online learning,” while remote instruction is being used to describe classes that “were designed for in-person instruction, and are being adapted for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the transition to remote instruction for Session A, the university will not be offering campus housing to new students in June and July, according to the FAQ, but students currently living in campus housing will be allowed to stay during the summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FAQ also pointed students toward residences in Isla Vista, where hundreds of students are currently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-ucsb-students-grapple-with-i-v-leases-after-university-strongly-recommends-moving-home/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">subleasing their rooms</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after moving home for the quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Session B, Housing &amp; Residential Services is planning on offering its usual services, but is waiting on a final decision.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who sign up for summer housing will be able to cancel their contracts with no penalty if the university switches to remote instruction for Session B, according to the FAQ. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will still be virtually putting on its three pre-college programs, the Research Mentorship Program, the Summer Research Academies and the Summer Scholars Program, for high school students. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

For spring quarter, the team upgraded GauchoSpace’s capacity for connections to help the site function with heavy traffic, according to Gus Wood, instructional applications operational expert for GauchoSpace Development and Support.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“GauchoSpace wasn’t designed and set up for quite this environment right out the box, so we’ve kind of been looking at analytics of use and then applying changes to the system configuration as we go,” Wood said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a user has an issue with GauchoSpace, they can either submit a </span><a href=\"https://help.lsit.ucsb.edu/hc/en-us/requests/new\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ticket</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the support team explaining the issue or attend the Monday to Friday, 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. drop-in College of Letters and Science IT hours over Zoom. The team works remotely now, but Wood considered the transition “fairly seamless.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, Wood’s team spends “more time than usual” helping instructors — who’ve never used GauchoSpace in any significant capacity — navigate the platform and tailor their classes to an online curriculum. Wood added that his team needed to help many instructors set up and use the testing options on GauchoSpace. Not all instructors use GauchoSpace to conduct exams, but there have been disputes between university members and proctoring services, such as </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-16/ucsb-faculty-association-issues-letter-advising-against-the-use-of-proctoru-testing-services/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ProctorU</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, about privacy concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Testing administered through GauchoSpace is by far the biggest use of data on the platform, especially due to remote learning, according to Diane Soini, GauchoSpace’s learning management system programmer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you have 800 people and the quiz closes all at once for all of them, all of a sudden, several systems have to calculate everybody’s grade and submit all of their submissions,” Soini said. “It’s a pretty big hit to the system.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GauchoSpace Development and Support team can monitor exams with tight deadlines in real time in order to respond quickly to issues that could occur during the testing period, according to Soini.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wood manages seven graduate student instructional design assistants who help the website perform various tasks, with the bulk of their work spent helping professors and teaching assistants successfully utilize the platform. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With midterms in full swing, the challenge of adapting tests and quizzes to an online platform  while maintaining the tests’ rigor and difficulty level has kept the design assistants busy answering questions and concerns from instructors. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can provide advice on what question types to use, and depending on how instructors would prefer to grade their midterms, what settings to use and we address a lot of concerns about cheating,” Erica Johnson, an instructional design assistant, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although cheating remains an issue for some professors, Johnson said the opportunity to cheat is unlikely to disappear.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t say that there’s a way to completely prevent cheating and sharing of answers, but there are some measures that we can take in the online tools that we use to minimize that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson added that essay-style questions, randomizing the order of questions and answers and time limits are all effective tools for preventing cheating over GauchoSpace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another instructional design assistant, Jonathan Downey, added that the graduate students were generally working more hours now, with most of the graduate students working on average 20 hours a week </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">double the hours of last quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of grad students will be TAs and whatnot, this is kind of what I do in lieu of that,” Downey said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GauchoSpace, which was built on an open-source platform called Moodle, allows the support team to share tips with other universities about how they’ve learned to adapt GauchoSpace using Moodle under the new circumstances. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Utilising Moodle’s open-source software, programmers across different universities can share how they’ve solved bugs and shortened the time a support team needs to troubleshoot, according to Hector Gonzalez, GauchoSpace’s instructional applications programmer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While UCSB announced Tuesday that all </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/all-summer-sessions-to-be-conducted-remotely-university-announces/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">summer sessions </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">would be carried out through remote instruction, the fate of in-person classes for fall quarter remains uncertain. Until the university makes its decision, the GauchoSpace team will need to keep up its increased support level.  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re definitely going to need to maintain that elevated level of support,” Wood said. “I would say that’s what we’re anticipating.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94319\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/gauchospace-sees-increased-visits-new-challenges-amid-remote-instruction-transition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94319\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/gauchospace-sees-increased-visits-new-challenges-amid-remote-instruction-transition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/gauchospace-sees-increased-visits-new-challenges-amid-remote-instruction-transition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/gauchospace-sees-increased-visits-new-challenges-amid-remote-instruction-transition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/gauchospace-sees-increased-visits-new-challenges-amid-remote-instruction-transition/","id":1826,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[1825,1824,1823],"comments":[{"id":"ed41853a-c670-4b77-b404-4d428a2eb3a9","name":"Sample User 4","email":"mocknexus@gmail.com","parent":null,"content":"Proin diam magna, aliquam at justo in, pharetra blandit orci.

The workshops were also recorded so professors could access them later on the </span><a href=\"https://keepteaching.id.ucsb.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instructional Continuity site.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Adler-Kassner, UCSB’s history of teaching through natural disasters and crises turned out to be helpful in responding to the coronavirus pandemic.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had a pretty good infrastructure to support this partly because of the Thomas Fire,” Adler-Kassner said. “We already had the Instructional Continuity site set up, and because we know Summer Sessions A and B and all the sessions in between will be offered remotely, we’re developing more resources.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Instructional Support Team also holds regular online “coffee hours” over Zoom for instructors and teaching assistants to talk about their remote instruction experiences. If a staff member needs assistance outside of these meetings, the support team is readily available for consultation, Adler-Kassner said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we think toward fall and wait for the campus to provide some guidance about what’s going to happen, we’ll of course be there to support that in very proactive ways,” Adler-Kassner added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from teaching support, the UCSB Academic &amp; Staff Assistance Program (ASAP) is  providing mental and emotional health support for faculty. The group, which offers short-term counseling, consultations, workshops and more, is assisting professors in identifying and managing work-related and personal concerns; these resources are available on </span><a href=\"https://www.hr.ucsb.edu/asap\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the ASAP website.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ASAP also organized the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 Pandemic Coping Skills Resource Group, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which holds group meetings for staff to connect with each other, discuss and learn coping skills and maintain their psychological well-being under stressful circumstances, as described in an email sent out to faculty by the Pati Montojo, the ASAP manager and a licensed psychologist. The group has also started a </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGmApjVWytiKQksNDjoZw8g/featured\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YouTube channel</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, uploading videos that help viewers understand anxieties related to the pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall, who supervises academic planning and programming at UCSB, described the shift to remote learning as a “miraculous transformation,” praising the faculty and staff for their dedication to making the online environment possible in just a few weeks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If somebody had asked us a year ago and said, ‘We want you to transform your whole curriculum to remote teaching, and we’re going to give you a year to do it,’ people would’ve said, ‘Are you crazy?’” Marshall said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Marshall, while instruction for Fall Quarter 2020 remains uncertain, the university hopes to welcome students back to campus for future quarters. However, campus life will likely </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-10/hybrid-course-schedules-single-dorms-face-masks-for-all-preparing-for-fall-quarter-2020-at-ucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not resume to norma</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">l by fall, and UCSB is prepared to continue remote instruction if that is the case.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Until there’s a vaccine, we’re going to be living in somewhat altered circumstances,” Marshall explained. He described a mixed approach to instruction involving a combination between online and in-person classes to reduce density and encourage social distancing. “Whatever arrangement we can make to have it be safe and effective,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, many </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-24/pandemic-pedagogy-faculty-prepares-for-first-quarter-of-remote-instruction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">professors would rather teach face-to-face</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> classes, but as more resources develop, their classes are slowly becoming accustomed to online formats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a lot of innovative teachers. They’ve also gotten help from their students who I think, in many cases, are more conversant, more comfortable, with technology,” Marshall said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adler-Kassner added that as both professors and students adapt to the situation, they’re helping each other create an efficient space for both sides of the screen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s helpful for students when they know we faculty are doing the best that we can and trying to sort of think about things,” Adler-Kassner said. “It’s also helpful for faculty to really hear about the student experience.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are things that we are learning from this experience that can improve our teaching overall.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94450\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-16/a-spectrum-of-support-how-ucsb-is-helping-instructors-teach-through-a-pandemic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94450\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-16/a-spectrum-of-support-how-ucsb-is-helping-instructors-teach-through-a-pandemic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-16/a-spectrum-of-support-how-ucsb-is-helping-instructors-teach-through-a-pandemic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-16/a-spectrum-of-support-how-ucsb-is-helping-instructors-teach-through-a-pandemic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-16/a-spectrum-of-support-how-ucsb-is-helping-instructors-teach-through-a-pandemic/","id":1827,"author":{"id":279,"name":"Melea Maglalang"},"related":[1826,1825,1824],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
