Going on its first road trip of the season, the Gauchos will also travel to Cal State Northridge for another crucial conference game on Sunday.</p>\n<p>UCSB enter tonight’s game with an overall record of 7-5-1 overall and 1-1 in the Big West, splitting the result at home last weekend. Hawaii comes in at 5-6 overall but is still in search of its first conference win of the season as it dropped its first pair of games in league.</p>\n<p>Defense has carried the Gauchos the entire season. Against UC Irvine last Friday, Santa Barbara shutout the Anteaters for a 1-0 win, making all of the Gauchos’ victories come by way of clean sheets. Besides solid play from its veteran defenders on the backline, UCSB has been helped tremendously by the big play of sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Ritter leads the Big West conference in goals against average with 0.68, and shutouts with six. When UCSB went on a five-game winning streak earlier in the season, her clean sheets in all those games were the most consecutive shutouts by a UCSB goalkeeper since 1989.</p>\n<p>“We’re not terribly surprised, but the fact that she stepped in with little or no experience has been huge,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “Just to have her step in and have her do as well as she did just from the word ‘go’ has been great.”</p>\n<p>Prior to the team’s last loss on Sunday versus Long Beach State, junior midfielder Madison Beckley had been red hot playing up top for UCSB. Beckley notched the only goal in Friday’s win against Irvine, bringing her goal total to five, the most on the team. Aside from her goals, Beckley has been creating scoring chances for the Gauchos by recording two assists, tied second on the team.</p>\n<p>Hawaii will rely on its home crowd for tonight’s matchup. Last season, the Rainbow Wahine were not able to win a conference game on the road, yet only lost one league game when playing in Hawaii. A key point of emphasis for Santa Barbara will be the passing game. Turnovers by way of errant passes derailed the Gauchos offensive opportunities in its last lost.</p>\n<p>“[The game plan] doesn’t really change terribly. We want to do what we do well,” Stumpf said. “Some of the goals we have is we want to possess the ball 65 percent of the game or more, we want to create more chances for ourselves.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will have to be on lookout for junior forward Tiana Fujimoto who has scored six goals on the season, second in the league, and is the Warrior’s main threat on offense.</p>\n<p>Once the Gauchos finish playing the Warriors, they will head back to California for a matchup against Cal State Northridge (5-7-1 overall, 0-1-1 conference). Despite the long distance traveled in few days, the players are set on playing at the same level of intensity.</p>\n<p>“We have that Friday, Saturday gap so I don’t think we’ll be that concerned with Sunday’s game,” sophomore forward Angelisa Cortez said. “It’s about mentality, so you got to go out there and think [you’re] going to win.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore goalkeeper Cynthia Tafoya will guard the back of the net for the Matadors and will present trouble for UCSB offensively; her 44 saves on the season are fifth in the league.</p>\n<p>Kickoff for tonight’s match against Hawaii is scheduled for 10 p.m. and Sunday’s game at Cal State Northridge will begin at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of October 10th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Gauchos dropped back-to-back matches in overtime against New Mexico and Stanford before shutting out LMU, ensuring they enter conference play in a winning fashion with a 5-4 overall record.</p>\n<p>Fullerton, meanwhile, enters Friday’s game as the Big West team with the most losses this season with a 3-5 record. The Titans, however, have won their previous two games, outscoring their opponents by a margin of 6-2.</p>\n<p>“I think they have good attacking players, and you know, Big West Conference means that you can kind of throw out preseason; it just starts again,” Vom Steeg said. “We have to build on what we’ve done the last week and a half. For us, and for everybody, it all starts on Friday. And whether it’s Northridge or Fullerton, we have to play well to win games.”</p>\n<p>Likely to lead the Gauchos’ offensive attack this weekend will be a pair of seniors from France, in midfielder Goffin Boyoko and forward Achille Campion. Boyoko ranks first on the team and fifth in the conference with four goals scored this season, while Campion recorded three goals. Assisting the two will be freshman forward Ismaila Jome, who leads UCSB in assists with four, a mark tied for third in the conference.</p>\n<p>While goals have been hard to come by for the Gauchos in nonconference, UCSB cannot afford to play at the same level in the Big West, which features No. 6 Northridge and No. 25 Irvine.</p>\n<p>“We have some players who are going to have to step up for us on Friday if we’re going to have a successful run at the conference,” Vom Steeg said. “In general, I think we need every player to play well. I think the league is good enough, and I don’t think anyone is that talented where a team can have two or three players take a night off and still win the game.”</p>\n<p>After the Gauchos face Fullerton on Friday, they must immediately prep for UC Riverside on Sunday night, a squad that has given Santa Barbara fits in the past.</p>\n<p>“Each time we’ve played them, it seems like we have something missing. They’re a team that has been tough to play against because of the style of play,” Vom Steeg said. “They’re a team in the 4-5-1; they defend, they breakout and for some reason we just have not been able to stamp the game and put them away. Every year that we’ve kept them around, they’ve come back to hurt us.”</p>\n<p>Riverside enters Big West play with a 5-2-2 record, yet has lost its last two games by a combined 5-0 margin. The Highlanders will play at Cal Poly Friday night in their Big West opener before traveling to Santa Barbara for Sunday’s match.</p>\n<p>“I’m excited by the fact that we’re playing Riverside at our place,” Vom Steeg said. “I think Riverside is probably the toughest place to play in the conference. So the fact that we only play them once and we play that game at UCSB is very good.”</p>\n<p>In order for the Gauchos to accomplish their goal of winning the Big West North, they will undoubtedly have to open conference play with a victory, especially considering there are only 10 conference games, with each team splitting the games between home and away.</p>\n<p>“The good news is that if you do reach that goal, it means you’re going to have a real good chance to reach the postseason. It’s going to be very, very competitive,” Vom Steeg said. “Whichever team is the most consistent, whichever team is able to come away with some tough wins or at least get a tough win on the road is going to be the team that comes out on top.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff for Friday night’s game against Fullerton is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. at Harder Stadium, while Sunday against Riverside is set for a 5 p.m. start time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of Oct. 3r’d print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Daily Nexus File Photo</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52316\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/now-is-when-it-counts/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52316\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/now-is-when-it-counts/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/now-is-when-it-counts/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/now-is-when-it-counts/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/now-is-when-it-counts/","id":1603,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1602,1601,1600],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Split Weekend Road Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_05.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_05.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB sits in fourth place in the Big West standings.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>For its first road trip of the conference season, the UCSB women’s soccer team split its two games on the weekend, losing to the University of Hawaii on Thursday but bouncing back on Sunday for a 1-0 win against Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>With the split over the weekend, UCSB is now 8-6-1 overall and 2-2 in the Big West. The two conference wins are the same number of conference victories the Gauchos had all of last year. After Hawaii’s win on Thursday night, the Warriors improve to .500 at 6-6 on the season and are 1-2 in conference. Meanwhile, the Matador’s conference struggles continue as they remain winless at 0-3-1 and 5-9-1 overall.</p>\n<p>UCSB was quick to bounce back early against the Matadors after Thursday’s disappointing loss against the Warriors. In the 14th minute of play the Gauchos got on the board when sophomore midfielder Angelisa Cortez drew the goalkeeper out of the goal, after cutting past the defense. Cortez slid the ball to senior forward Allie Ariniello who had an open goal and put UCSB up 1-0.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It was Ariniello’s fourth goal of the season, second-most on the team, and Cortez’s first assist on the year.</p>\n<p>The game remained even from there on going into the half. Possession of the ball switched between teams in the last 45 minutes of play; each team struggled to maintain control of the ball as the defense from both teams demonstrated solid play in the backline. UCSB benefitted from the early score and played defense against Northridge in the final minutes of the game.</p>\n<p>With less than five minutes left in the game, CSUN had one last shot on goal, but sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter blocked the ball for her second save of the game, giving UCSB the victory. The 1-0 result is the fourth occasion UCSB has won by that score and more notably, all of UCSB’s wins this year have come by way of shutout.</p>\n<p>UCSB travelled to Hawaii for its first road game of the conference season on Thursday; previously the Gauchos had been a respectable 2-3-1 away from Harder Stadium going into the match. Both teams were even in the first half and went tied 0-0 going into halftime, having the same number of shots in the first period with four each.</p>\n<p>Consistency has been a problem for the Gauchos in the second half of games with the team often wearing down towards the end of matches. Against the Warriors, UCSB again had a difficult time trying to maintain its same level of play. Hawaii outshot the Gauchos 9-4 in the second half and pressured Santa Barbara for the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>With 10 minutes remaining, the UCSB defense let Hawaii’s main offensive threat let loose. Junior forward Tiana Fujimoto, who entered the game second in the Big West with six goals, ran past the defense and unleashed a shot from the left side of the field that deflected off the post, and into the back of the net. UCSB had one final attempt on a corner kick in the final minutes of the game but was called for offsides, giving the 1-0 win to Hawaii.</p>\n<p>UCSB now has only four games remaining in its regular season schedule. With two weekends of play left, the Gauchos will have to earn results in the games left in order to remain in contention for a spot in the Big West tournament.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will stay at home to face UC Riverside on Friday and then hit the road once again to face Cal State Fullerton on Sunday evening.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em></em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 14, 2013’s print edition of <em>The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>Photo by Magali Gauthier of <em>The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52458\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-14/gauchos-split-weekend-road-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52458\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-14/gauchos-split-weekend-road-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-14/gauchos-split-weekend-road-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-14/gauchos-split-weekend-road-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-14/gauchos-split-weekend-road-matches/","id":1604,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1603,1602,1601],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Making a Difference on and Off the Field","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A women's soccer feature on freshman Kailey Hackett.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Playing in the Mecca of college soccer under the Friday night lights every week is what all collegiate soccer players dream of although few actually get to experience it.</p>\n<p>However, some of these soccer players can get lost in the shuffle off the pitch once the referee blows the final whistle.

It’s basically a day for them to come to our school,” Hackett said. “We play with them, basically make their day and are with them.”</p>\n<p>The program, which celebrated its fifth anniversary last year, is free of cost and held at Santa Margarita Catholic High School in Rancho Santa Margarita, CA — the very school that Hackett attended. Designed for children ages five and up with special needs, the program allows for each of the kids to get the opportunity to develop their skills and self-esteem through soccer.</p>\n<p>Besides participating in soccer activities, the children spend plenty of time interacting with the volunteers in various other events organized, such as face painting, balloon art and giveaways.</p>\n<p>The matter hits close to home for Hackett, who was inspired to volunteer after hearing the story of one of her best friend’s cousins being diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. That account encouraged Hackett to participate in TOPSoccer, a decision that has left just as big of a mark on her as it does on the children she helps. Although the program runs for only one day, it still leaves Hackett with a profound sense of self every year.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, it feels really awesome because you’re doing something for someone else and having that feeling — there are no words to describe it really,” Hackett said. “I’m very thankful for everything and my health and being a part of making them happy.”</p>\n<p>Despite her endeavors outside of the soccer field, Hackett is quick to remind the crowd of how good of a player she is when she does step onto the grass.</p>\n<p>In the first games of the season, Hackett has complemented the defense of the Gauchos and earned herself considerable playing time for a freshman. In nine games played so far, she has started four of them and proven to be a valuable asset to an already strong defense that features four seniors in the backline. In fact, Hackett was a part of four of UCSB’s shutout wins when it went on a five-game winning streak earlier in the year.</p>\n<p>“We brought her in to play center back,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “We kind of expect Kailey, once [the starters] graduate, to really kind of step in and be that starter that’s going to play an awful lot of minutes at the center back spot.”</p>\n<p>Accustomed to the big stage in high school where she led her team to a CIF championship, the college game brings with it some challenges and a learning curve Hackett still has to adjust to. Just like any other freshman playing for a different team, her first instances wearing the UCSB uniform brought an array of emotions to her, considering how far she has come and what she has given in the past.</p>\n<p>“It was nerve-racking and exciting at the same time because I worked really hard to get this far,” Hackett said. “It feels rewarding because I worked really hard to get to where I am right now.”</p>\n<p>When she is not tackling the ball away from defenders, Hackett is busy tackling the books. Her soccer aspirations fall in line with her academics and just like any student athlete, she still juggles time between the gym and the classroom.</p>\n<p>“It’s pretty stressful because of how much homework we have but I think it’s really awesome at the same time because you’re involved with so much stuff,” said Hackett.</p>\n<p>When the season ends, Hackett plans on returning to her hometown of Coto de Caza where she will join TOPSoccer once again for the winter at her high school. Despite all the shots she has taken while playing, it was the shot Hackett took off the pitch that has stayed with her the most, and which she encourages everyone to take.</p>\n<p>“No matter what, I think people should just go out there and give it a shot and put those kids and those people before you,” Hackett said.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next match is scheduled for Thursday at 10 p.m. against the University of Hawaii.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 9th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52401\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/making-a-difference-on-and-off-the-field/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52401\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/making-a-difference-on-and-off-the-field/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/making-a-difference-on-and-off-the-field/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/making-a-difference-on-and-off-the-field/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/making-a-difference-on-and-off-the-field/","id":1602,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1601,1600,1599],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
