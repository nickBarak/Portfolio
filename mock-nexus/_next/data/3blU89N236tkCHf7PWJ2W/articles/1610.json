With 20 points earned in league, the Mustangs clinch a spot in the Big West Conference Tournament.</p>\n<p>Both sides played an even first half, trading shots on each side of the goal, but neither was able to generate any real chances on frame. With solid play from the defenses and excellent goalkeeping, the match was a 0-0 draw at the half.</p>\n<p>Coming out with the same tenacity and aggression in the second half, the Gauchos were able to hold down the top-ranked offense in the league until the 73rd minute, when freshman forward Elise Krieghoff was able to create space at the top of the box and take advantage of a backline that was playing with one woman down. Playing without three key offensive players due to injury, the Gauchos entered with a huge disadvantage, but received consistent play from their back-up strikers throughout the match. Nevertheless, they were unable to draw even against the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>“They worked so hard and they just have not been rewarded for their efforts this year,” Stumpf said. “I wish we could keep going because we are so close with this.”</p>\n<p>UCSB says goodbye to three seniors, but will retain a large portion of this year’s squad as they look to be serious contenders for next year’s Big West title.</p>\n<p>“We gained so much experience with our young players; we were in every game and the girls did a good job of always competing and always working hard,” Stumpf said. “I definitely like the future of this program.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48456\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-ends-season-loss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48456\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-ends-season-loss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-ends-season-loss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-ends-season-loss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-ends-season-loss/","id":1610,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1609,1608,1607],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay","biography":"Not available","articles":[150,152,153,155,289,402,411,416,419,420,423,433,434,437,439,440,441,442,444,450,456,457,458,461,465,474,476,478,479,481,484,485,489,494,496,502,503,508,512,524,541,600,684,687,701,908,934,936,937,939,940,953,955,959,961,962,963,964,966,1065,1562,1572,1579,1586,1588,1589,1595,1596,1597,1598,1600,1602,1604,1605,1609,1610,1621,1624,1629,1630,1631,1633,1635,1637,1639,1641,1657,1660,1663,1807,2022,2030,2032,2035,2059,3192,3207,3220,3243,3255,4152,4414,4416,4419,4420,4430,4431,4432,4433,4434,4437,4438,4450,4451,4452,4454,4689,4690,4691,4692,4693,4694,4696,4711,4712,4713,4714,4715,4716,4717,5299,5300,5301,5303,5307,5316,5324,5325,5326,5327,5328,5329,5330,5331,5332,5333,5334,5335,5336,5337,5344,5348,5351,5352,5353,5355,5356,5357,5358,5359,5360,5361,5362,5364],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Fighting to Stay Undefeated","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.4.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-23.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.4.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-23.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB takes on Cal State Northridge on the road","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Rare are the opportunities when a team has a chance to make a statement with one victory and establish itself as the team to beat in its conference.

They’re ranked Top 10,” freshman forward Ismaila Jome said. “To get a win against them would put us in a great position to get a playoff birth for the NCAA tournament. We’re just looking forward; it’s a great way to start the conference so heading into it our confidence will be boosted.”</p>\n<p>Both the Matadors and Gauchos enter the match with three consecutive shutout victories, with Northridge holding the top goal scoring team in the conference and UCSB maintaining the top defensive team with only nine goals allowed all season. Something has to give come tomorrow night.</p>\n<p>Freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely, fresh off a Big West Defensive Player of the Week award, has posted three straight shutouts for UCSB and can only hope he and the rest of the backline can reign in the dangerous offensive attack of the Matadors.</p>\n<p>“During the season, we play games that we lose 1-0 and we do the best we can. So the coaching staff told us the only way we’re going to win a game is to have a shutout and that is reflected in our games right now.” Baiden said. “That’s the goal for us now, getting a shutout.

However, soccer always stood out to Josh as his favorite and the one he was best at.</p>\n<p>By age 10, McNeely made the part-time transition to goalkeeper, a move that became permanent at the age of 12.</p>\n<p>“I started playing goalkeeper when I was around 10, which is kind of late,” McNeely said. “My coach put me in there because I was one of the biggest guys on the team. Just making big saves in big games attracted me to the position.”</p>\n<p>Although his move to goalkeeper may have been purely random based on his size, McNeely immediately showed he had a knack for the position.</p>\n<p>His U-16 squad won the U.S. Soccer Academy National Championship, a personal highlight of McNeely’s youth career. Perhaps his most influential moments in youth soccer however came from his training with the Los Angeles Galaxy Academy. While there, he learned from Ian Feuer, current goalkeeper coach for the Galaxy and former MLS and English Premier League goalie.</p>\n<p>“He definitely was a mentor and a great coach growing up,” McNeely said. “He taught me most of what I know about goalkeeping and the position, everything from technique to the mental part of the game. He’s definitely a big reason why I’m still playing today at this level.”</p>\n<p>Growing up in Calabasas, a mere hour from Santa Barbara, McNeely had familiarity with both Santa Barbara and UCSB Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg. Josh’s parents were family friends with Vom Steeg’s sister-in-law, a coincidence that put McNeely on UCSB’s radar since he was 12.</p>\n<p>“When Josh was a young player, I would hear stories from my sister-in-law that her friend’s son was a really good soccer player. The funny part is that you hear that story quite a bit,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>McNeely committed to attend UCSB his junior year of high school, attributing the weather, location, atmosphere and large and successful soccer program for bringing him an hour north of his childhood.</p>\n<p>As coincidence would have it again, McNeely came to Santa Barbara with a fellow impact freshman in midfielder Drew Murphy, with whom Josh had played against growing up since the age of nine until they played on the same Galaxy team at 14.</p>\n<p>“The Galaxy both called us in when we were 14. And it’s funny going from rivals to being good friends on the same team,” Murphy said. “Josh, when we were little, I would like to say he was a knucklehead because of the rivalry.”</p>\n<p>Now in Santa Barbara, McNeely has risen to the challenge of starting as a true freshman, allowing only eight goals in 11 starts, four of which were shutouts. UCSB has won eight of Josh’s 11 starts and seems to have finally found its groove with its first year goalkeeper.</p>\n<p>“He’s been able to avoid mistakes and that’s kind of the real key right now. Every game that goes by, I think he gains some real confidence,” Vom Steeg said. “He has the respect of the players in front of him, he has the respect of the team.”</p>\n<p>With a senior-led backline, the Gauchos defense has been the anchor of the team the entire season, a statement made that much more accurate with McNeely’s emergence. During the first week of conference play, McNeely garnered Big West Defensive Player of the Week honors, and helped lead UCSB to four straight victories to open conference play.</p>\n<p>Already in his first two months in college, McNeely has shown he has all the tools necessary to help UCSB achieve its goal of winning the Big West crown.</p>\n<p>“The good thing about Josh is he’s very humble, he takes a workmanlike approach. I think he has the right mentality and temperament,” Vom Steeg said. “He’s a calm player; he doesn’t play nervous even if he is nervous. Those are all characteristics that can take you far.”</p>\n<p>While McNeely wants to improve as a player during college, his ultimate dream is to play professionally, either overseas or in the U.S.</p>\n<p>“Without a doubt [he’ll play professionally], I don’t even think that’s a question at this point. He has all the tools he needs and it’s just up to him whether or not he wants to,” Murphy said. “As a goalie, it takes a lot more time than a field player. The pro game will without a doubt be in his future at some point.”</p>\n<p>The way McNeely has handled the pressure as not only the starting goalkeeper for UCSB but as a freshman transitioning to college, makes his future in Santa Barbara and beyond looks promising.</p>\n<p>With McNeely between the posts this season and hopefully for the next three after, the Gauchos possess one of the most promising defensive players in the entire country.</p>\n<p>“He has the skill set to play at the next level. He has the right temperament to play goalkeeper at the next level,” Vom Steeg said. “The question is going to be what he puts into it.”</p>\n<p>UCSB continues play Saturday when they face UC Davis on the road for a 3 p.m. kickoff.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of October 16, 2013’s print edition of <em>The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>Photo Courtesy of UCSB Athletics.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52488\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/opponents-fear-the-freshman/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52488\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/opponents-fear-the-freshman/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/opponents-fear-the-freshman/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/opponents-fear-the-freshman/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/opponents-fear-the-freshman/","id":1608,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1607,1606,1605],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Sees Top Keepers in Pair of Games this Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_10.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_10.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Preview UCSB women's soccer vs. UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After splitting its road games last week, the UCSB women’s soccer team will stay at home to play UC Riverside this Friday before traveling to Cal State Fullerton on Sunday, in what is the team’s second-to-last week of conference play remaining.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara comes into the weekend’s matches with an overall record of 8-6-1 and 2-2 in the Big West conference.

Silas has allowed only three goals in the last four games and has emerged as an elite goalkeeper in the Big West.</p>\n<p>After playing UC Riverside, Santa Barbara travels south to Fullerton for another conference challenge. Fullerton’s goalkeeper, senior Lindsey Maricic ranks first in save percentage and total saves so far this season, being a deciding factor in the two games the Titans have earned results in.</p>\n<p>Aside from Maricic on the defensive side of the ball, UCSB will also have to take into account senior midfielder/forward Erica Mazeau. Mazeau has played both her positions well this season, leading the team in goals with three and assists with four.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s defense has been the team’s backbone, however, the team has become a threat offensively. Junior midfielder Madison Beckley leads the team with five goals, ranking third in the league and sophomore forward Angelisa Cortez has notched three goals of her own for the team.</p>\n<p>Kick-off for Friday’s game against UC Riverside is scheduled for 7 p.m. and Sunday’s match versus Cal State Fullerton will begin at 6 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 17th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52512\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-sees-top-keepers-in-pair-of-games-this-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52512\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-sees-top-keepers-in-pair-of-games-this-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-sees-top-keepers-in-pair-of-games-this-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-sees-top-keepers-in-pair-of-games-this-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-sees-top-keepers-in-pair-of-games-this-weekend/","id":1609,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1608,1607,1606],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
