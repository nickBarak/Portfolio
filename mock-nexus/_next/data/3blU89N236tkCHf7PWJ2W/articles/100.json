The Bulldogs are 10-5 overall despite having their five-game winning streak snapped against Harvard on Sunday in a 4-2 loss.</p>\n<p>Still, Fresno has managed to win eight out of its last ten matches. Also, against nationally ranked opponents the Bulldogs are 4-4, having recorded victories over No. 28 UCLA, No. 31 Arkansas, No. 58 Washington State, and then No. 56 Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Fresno is a place that current UCSB Head Coach Simon Thibodeau used to call home for nine years when he was the Head Coach for the Bulldogs’ women’s tennis team.</p>\n<p>During his time at Fresno he helped accumulate 159 wins and produced a plethora of nationally recognized players including ITA national doubles team of the year in Renata Kucerkova &amp; Anastasia Petukhova. However, this game is just like any other, as the red and black attire he once donned are merely fond memories.</p>\n<p>“All new girls, the assistant, the coach, all new people, but when you see the uniform, the logo, the colors, and ‘go dogs go’ it brings back good memories,’ but it’s just another team,” Thibodeau said. “They are doing a good job, they have a strong number one; it will be a good match. It would be nice to win against a former team but it’s not a rivalry or anything.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps it may not be a rivalry in the traditional sense, but there is nothing like getting a win against a former team. The Gauchos have yet to get a win against the Bulldogs during Coach Thibodeau’s tenure, losing the last two times these two teams met. In last season’s meeting between the programs, the Bulldogs were defeated.</p>\n<p>“We are a different team from last year; we have two players that played at the one and two last year and they are at the five and six this year.” Thibodeau said. “It will be nice to win, at one point. We have been close against everyone, just a matter of getting that extra point. We gotta make sure to finish these close matches.”</p>\n<p>The Fresno State-UCSB dual promises to be a good one with plenty of talent. Most notably, the matchup between the nationally ranked duos of UCSB’s No. 19 sophomore Palina Dubavets and junior Stefani Stojic vs. Fresno’s No. 20 sophomore Mayar Sherif Ahmed and her sister senior Rana Sherif Ahmed will be most intriguing.</p>\n<p>The Ahmed sisters enter with a 14-6 overall record in doubles, winning seven out of their last ten and are 3-3 against nationally ranked pairs. In the singles department, Mayar is No. 34 at 15-9, 5-6 against top ranked opponents. She has earned two consecutive conference player of the week awards along the way. Rana, the senior bulldog, is 10-10 overall with a 4-5 dual record, all at the four slot.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s match against the Bulldogs will take place today at 11 a.m. at the Rec Cen Courts. Its contest versus Boise State is set for this Thursday, March 24 at 10 a.m. PST at the same location.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69057\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/gauchos-looking-to-surpass-even-mark-face-fresno-today-and-boise-st-thursday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69057\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/gauchos-looking-to-surpass-even-mark-face-fresno-today-and-boise-st-thursday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/gauchos-looking-to-surpass-even-mark-face-fresno-today-and-boise-st-thursday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/gauchos-looking-to-surpass-even-mark-face-fresno-today-and-boise-st-thursday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/gauchos-looking-to-surpass-even-mark-face-fresno-today-and-boise-st-thursday/","id":100,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[99,98,97],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas","biography":"Not available","articles":[82,83,84,89,97,99,100,102,104,112,117,118,119,1014,1048,1051,1052,1074,1085,1087,1090,1105,1108,1109,3300],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Suffers Second Home Loss of the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-20-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-20-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos have lost yet another close match this season after Harvard defeated them 4-3, dropping UCSB to 6-6 overall.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p class=\"p1\">The UCSB women’s tennis team went head to head against the Harvard Crimson on Saturday and suffered its second home loss since February’s matchup against Washington State leaving them with a record of 6-6.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68678\" style=\"width: 145px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68678\" data-attachment-id=\"68678\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-29/68691/lou-adler-hitts-a-backhand-stephen-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-20-web.jpg?fit=800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lou Adler hitts a backhand.

This week was especially tough for Santa Barbara especially because they had to prepare not only for the Crimson, but also against the dreaded end of quarter exams that could have contributed to the team’s performance.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p class=\"p1\">“I have to give credit to Harvard they fought at each possession and they are a tough team they beat fresno state, and we didn’t underestimate them,” Said Head Coach Simon Thibodeau. “Practice was altered due to final exams it was tough to switch gears from finals and back at it. But no excuse. Need more consistency and hang out the court a little longer to make sure we do everything we can.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Crimson undoubtedly have just as a demanding academic responsibility but on the other hand Harvard<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>have now won five straight and have been on the winning end of eight of its last ten matches making up for the slow start to the campaign.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They are 3-2 on the road and will be at home to commence Harvard’s<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Ivy League Conference contests against Cornell and Columbia.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">UCSB started Saturday’s matchup strong as it swept in the doubles portion to seal the point. The first to finish was the Gaucho duo consisting of sophomores Lou Adler and Amanda Atanasson as they defeated senior Amy He and sophomore Nikki Kallenberg 6-3.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Adler and Atanasson are 10-6 overall, 6-3 in dual matches, and proving to be an efficient pair but have played mostly at the three spot winning all six matches while losing three times at the two spot.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The next match ended in the same score as the first as junior Melissa Baker and freshman Stephanie Yamada beat freshman Erica Oosterhout and junior June Lee who are 4-8 as a pair. Baker and Yamada on the other hand are 3-2 winning two straight and demonstrating consistency at the second slot.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The last doubles match to finish was between the 18th best pair in the country against sophomore Annika RIngblom and freshman Sabrina Xiong that were 5-1 together prior to the start of the matchup.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sophomore Palina Dubavets and junior Stefani Stojic handed them their second dual loss of the season by beating the Crimson pair 6-4. Stojic and Dubavets are 17-3 overall and 7-1 in dual play, all at the the one for UCSB.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After securing the first point, Santa Barbara managed to increase its lead by two when sophomore Dubavets beat sophomore Kallenberg in the singles portion of the contest in two sets winning both 6-2. However, UCSB would go on to lose the next four in singles to lose the match.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The other half of the powerful Gaucho duo faced off against the sophomore she had just gotten off the court against in doubles. Ringblom and Stojic went all three sets. The first set finished in favor for SB finishing 4-6.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">However, after winning the first Stojic lost the next two by the scores of 6-4 and 6-3 in a close contest. This match was Stojic’s first coming off an injury where she took three weeks off.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It bugs her a little bit more during practice, but she (Stojic) was up 6-4 and it might have been rust seeing as she hasn’t played in three weeks.” Said Coach Thibodeau. “This is not just on stefani but all the matches that could have gone the other way. I believe she will step it up in the future and she is motivated to do so, and I look forward to seeing her do it”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Another key matchup was between a highly anticipated encounter between senior Amy He and sophomore Natalie Da Silveira. Both came in with positive singles records and multiple consecutive wins. He and Da Silveira have played consistently at the six and that is where they met on Saturday.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After a tough and back and forth game He was able to steal the first set winning 7-6. The second set on the other hand, it seems as if He was able to figure out the young Brazilian and continued to get the ball past her six more times as she won 6-1 to give the Crimson its first point of the dual.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After which Harvard went on to carry the momentum from that big win to win the next three as the tide began to turn against the Gauchos after these crucial points went the other way.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“We are usually strong at the bottom positions. The second set with Natalie i thought she would come back but then was down 4-0.” Said the Santa Barbara Head Coach. “But we have to move forward we have to finish our matches.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sophomore Lou Adler defeated junior June Lee in three sets, 6-7,6-3, and 6-1 to grant UCSB its third and final dual point. The match finished 4-3 in favor for the Crimson.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">UCSB will have to shake off another close loss and prepare for a quick turnaround as it takes on No. 24 Fresno State on Monday, March 21 at 11 a.m at the Rec Center Courts.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69067\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/ucsb-suffers-second-home-loss-of-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69067\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/ucsb-suffers-second-home-loss-of-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/ucsb-suffers-second-home-loss-of-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/ucsb-suffers-second-home-loss-of-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/ucsb-suffers-second-home-loss-of-the-season/","id":99,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[98,97,96],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Continue Winning Ways Against Harvard","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-16-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-16-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB has won five straight home matches and looks to extend that streak against Harvard on Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s tennis team prepares for a tough Harvard team in a match that promises to be an even contest because of the level of competition that both sides have faced up to this point in the season.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68511\" style=\"width: 237px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68511\" data-attachment-id=\"68511\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/ucsb-to-visit-honolulu-will-face-hawaii-oregon/palina-dubavets-hits-a-backhand-stephen-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.01.22_StephenManga_WTennis-16-web.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Palina Dubavets hits a backhand.

I just want to play our best and approach the same.” Said Head Coach Simon Thibodeau.  “We look forward to the upcoming match.”</p>\n<p>Even though UCSB is mixing it up with ten different pairings at doubles, certain players have been consistent throughout, including No. 19 in doubles junior Stefani Stojic and sophomore Palina Dubavets that are 13-3 together and have won nine out of their last ten. Along with them, recent standout sophomore Natalie Da Silveira.</p>\n<p>The sophomore from Brazil has won four straight and in singles is 7-2 but with a nearly flawless dual record of 6-1. As a sophomore she has proven to be dependable at the five and six slots.</p>\n<p>“Not a big surprise to see her do well at the six she could even be our five or four.” Said the Coach. “One thing i’m most happy with is that she is just getting better and better even after she came back from being inactive for about 6 months. She is solid, feisty attitude that wants to roll the opponent off the court pretty quickly.”</p>\n<p>On the opposite side, Harvard has not been able to find consistency in doubles as it has tried over 15 combinations and pairings but has yet to find a stable group. Fortunately, in singles they have found some relief.</p>\n<p>Crimson senior Amy He has won nine of her last 10 singles matches and holds an overall record of 16-4 in singles. However, the senior has only played at the five and six slots so she will have to look out for a tough matchup against the young Brasileira.</p>\n<p>Fellow teammate, sophomore Nikki Kallenberg, has had a strong season so far in singles as well with 14-8 overall all in the first, second, and third slots. The sophomore leads her team in wins but has recently struggled winning only three of her last nine.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara, having recently fallen out of the national rankings due to narrow defeats against top teams in the country, will have to take the opportunities left in front of them in order to climb back into the top 50.</p>\n<p>“We missed our chance for the top 25 but it’s still possible to get back up there if we win the big west and win a round in the NCAA,” Coach Thibodeau stated. “ We can reach the top 35 before the big west and we will see from there. Still confident we can, we just got to pull these big matches and just focus one game at a time.”</p>\n<p>With only a few games left before finishing the rest of its Big West Conference matches, the Gauchos will have to come with a consistent lineup to meet the goals that were set in January.</p>\n<p>UCSB is set to play Harvard at home at the Rec Center Courts Saturday, March 19th at noon.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print
