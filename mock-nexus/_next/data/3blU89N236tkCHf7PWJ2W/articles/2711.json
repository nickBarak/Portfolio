Additionally, Padilla will be able to create tools that make it easier for researchers to organize information that is already available to them, such as email correspondence and documents in inaccessible formats.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">New Mac computers also made their debut in the Learning Commons earlier this summer, which are now the only Mac computers available on campus for general student use.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The installation of the six iMacs and three MacPros comes as part of the technology plan that came with the expansion of Davidson Library.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“We feel that the Mac operating system is the best fit to accommodate for increasingly interdisciplinary coursework,” Rebecca Metzger, the library outreach coordinator, said. “It’s not unusual for a biology student to need a film editing program for a final class project, for instance.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Metzger, funding for the computers came from the library’s budget, mostly made up of state money and private donations. The library also plans to use $30,000 to $40,000 from the Class of 2016 senior class gift to install additional technology.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">One of the biggest plans for the upcoming school year is to address the compact space issue inside the library. Over 250,000 people visit the library every month, and this is expected to increase with one of the largest incoming freshman classes in history starting UCSB in fall 2016.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">This year, library staff will focus on adding furniture and expanding late-night study to other parts of the building. The second floor Mountainside will become available Fall Quarter for late-night hours.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Metzger said she is currently working with UCSB’s Health &amp; Wellness Center to obtain two egg chairs for the library that will help promote relaxation during the demanding academic year.</p>\n<p>According to Metzger, improving the learning commons is an evolving process, and the library staff is always looking for student suggestions regarding technology needs and furniture needs. Suggestions can be submitted at the wooden boxes on the services desks or by emailing <i>outreach@library.ucsb.edu</i>.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, September

2015-2016 school year to facilitate conversations with anyone interested.</p>\n<p>Calvaletto began regularly talking with students, faculty and campus visitors last fall, standing at the booth from either 9 a.m. or noon until 3 p.m. He aims to connect with the younger generation through conversation and is willing to chat with anyone about any topic or question.</p>\n<p>Calvaletto said although the advice and conversations are free, he accepts donations to support mission trips.</p>\n<p>“It’s not about the money so I always have a sign that it’s free,” Calvaletto said. “My children were missionaries in Africa, they’ve now returned to the States, but I plan to use it to help some other types of missions somewhere else.”</p>\n<p>Calvaletto said his main goal is to “make a difference” and encourage the younger generation to make smart decisions.</p>\n<p>“I see culture changing faster than I ever imagined,” Calvaletto said. “So my goal is to one by one encourage students to do what they feel is right.”</p>\n<p>According to Calvaletto, the most important advice he has to offer was given to him by an upperclassman when he attended California Maritime Academy.</p>\n<p>“After a week I wanted to quit,” Calvaletto said. “And an upperclassmen came alongside me and said, ‘You can quit if you want, but you’re not getting back any of your money.’ What I suggest is just stay for this semester and if at the end of this semester if you decide to quit you can quit then.”</p>\n<p>Office of Student Life Dean of Student Life &amp; Activities Katya Armistead said she approved his booth to be on campus and has received nothing but positive comments about Calvaletto.<br>\n“He’s a colorful fellow; I see students really enjoy talking with him,” Armistead said.</p>\n<p>According to Calvaletto, his questions and conversations usually revolve around relationships.</p>\n<p>“What does that tell you about mankind? We were designed for relationships,” Calvaletto said. “People are hurting because of broken relationships — I can only tell them it takes time to heal some of these things.”</p>\n<p>Calvaletto said although he identifies as a conservative Catholic, he is not here to argue his beliefs, despite rumours on social media sites like Reddit.</p>\n<p>“I’m open and honest talking about a relationship with God,” Calvaletto said. “I’m not here to argue; I’m here to be a light and I do believe God loves all these students but it’s not about a religion, it’s about a relationship.”</p>\n<p>Armistead said she was fine with him conversing with students so long as he does not provide academic counseling.</p>\n<p>“My biggest concern wasn’t in terms of what his opinion was; it was that he wasn’t trying to provide anything that was university business,” Armistead said.<br>\nThird-year economics major Christopher Wong said Calvaletto has a lot to offer students on campus.</p>\n<p>“He’s cool, just doing his thing, posting at the corner with his 5 cents sign, probably the most productive 5 cents you can give somebody,” Wong said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Oct. 1 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

While around five students from his floor were stopped, the resident assistant speculates there must be at least 15 rooms involved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a majority of the yelling taking place as late as midnight, the perpetrators have drawn the ire of many students with early classes or jobs, prompting screaming matches between those yelling “cacaw” and those trying to get sleep. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students in the dorms have yelled back pleas for quietude, various profanities and some resorted to threatening violence against the bird callers. Some students remain unbothered.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carmiya Baskin, a first-year residing in San Miguel, said, “there are always people on the lawn talking,” and the bird calls have not really disturbed her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tiffany Wu, an RA in San Miguel, sent a text message to residents stating there had been “a lot of noise complaints lately. A lot of it is coming from outside the building … the RAs are currently working on investigating this issue.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While she doesn’t know the total amount of noise complaints, she has received over 10 noise complaints from her floors alone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residence hall staff has identified and spoken to several students from San Nicolas, though no student was individually documented. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the bird calls have decreased in volume and frequency, they are still taking place. The RAs hope to put a stop to it by reminding students about quiet hours and keeping an eye out for more trouble.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.
