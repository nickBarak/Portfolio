The event was followed by a fashion show highlighting culturally honored representations of self.</p>\n<p>Sociology professor and panel moderator Kum-Kum Bhavnani said culture does not reside within a person or group, but is defined by relationships.</p>\n<p>“The culture is created through our relationships with people … it isn’t a commodity that sits inside of us,” Bhavnani said. “Once you accept that, then you have to say, ‘Well what do we do about culture?’”</p>\n<p>Chican@ studies professor Micaela Diaz-Sanchez said intersectionality should propel this conversation.</p>\n<p>“When we are talking about the appropriation of race with regard to fashion, we should also always be thinking about gender and sexuality and class,” Diaz-Sanchez said. “Who is wearing what, in what context, and by whom is what we are wearing made?”</p>\n<p>English professor Felice Blake said Martin Luther King Jr. envisioned a colorblind world where people could exist in harmony and their “racial differences, appearances, etc. would not be a basis for discrimination.”</p>\n<p>According to Blake, Martin Luther King Jr.’s idea of colorblindness differs from the modern versions widely adopted today.</p>\n<p>“So more often than not, the argument for color blindness usually used to say, ‘Things are fair, everyone take the test and the scores will tell us who is the smart ones, who is deserving, who is worthy — and forget about the past,’” Blake said. “‘It is the people who keep bringing up race that causes the race problem. Aren’t we all supposed to be color blind?’”</p>\n<p>Blake said an important aspect of privilege is ensuring that someone does not feel they have encouraged a system of dominance.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to keep in mind the ways that someone can have privilege without feeling as if they have taken personally a part in producing a system of dominance,” Blake said.</p>\n<p>According to Blake, people oftentimes associate privilege with unearned advantage.</p>\n<p>“Advantages that one has, unearned, simply by virtue of the fact of how one was born — but those advantages come because someone else is receiving some unearned disadvantages at the same time,” Blake said.</p>\n<p>Blake said the reality of inequality is that one does not have to commit a heinous brutality against someone of color to participate in a system that is racist.</p>\n<p>“If you didn’t know before you got here: Sorry, the United States is a racist country,” Blake said.</p>\n<p>Blake said while not every use of appropriation is a violent and cruel practice, one must be open to see when cultural appropriation can be offensive.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t to say that every single instance is an appropriation and is menacing and is a racist practice,” Blake said. “When is it a question of borrowing and exchange, and when is it a question of theft?”</p>\n<p>After the discussion, the fashion show began, featuring outfits from Afghanistan, Nigeria, Columbia, Palestine, Mexico, West Africa, Vietnam and Kazakhstan.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68552\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68552\" data-attachment-id=\"68552\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/faculty-panel-discusses-cultural-appropriation/cultural-appropriation-panel-_by-effie-sklavenitis-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Cultural Appropriation Panel _by Effie Sklavenitis-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-68552\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Effie Sklavenitis / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68552\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Effie Sklavenitis / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>MCC Programmer Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said she was grateful individuals could use this event to showcase their individual cultures and heritage.</p>\n<p>“We are so grateful for our incredible models … who are representing their own cultures, heritages, ethnicities and identities,” Mohsenian-Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Amanda Becerra and participant in the fashion show said she was proud of her Columbian culture but finds it hard to find other students at UCSB who share the same culture.</p>\n<p>“I grew up with Columbian culture.

UCSB Girl Up, an organization that aims to provide a better future and more opportunities for women and girls worldwide, will accept donations during the event going towards aiding girls in Malawi, Liberia, Guatemala, Ethiopia and India.</p>\n<p>Effie Sklavenitis, third-year global studies major and External Vice President of Girl Up UCSB, said the event is an opportunity to support women’s education.</p>\n<p>“Girl Up is shedding light on the need to support girls’ education and inform others about the challenges girls still face today, not only abroad, but in our own country as well,” Sklavenitis said.</p>\n<p>According to Sklavenitis, Girl Up donations go to disadvantaged young girls in other countries who experience inequality and sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“According to the Girl Up website, the second most common cause of death for girls between the ages of 15 to 19 is complications from pregnancy and childbirth,” Sklavenitis said. “50 percent of all sexual assaults worldwide are against girls 15 or younger, and one in seven girls in developing countries is married before the age of 15.”</p>\n<p>Emily Farrell, third-year anthropology major and Social Media Chair for Girl Up UCSB, said the organization raised money to provide bikes for girls in Malawi two years ago.</p>\n<p>“In a month they had raised more than $100,000 to provide bikes, bike parts and maintenance training to 550 adolescent girls,” Farrell said.</p>\n<p>Farrell said the organization is hopeful there will be a good turnout for the screening.</p>\n<p>“Two weeks ago, we hosted a screening of ‘Girl Rising,’ which had a good turnout, but we expect ‘He Named Me Malala’ to be even bigger and better,” Farrell said. “People love Malala and this film is a fantastic documentary, an inspiring account of what she has achieved so far at only 18 years old.”</p>\n<p>Diana Torres Luevanos, fourth-year biological anthropology and history of art and architecture double major and President of UCSB Girl Up, said all girls should have the same rights to education.</p>\n<p>“We are being helped to get an education,” Luevanos said. “Why should girls in developing countries not have the same rights? Why are their dreams worth less than ours?”</p>\n<p>Torres Luevanos said the screening is a great opportunity for the students to understand how fortunate they are to be able to contribute to the advancement of young women and girls who don’t enjoy the same privileges.</p>\n<p>“By showing this movie, we want to show that just as Malala is getting her education, every girl, no matter where they are, they deserve the same rights as we do, they deserve their dreams to be supported and those dreams can be chased with a pen, paper and a school,” Luevanos said.</p>\n<p>Shreya Shailendra, third-year psychology major and Outreach Chair of Girl Up UCSB, said it is “every human being’s right” to receive an education.</p>\n<p>“Hence, it is important to recognize the people who, like Malala Yousafzai, fight for these girls’ rights despite having terrifying amounts of opposition,” Shailendra said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68543\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/girl-up-to-host-screening-of-he-named-me-malala/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68543\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/girl-up-to-host-screening-of-he-named-me-malala/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/girl-up-to-host-screening-of-he-named-me-malala/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/girl-up-to-host-screening-of-he-named-me-malala/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/girl-up-to-host-screening-of-he-named-me-malala/","id":2539,"author":{"id":128,"name":"Siboney Arias"},"related":[2538,2537,2536],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UC Police Blotter: June 30, 2004","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2004-06-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Monday, June 21, 1:29 a.m.: Resident Coordinators who were checking students in for the summer program at the Santa Ynez Apartments refused to allow a female student to enter because she arrived well ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Late Arrival</p>\n<p>Monday, June 21, 1:29 a.m.: Resident Coordinators who were checking students in for the summer program at the Santa Ynez Apartments refused to allow a female student to enter because she arrived well past the 8 p.m. check-in time deadline. Police said shortly after turning the woman away, the apartment complex office received approximately 10 verbally abusive phone calls from who was believed to be the woman’s boyfriend.</p>\n<p>At approximately 2 a.m. a window at the office was broken. The Resident Coordinator thought the woman and her boyfriend were responsible for the damage and called the police.</p>\n<p>The next morning, UCPD officers questioned both suspects who then admitted to the abusive phone calls but denied breaking the window.

Officers said they could not charge the suspect with urinating in public because they did not witness the act.</p>\n<p>Tag ‘N Snag</p>\n<p>Friday, June 25, 3 p.m.: Officers received reports of five suspects spraying graffiti on a hand ball court next to the UCSB lacrosse field in broad daylight. When police arrived, the suspects fled on foot and four of the suspects were captured and arrested.</p>\n<p>Police later determined the suspects stole the spray paint from a nearby storage shed. The suspects were mostly minors from the Goleta area. All four were charged with conspiracy to commit burglary, burglary, vandalism and resisting arrest.</p>\n<p>Cop Beater</p>\n<p>Saturday, June 26, 1:53 a.m.: A disturbance was reported on the corner of El Greco Road and Embarcadero del Norte where a man was allegedly throwing bottles. The man fled the scene when the UCPD arrived and several officers gave chase. One officer was injured while apprehending the suspect, but police did not release the extent of his injuries.</p>\n<p>The suspect was arrested for assaulting a police officer and fleeing from the police. Police said both charges are misdemeanors, but are punishable by up to one year in jail and may include additional fines.</p>\n<p>Cycle of Mayhem</p>\n<p>Saturday, June 26, 2:53 a.m.: Officers observed a male UCSB student riding a bicycle toward them near Picasso Road.
