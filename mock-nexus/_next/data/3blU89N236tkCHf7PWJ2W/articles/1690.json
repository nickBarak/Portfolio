The Gauchos found the back of the net twice on 15 attempts during regulation and senior midfielder Luis Silva needed only 30 seconds in overtime to put away the third.</p>\n<p>Silva is currently leading the Big West in goals with seven, followed closely by fellow Gaucho sophomore forward David Opoku, who has five. Silva also leads the team with 15 points and has one assist on `the season.</p>\n<p>“With the help of the seniors like Silva and [senior defender Tim] Pontius we are looking pretty good right now,” Opoku said. “[Akron’s] passing and movement up top was excellent. We learned some stuff from them and we can take all that and put it into the season.”</p>\n<p>UCSB earned its second overtime win on Wednesday. UC Davis is no stranger to extra minutes. The Aggies recently played a stretch of four consecutive overtime games that ended in two wins and two ties.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully the momentum and the energy we had on the field will translate into our next game,” Vom Steeg said. “We need to play that high level against Davis.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff is set for 3 p.m. on Saturday at Aggie Field in Davis.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41687\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/gauchos-row-aggies/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41687\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/gauchos-row-aggies/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/gauchos-row-aggies/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/gauchos-row-aggies/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-07/gauchos-row-aggies/","id":1690,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1689,1688,1687],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella","biography":"Not available","articles":[716,743,762,820,848,852,1078,1644,1646,1647,1648,1649,1651,1654,1662,1665,1667,1671,1672,1673,1677,1678,1679,1683,1684,1686,1688,1690,1693,1694,1695,1696,1700,1719,1757,1761,1764,1767,1768,2160,2844,4375,4473,4491,4502,4510,4511,4512,4513,4514,4515,4516,4517,4519,4520,4527,4528,4530,4532,4536,4537,4538,4542,4543,4547,4557,4559,4561,4562,4564,4565,4566,5533],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Perseveres, Beats No. 3 Akron in OT","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Being on the wrong side of a 20-game undefeated streak was not something the UCSB men’s soccer team wanted to leave the field with last night.

Coming out of halftime, the Gauchos were forced to return from a place they had only experienced against conference foes this season: being down during the first half.</p>\n<p>“Going down to Akron in the first half, you give them all the confidence they need,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “And to turn it around and come out and play that kind of second half was great.”</p>\n<p>Silva’s game-tying goal in the second half was the beginning of a five-minute sequence that would set an energetic pace for the rest of the game. A cross by sophomore forward Dom Sarle gave Silva the opportunity to score in the midst of Akron defenders.</p>\n<p>“We got the ball in dangerous situations, especially in the second half,” Vom Steeg said. “Not only did [Silva] get the two goals but he was absolutely great in the middle of the field.”</p>\n<p>A goal by Sarle just two minutes later gave the Gauchos their first lead in a game since a victory over Sacramento State on Sept. 25. Senior midfielder James Kiffe’s shot to the low left side was rebounded and placed past the Akron goalkeeper with just over 25 minutes remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>Only two minutes elapsed before the score was tied again, this time by Akron junior forward Thomas Schmitt. A centered pass from the left side of the box was corralled and fired in just yards in front of the box.</p>\n<p>UCSB maintained possession of the ball throughout the first minute of overtime, which was enough for Silva to score a goal and secure the 3-2 victory.</p>\n<p>“[The ball] popped out to Kiffe and I saw him run straight into the box,” Silva said. “I saw him cutting and the ball got to my feet and I just tapped it in.”</p>\n<p>It was Silva’s seventh goal of the year, placing him atop the Big West in goals for the season.</p>\n<p>After scoring just three goals in the three games prior to the match against Akron, and taking over 40 shots during that stretch, the trio of goals last night was welcome reassurance for the Gaucho offense.</p>\n<p>“It’s a relief getting three goals against the defending national champions,” Kiffe said. “It shows a lot of character for our team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to Big West conference play this weekend when it travels to Davis for a game against the Aggies on Saturday at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41624\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-06/ucsb-perseveres-beats-3-akron-ot/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41624\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-06/ucsb-perseveres-beats-3-akron-ot/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-06/ucsb-perseveres-beats-3-akron-ot/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-06/ucsb-perseveres-beats-3-akron-ot/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-06/ucsb-perseveres-beats-3-akron-ot/","id":1688,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1687,1686,1685],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Green Advice for Green People: The Fantasy Tight End Boom","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Before I get into what I really want to talk about today, I’d like to take just a little bit of time to point out what a strange football season we’ve had so far.

In the last three weeks, there have been three unbelievable comeback victories, two of which involved the Buffalo Bills. Last week, Tom Brady threw four interceptions against those Bills, after having thrown four all of last season. Vince Wilfork has two interceptions, the first two of his nine year career. Joe Flacco didn’t complete a single pass in the second or third quarter of Sunday’s game, and yet his Ravens still destroyed the Jets 34-17. And finally, as the Colts continue to suck, the Raiders, 49ers, Bills and Lions all surprisingly look like legitimate contenders.</p>\n<p>And that’s just the NFL. At the college level, the Michigan Wolverines, who have been terrible in recent years, are 5-0 and just ran up a 58-0 win against Minnesota. I’m not sure what’s going on in football right now, but I like it. It’s tremendous fun.</p>\n<p>Anyway, today I want to talk about the rise of the pass catching tight end. Tight ends have always been important, especially for young quarterbacks. They’re a safety valve. If there are no open receivers down field, quarterbacks know that if they have a good tight end, they will be able to dump the ball off for a short gain. But this season it seems as if there are more elite pass catching tight ends than ever before, which is also good from a fantasy perspective.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The increase in productive tight ends is due to two aspects of today’s game: the large amount of young quarterbacks and uncertain quarterback situations, and the developing trend of teams carrying two capable tight ends on their rosters. For fantasy owners, this means that there is unprecedented depth at a normally shallow position. So if you have an injured starter or missed out on top tier tight ends such as the Patriots’ Aaron Hernandez and Rob Gronkowski, Jason Witten, Jermichael Finley, or Antonio Gates, there are plenty of serviceable tight ends out there that will help your team.</p>\n<p>In addition to the established top tier tight ends, this season has seen the emergence of players like New Orleans’ Jimmy Graham, who has the second most fantasy points of any tight end in ESPN standard leagues, behind only Gronkowski. Even tight ends that don’t rack up a lot of yards each game can help you from a fantasy perspective, because when teams get into the red zone, there is nothing a quarterback likes more than a strong, sure-handed tight end. Buffalo’s Scott Chandler has only had more than 16  receiving yards in one game thus far, but he still has the ninth-most fantasy points amongst tight ends because he has scored four touchdowns through four games.</p>\n<p>There are an astounding 14 tight ends that have scored at least two touchdowns through the first four weeks, and all of them are receiving multiple looks from their respective quarterbacks each week. Chandler, and other options such as Cincinnati’s Jermaine Gresham, who has two touchdowns and is 11th in points among tight ends, is a viable option that can help your team. The point is, if you need help at tight end, you don’t have to look far. Help is out there and it is more abundant than ever.</p>\n<p>Pick Up of the Week: I’ve got two for you this week: WR David Nelson of the Buffalo Bills and RB Stevan Ridley of the New England Patriots. Nelson is essentially the Bills’ version of Wes Welker. He won’t get quite as many touchdowns or quite the same yardage, but Ryan Fitzpatrick loves throwing to him and that’s a good thing in that high powered offense. As for Ridley, it’s always risky to trust a Patriots running back, but Belichick seems to love Ridley and he’s shown better burst and power than BenJarvus Green-Ellis so far.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus <em>NFL columnist Joshua Greenberg has more depth to him than the tight end position this year.
