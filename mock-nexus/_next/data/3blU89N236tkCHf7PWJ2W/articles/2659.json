UCSB has accommodated disabled students in the past through a bus service in the 1960s and a tram service in the 1990s, but both programs ended due to budgetary reasons.</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator, C.O.D.E. liaison and second-year undeclared major Natalie Jordan had the idea for the project after suffering an injury that left her wheelchair-bound for six weeks.</p>\n<p>“Disabled students, both permanent and temporary, have been overlooked due to the misunderstanding that ADA [Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990] compliance has solved all the issues confronting disabled persons, when in fact there is much to accomplish,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Jordan said she plans to establish additional services for disabled students while in office.</p>\n<p>“I have high hopes to create a Medical Equipment Loan Closet for temporarily disabled students in addition to a new Disabled Students Study Room in the library,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major David Ashalou said he fractured bones in his left knee last year and had to walk to class on crutches.</p>\n<p>“The only problem I have with this project is that it didn’t come sooner,” said Ashaolu. “It was so hard to motivate myself to get up and go to class because every walk to school felt like a marathon.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year political science major Austin Hechler said UCSB does not have sufficient disability services.</p>\n<p>“How is a person on crutches supposed to make it from 66 or 67 DP to class at a reasonable time?” Hechler said. “Furthermore, renting equipment is really expensive and consequently leaves students with no options to get to class or around campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Hechler, A.S. is relying on funds from the parking lock-in fee to operate ATP.</p>\n<p>“It seems every time students demand services, whether it be mental health councilors, disabled person transportation or other initiatives that students demand from their institution, the University looks upon the students to fund it through lock-ins and additional student fees,” Hechler said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Last year, UCSB American Red Cross held a bake sale to raise money for victims of the earthquake in Nepal.</p>\n<p>Internal vice president of UCSB American Red Cross and third-year biology major Allie Liu said she hopes UCSB will come out and support the Red Cross’s attempts to help Syrian refugees.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to support the Syrian refugees,” Liu said. “The American Red Cross, along with UNHCR, is providing food, shelter and anything that these people who are coming from a country in chaos may need.”</p>\n<p>President of UCSB American Red Cross and fourth-year biology major Heather Halaweh said students really like the bake sale and ask questions about the refugees overseas.</p>\n<p>“When we do the bake sale, we try to choose something that’s current, and we want something that a lot of people care about because it’s an occurrence that is happening on such a large scale,” Halaweh said.</p>\n<p>According to Halaweh, the American Red Cross is working to pair new refugees with other refugees who have been in the country for a while to provide an understanding of what it’s like to come from a war zone.</p>\n<p>“They help them assimilate, so I think that’s really cool,” Halaweh said.<br>\nFourth-year global studies major Arivanh Onevathana said she was excited to hear the Syrian Refugee Bake Sale was taking place.</p>\n<p>“We are always looking out for others and are very aware of what is currently happening in the world around us,” Onevathana said. “I was stoked to see the creative baked goods only being sold for a dollar because what better way to support by contributing to the cause than to enjoy delicious pastries at the same time? It’s a nice way for UCSB students to send aid during this time of crisis.”</p>\n<p>Halaweh said the bake sale is one of her favorite events the club hosts because fundraising is one of the three main tenants that the club adheres to in addition to volunteering and offering certification courses.</p>\n<p>“It just feels good to raise money for Syrians refugees who have been huge on the news recently,” Halaweh said. “It’s great to see the campus come out and support them.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65428\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/bake-sale-raises-funds-for-syrian-refugees-in-need/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65428\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/bake-sale-raises-funds-for-syrian-refugees-in-need/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/bake-sale-raises-funds-for-syrian-refugees-in-need/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/bake-sale-raises-funds-for-syrian-refugees-in-need/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/bake-sale-raises-funds-for-syrian-refugees-in-need/","id":2657,"author":{"id":117,"name":"Effie Sklavenitis"},"related":[2656,2655,2654],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"USC Professor Jody David Armour Gives MCC Lecture on Art and the Black Lives Matter Movement","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Redemption_Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Redemption_Jenny-Luo-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Jody David Armour, the Roy P.

Crocker Professor at USC Gould School of Law, discussed the importance of art in relation to the Black Lives Matter movement in a lecture titled “Race, Rap, and Redemption: The Role of Art in Promoting Racial Justice” at the MultiCultural Center (MCC) Thursday evening.</p>\n<p>During the lecture, Armour explored how art forms such as gangster rap, shed light on important issues including racial profiling, police brutality and mass incarceration. Armour has been a member of USC’s faculty since 1995 and studies several topics regarding relationships between racial justice, criminal justice and law enforcement. The lecture is part of MCC’S “Race Matters” series, which focuses on the role of racism and race in our society.</p>\n<p>Armour began the lecture by outlining racial profiling and the various social injustices it causes. According to Armour, the indignity and embarrassment of being racially profiled can be likened to “murdering an individual’s spirit.” Amour said the case of Sandra Bland, a Black woman who died in police custody in July, illustrates the damages of racial profiling.</p>\n<p>“Before Sandra Bland died, she was spirit-murdered,” Armour said. “Whoever took her life, whether it was by her hands or their hands, she had been spirit murdered to lead up to that suicide.”</p>\n<p>According to Armour, influential figures in the black community perpetuate negative attitudes toward Black men, such as Bill Cosby lecturing young black men on “pulling up their pants” and “naming their kids right.” Armour also said he employs the word “nigga” to emphasize problematic issues in the Black community.</p>\n<p>“The reason why I use that term to talk about social issues is because it gets at a mentality in the Black community that is very ugly and needs to change,” Armour said.</p>\n<p>Armour said the first time he gave the “Race, Rap, and Redemption” lecture was in USC’s Bovard auditorium to discuss the Stanley Tookie Williams case. During the event, guests used dance and music to express their opinions of the trial.</p>\n<p>“If you want to reach people at a visceral level, I find that art is the most effective way to get people to begin to empathize with people they might otherwise not find anything in common with at all,” Armour said.</p>\n<p>According to Armour, rap is a form of art that addresses racial profiling and police brutality in a way most other music does not. Amour said rap groups Public Enemy and NWA showed the perspective of Black persons in police brutality cases.</p>\n<p>“This is profound stuff in the profane. You have coarse brutal language to describe a coarse brutal reality,” Armour said. “It was a political oppositional discourse as profane as you can imagine.”</p>\n<p>According to a member of an African-American women’s sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha Charlotte A. Gullap-Moore, one reason for the prevalence of racial insensitivity is the lack of Black history education in U.S. schools.</p>\n<p>“The more education you have the more currency you have,” Moore said. “The reason why Public Enemy was so relevant was because they educated themselves on Black history, which is not disseminated in the school system.”</p>\n<p>Moore said Black history education should be introduced to schools beginning in primary school.</p>\n<p>“This is a process that should be implemented since kindergarten, not just for Black people but for all people because then it will limit cultural insensitivity,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>MCC Program Coordinator Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said the “Race Matters” lecture series will continue throughout the school year.</p>\n<p>“We have great programs and I couldn’t be more thrilled with the calendar,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “This lecture [Race Rap and Redemption] was a way to kick-off the incoming year in a really critical, academic, engaging way.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article previously stated Charlotte A. Gullap-Moore is a representative of an African-American women’s sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha. While Gullap-Moore is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha did not attend the lecture on behalf of the sorority.

Senator Bernie Sanders as he seeks the Democratic presidential nomination, is hosting “Chalk-the-Block” Thursday at 4 p.m. to imprint Isla Vista with images and words promoting Sanders’ campaign.</p>\n<p>The goal of the event is to cover I.V. streets and sidewalks with slogans and pictures of Sanders to bring attention to his campaign. As of Oct. 27, the event’s Facebook page shows 243 people plan to attend. UCSB-4-Bernie strategically planned the event two days before Halloween to take advantage of the large crowds over the holiday weekend and maximize views of the chalk.</p>\n<p>Third-year religious studies major Eric Daniel Villalobos said he helped plan the event and UCSB students who support Sanders plan to chalk phrases and questions relevant to Sanders’ campaign, such as, “Are the banks too big?”</p>\n<p>“We’re going to be chalking — along with pictures and slogans — questions like, ‘Is education a right or only for a privileged few?’” Villalobos said. “Hopefully, all the people walking through I.V. during the weekend will stop and notice.”</p>\n<p>According to Villalobos, the aim of the event is to build support for Sanders at UCSB and in I.V. and to encourage young people to engage in politics.</p>\n<p>“We want [to] build on the energy we see here for Bernie’s message and campaign,” Villalobos said. “We want all the supporters here to get energized, to get involved and be active participants in the political process.”</p>\n<p>Villalobos said all students are welcome to participate in the event.</p>\n<p>“All they have to do is show up,” Villalobos said. “In terms of the event, if they want to bring their own chalk, they’re more than welcome to.”</p>\n<p>Villalobos also said he believes college students are supportive of Sanders because of his stance on topics like college tuition and various social issues.</p>\n<p>“Fighting for free public education doesn’t hurt your standing with college students,” Villalobos said. “He seems to have always been on the right side of history. He got arrested for holding anti-segregation rallies, he marched with MLK, he endorsed marriage equality decades before it became politically expedient to do so.”</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Nicole Truong said the event allows people to get to know other individuals who share their beliefs and ideas.</p>\n<p>“I’m looking forward to seeing people at the event who share the same views as me, and I’m interested in meeting new people and hearing their thoughts and opinions,” Truong said in an email.</p>\n<p>Second-year communication and economics double major Cynthia Jiang said the event is a good opportunity learn from fellow Sanders supporters.</p>\n<p>“I’m looking forward to meeting fellow Bernie supporters and getting new perspectives from others on issues that surround the presidential election,” Jiang said.</p>\n<p>Jiang said she hopes participants and community members who see the chalk will recognize student’s grassroots efforts.</p>\n<p>“What really stuck out to me about Bernie’s campaign and what I hope people will learn about the most is that you can always make a change if you’re dedicated enough to your cause,” Jiang said.</p>\n<p>First-year sociology major Logan Clement said the public should better understand Bernie Sanders’ stance of “democratic socialism,” which is defined as a specific type of socialism which supports public ownership of the production of goods paired with a democratic political system.</p>\n<p>“I like that [Sanders] is pushing for affordable health care and education. I also wish more people understood what Sanders means by ‘democratic socialism’ rather than using that language to disengage from his message,” Clement said in an email. “He’s also one of the most outspoken advocates of racial justice.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65873\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/student-group-to-chalk-the-block-for-bernie-sanders/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65873\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/student-group-to-chalk-the-block-for-bernie-sanders/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/student-group-to-chalk-the-block-for-bernie-sanders/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/student-group-to-chalk-the-block-for-bernie-sanders/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/student-group-to-chalk-the-block-for-bernie-sanders/","id":2656,"author":{"id":127,"name":"Amy Koo"},"related":[2655,2654,2653],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
