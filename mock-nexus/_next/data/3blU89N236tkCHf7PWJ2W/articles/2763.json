This year, that time was cut down by a month.</p>\n<p>Besides preparation issues, Bishop said that conflicting fundraising relief aid for the Thomas Fire and Montecito mudslides was another factor in the drop in donations.</p>\n<p>Although he hadn’t cross-checked KCSB’s donor list, he guessed that the previous contributors were providing more towards relief efforts.</p>\n<p>“Some people weren’t really comfortable donating to us when there’s other causes for direct relief,” he said.</p>\n<p>The radio station’s event faced another roadblock with the adoption of a last-minute advertising pitch to contribute 10 percent of every $1,000 dollars collected by KCSB to the Direct Relief organization assisting in aid for areas affected by the fires and Montecito mudslides.</p>\n<p>This pledge required KCSB to tiptoe over university warnings and get an official invoice from Direct Relief in order to fulfill that promise.</p>\n<p>According to Bishop, “The university didn’t want us to act as agents of [Direct Relief]. We can’t say we’re ‘donating’ 10 percent. We have to say we’re contributing to them, but not on their behalf.”</p>\n<p>Despite conflict and delays, the radio station continued the fund drive that consisted of 24-hour radio shows that asked listeners to donate. They also offered listeners “thank you gifts” like vinyl records, concert tickets and others.</p>\n<p>KCSB also sponsored festival events in downtown Santa Barbara and hosted an open-mic night fundraiser in Goleta.</p>\n<p>After contributing 10 percent of every $1,000 raised to the Direct Relief organization, the remaining funds will be used to pay for special projects and community events throughout the year that are sponsored by KCSB Radio.</p>\n<p>Despite the challenges, Bishop is satisfied with everything he and his team put together.</p>\n<p>“In the grand scheme of things, 23k is pretty good and I’m really proud of everyone I’m working with, especially given the circumstances,” he said.</p>\n<p>While the official fundraiser has ended, online donations will still be collected until March 16, through PayPal and Network for Good.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the March 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of the story stated KCSB would donate “10 percent to the Direct Relief organization.” The station will donate 10 percent of every $1,000 raised. The story also stated Bishop referred to KCSB’s 2017 donor list and “contested” that the donors were now putting money toward relief efforts. Bishop said he hadn’t cross-checked the donors between this year and last and he only “guessed” that the donors were contributing money elsewhere.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81850\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/kcsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81850\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/kcsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/kcsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/kcsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/kcsb/","id":2763,"author":{"id":224,"name":"Spencer Sween"},"related":[2762,2761,2760],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":224,"name":"Spencer Sween","biography":"Not available","articles":[2327,2763,4344],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Freshmen Feature: Newbies Play Beyond Their Years","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"While senior utilities Milos Golic and Zsombor Vincze have taken much of the spotlight this season because of their status as two of the best utilities in the nation, much of the team’s success is o...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The #5 UCSB men’s water polo team has begun its season 5-2, outscoring its opponents 71-41 in the process.

The 6’3” driver has five goals to go along with 15 assists in seven games this season.</p>\n<p>“He is a powerhouse on the right side,” Golic said. “He will really help us.”</p>\n<p>With aspirations to play for the Australian National team, Gronow had his first breakout game against #7 Pacific in the NorCal Tournament at UC Berkeley on Sept. 19, where he netted a hat-trick to lead the Gauchos to an 11-6 victory.</p>\n<p>“It was a very promising performance,” Golic said.</p>\n<p>Like Gronow, Komadinic’s road to UCSB began outside of the country. The Serbian native began playing water polo at a young age and was a member of the Serbian Junior National Team.</p>\n<p>“His English is real bad,” Vincze said. “But he is actually really funny.”</p>\n<p>Komadinic plays center back, a position described by polo players as one of the toughest in the game. However, the freshman has been doing a commendable job, impressing the teams’ top guns.</p>\n<p>“He’s a really good player,” Golic said. “He is able to push other team’s 2-meters back and that pushes their whole offense back.”</p>\n<p><span><div id=\"attachment_26453\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">[media-credit name=”Photo Courtesy of Matt Gronow” align=”alignright” width=”250″]<a href=\"http://www.dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/freshmen-feature-newbies-play-years/usethis/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-26453\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-26453\" data-attachment-id=\"26453\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/freshmen-feature-newbies-play-years/usethis/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS.jpg?fit=1956%2C1551&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1956,1551\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"13\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D300\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1284206935\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"125\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"USETHIS\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS.jpg?fit=250%2C198&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS.jpg?fit=888%2C704&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS-250x198.jpg?resize=250%2C198\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"198\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-26453\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS.jpg?resize=250%2C198&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS.jpg?resize=1024%2C812&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS.jpg?w=1956&amp;ssl=1 1956w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]<p id=\"caption-attachment-26453\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Freshman 2-meter defender Lazar Komadinic pushes the ball up the pool.

He has committed several penalties in his first season as a Gaucho, including an ejection in the team’s last game against #6 UC Irvine within the first three minutes of the first period.</p>\n<p>“He’s a little too aggressive,” said Golic, who also comes from Serbia. “He’ll need a few more games to adjust.”</p>\n<p>Teammates consider Komadinic funny — sometimes because of his struggles with English.</p>\n<p>“We all make fun of him for it,” Gronow said. “But we try to help him when we can.”</p>\n<p>Still, Komadinic has fit well with the team.</p>\n<p>“He’s actually a really chill guy,” Vincze said.</p>\n<p>Out of the pool, Gronow has a tendency to talk in his sleep. He also sleepwalks, including one alleged incident in which Vincze woke up to Gronow standing over him.</p>\n<p>“He was in a bear pose, ready to attack,” Vincze said.</p>\n<p>Of the incident, Gronow claims he was awake and thought he was escaping spiders in his bed.</p>\n<p>“I think [my sleepwalking] used to shock him,” Gronow said. “But now he’s used to it.”</p>\n<p>Gronow, Komadinic and the rest of the Gaucho squad are currently preparing for the SoCal Tournament, which will be held at UCLA beginning Oct. 2. There, the team may have another chance to play Stanford, who has beaten UCSB in each of their past three meetings.</p>\n<p>“Our ultimate team goal is a national title,” Gronow said.</p><div

Department of Public Health’s Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses Weekly Report for Jan. 7 to 13, 2018 reported that Influenza A (H3N2) viruses are more widespread  this season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Influenza A (H3N2) strain tends to cause larger outbreaks compared to other strains of the flu, according to data from the Center for Disease Control and Santa Barbara County Public Health Department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ali Javanbakht, the medical director at UCSB Student Health, said Cottage Hospital in Goleta has seen a sharp rise in the number of flu cases. Other hospitals in counties across California are experiencing elevated numbers of cases as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At least 20,000 people die in the U.S. from the flu every year, according to Javanbakht. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As of now, improving flu vaccination rates is our best bet at reducing that number,” Javanbakht said in an email. “We’re always looking for ways to boost flu vaccination rates at UCSB since there are a lot of people on campus in close quarters, which can really lend itself to an outbreak.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between Aug. 1, 2017 and Jan. 23, 2018, UCSB Student Health administered 1,862 flu vaccines. In the same time period last year, UCSB Student Health had administered 1,794  vaccinations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help boost these rates, UCSB Student Health offers flu vaccination clinics. Their walk-in hours are Monday through Friday, from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. An express flu clinic is also available by appointment and is held on Friday afternoons from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The California Department of Public Health said vaccinating is the best protection against the influenza virus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s hard for young, healthy college students to feel the need to get the flu vaccine, but getting a flu vaccine yourself helps protect your ‘tribe’ Javanbakht said in an email. “By getting vaccinated, you become one fewer entry points of the flu virus into your circle of friends, roommates, classmates, significant others, and family members.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There would be a drastic decrease in the number of flu cases if 95 percent of the campus were vaccinated, according to Javanbakht.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This would mean fewer missed class days, fewer missed exercise days, fewer missed socializing days, and more healthcare resources available to tend to other ill or injured students,” he said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is still possible to catch the flu if a person receives the flu vaccine, Javanbakht said those who are vaccinated and fall ill tend to be ill for a shorter amount of time and experience less extreme symptoms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht reported that the majority of the flu cases UCSB Student Health sees are in students who haven’t received the vaccine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to wash hands often, cover coughs and sneezes and stay home when sick in order to stop the spread of the flu. Javanbakht also said using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer to clean your hands is effective, especially before eating. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Taking care when touching surfaces where the flu virus can reside, such as doorknobs, tables, pens, paper, ATM, keyboards, etc., and using a hand sanitizer after doing so can also be very effective,” Javanbakht said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He explained that “getting enough sleep, eating healthy meals and exercising regularly all help to keep the immune system functioning better overall.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

the Womxn’s Commission</em></p></div>\n<p>Womxn of color and their allies came together for this year’s Womxn of Color Conference on Saturday, Feb. 3, to discuss the issues minority womxn face with media representation, mental health and generational trauma.</p>\n<p>This year’s theme, “From Ashes to Activism: Rise through Resistance,” was reflected in the speakers, workshops and caucus spaces held throughout the day. The Associated Students Womxn’s Commission hosted the event.</p>\n<p>Ilene Ochoa, a fourth-year sociology major and senate liaison to the Womxn’s Commission, said the event was important for womxn of color in the present political climate.</p>\n<p>“The board liked the idea of rising from the ashes, being reborn like a phoenix, because even though you’ve gone through hardships, you still come out strong,” Ochoa said in an email.</p>\n<p>Zahira Kelly-Cabrera, an Afro-Dominicana writer, artist and international speaker, kicked off the event with a compelling speech about being an Afro-Latina.</p>\n<p>Kelly-Cabrera talked about her struggles with self-identity and with being marginalized even within her own Latinx community. She told a story of resilience amidst the hate she received from individuals who disapproved of her voicing self-acceptance as a womxn of color.</p>\n<p>She also discussed self-growth and resistance despite her experiences of toxic relationships and feeling like she did not belong to any community.</p>\n<p>Many attendees considered the speaker a highlight of the conference.</p>\n<p>“I enjoyed the keynote speaker [because] the space was intimate and powerful when she was sharing her story,” Ochoa said.</p>\n<p>Two workshop sessions succeeded Kelly-Cabrera.</p>\n<p>Sessions A and B featured various workshops focusing on topics such as mental health healing and effectively using radio as a platform for womxn of color to make their voices heard.</p>\n<p>Deborah Williams, a second-year political science major, attended a workshop called “Revolutionary Motherhood And Growing Up In The Movement: Two Generations Of Transnational Feminists.”</p>\n<p>“I got a better understanding of women’s roles and how they are changing today and how my mothers and grandmothers role differ from how I’m going to pursue my role as a mother,” Williams said. “I am going to foster that new generation with male and female equality.”</p>\n<p>KCSB-FM’s Radio Xicana host, Cecilia, lead the workshop called “Navigating the AirWaves: Muxeres en Radio.”</p>\n<p>She said her passion for the workshop stemmed from exploring the construct of identity through a more authentic platform in comparison to media representation.</p>\n<p>Hour-long caucus spaces, which are safe spaces for different identifications to bond over shared experiences, followed the sessions.</p>\n<p>Adena Badawi, an attendee from Orange County, explained the importance behind the caucuses.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it’s really important for womxn of color to have an outlet where we can all come together and share our experiences and form connections, and I’ve definitely accomplished that today through all the great people like me that I’ve met,” said Badawi.</p>\n<p>Attendees expanded on why the Womxn of Color Conference plays a key role in the fight for equality.</p>\n<p>Williams added that it was vital for college campuses to raise awareness and encourage participation in events such as this.</p>\n<p>“I think by coming to these conferences, I’m able to see more people like myself and relate to their experiences,” Samantha Mejia, a second-year sociology major, said.</p>\n<p>Maria Gonzales, a second-year global studies major, discussed the role that the Womxn of Color Conference plays on campus.</p>\n<p>Gonzales explained that UCSB has a lack of safe spaces for students of color on campus and said students of color often do not feel a sense of belonging in higher institutions.</p>\n<p>Though the majority of attendees were minority womxn, a few allies attended in order to show their support, get educated and gain perspective.</p>\n<p>“Men don’t support womxn very well so I feel like I need to step up and be an example to other men, and I need to learn how to do that properly,” Fred Atef, a visitor from Orange County, said.</p>\n<p>The Womxn’s Commission considered the day as a success, and Ochoa said that the event re-motivated her to continue her work as a political activism.</p>\n<p>“I see how important this work is in our community and how it can empower other womxn of color,” Ochoa said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
