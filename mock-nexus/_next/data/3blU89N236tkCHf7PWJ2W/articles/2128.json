The last time he pitched a full season was back in 2005, when he posted a 1.16 WHIP and a 3.48 ERA. Since then, he has not been able to log more than 99.1 innings in a season and has managed an ERA under four just once, when he pitched seven games for Boston in 2008. Maybe this is the second coming of Bartolo, but I think he is going to start to regress, and soon.</p>\n<p>Bud Norris, SP, Houston Astros: 2 wins, 3.16 ERA, 52 strikeouts</p>\n<p>This is only Norris’ third season in the majors, so he may be reaching his potential, but it just seems too drastically different from his previous two seasons, in which he posted very similar stats. His ERA is almost two runs lower than it was last season, and his 52 strikeouts put him on pace to far exceed the 158 he posted in 27 starts a year ago. Add that to a lower walk rate, and you get a player who seems to have reinvented himself in the course of one offseason. Like I said, he may have simply found his stride, but I would be very surprised if he didn’t end the season with an ERA a lot closer to four.</p>\n<p>Matt Joyce, OF, Tampa Bay Rays: .356 AVG, 3 HR, 14 RBI</p>\n<p>Joyce’s current stats are so out of line with what he posted in his previous three seasons that the only possible conclusion is that he is riding a very long hot streak. Joyce is a career .262 hitter and has never hit for an average higher than .252 before this season. Similarly, his current OPS (.956), slugging percentage (.554) and on-base percentage (.356) are much higher than anything he’s posted before. He’s due to come back down to earth soon, and the fall could hit owners who trusted him very hard indeed.</p>\n<p>Russell Martin, C, New York Yankees: .255 AVG, 6 HR, 20 RBI</p>\n<p>For those of you who picked Martin up when he was hitting over .300 and are holding on to him in case he brings his average back up, forget it. Martin has not hit over .250 since 2008. His on-base percentage (.358) is also settling into the area that it has been in for the last three seasons. The only thing that’s keeping him a viable option is his .500 slugging percentage, but that’s due to come down as well, as the last time he even slugged better than .400 was 2007.</p>\n<p>Daisuke Matsuzaka, SP, Boston Red Sox: 3 wins, 24 strikeouts, 4.64 ERA</p>\n<p>Daisuke has allowed two or fewer runs in four of his last five starts (though one of those was only one inning) and has started to walk fewer batters. However, he let up four runs in six innings in his last start and two runs in a one inning appearance against the Angels four days earlier. He has posted an ERA under 4.40 once in his career with the Red Sox, and I believe that his ERA will settle about where it is for the rest of the season. If you picked him up thinking that he was going to keep throwing gems like the one he threw against the Angels on April 23 or against the Blue Jays on April 18, you are out of luck.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus fantasy sports columnist Josh Greenberg likes lists.

It is no fluke that LBJ has led the NBA in Player Efficiency Rating in each of the last four seasons. He has better shot selection, vision and is the ultimate team player. The King attacks the rim more violently than anyone, forcing defenses to collapse while freeing up open looks for his teammates.

He is the most athletic specimen the game has ever seen. At 6’ 8” and 270 pounds, he has the most unique blend of size, strength, speed, instincts and jaw-dropping athleticism to ever grace the court. His ability to play and guard 1 through 4 while demonstrating more consistent defensive intensity than Kobe also makes him much more versatile.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LeBron, at just 26 years of age, has played seven fewer seasons and roughly one-third the numbers of playoff games as Kobe. This is important to consider simply because he has had far less opportunities to make big shots, or shine in “clutch” situations as Kobe is so over-glorified for.</p>\n<p>Moreover, using the NBA’s measure of clutch play — the final five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime with a margin of five points or fewer — LeBron has again proved to be far more efficient than the Black Mamba in each of the last four seasons. Believe it or not, when Kobe is on the floor in crunch time, his Lakers are actually outscored by their opponents.</p>\n<p>In fact, LeBron has actually performed better than Kobe at the end of tight playoff games. Over the course of Kobe’s playoff career, he has connected on five of 20 attempts when having the opportunity to make a potential game-tying or go-ahead field goal in the final 10 seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime, (or 25 percent compared to the league average over the same time of 28 percent). Conversely, LBJ has made five of 12 of these same shots during his playoff career (41.7 percent).</p>\n<p>When the two have met head to head, it is yet another landslide victory for King James. James-led teams are 9-5 when meeting with Kobe’s, while playing most of those games on teams with far inferior talent. Bryant has also benefited from playing for the most decorated coach in NBA history. During that infamous 2004-05 season, with Coach Phil Jackson on vacation and Lamar Odom, Caron Butler and Chucky Atkins as his sidekicks, Kobe led his team to a miserable 34-48 record and an 11th place finish in the Western Conference.</p>\n<p>James, on a team with comparable talent in 2009, led Mo Williams, Zydrunas Ilgauskas and co. to 66 wins. Also intriguing, this season the Cavs, with a vast majority of their roster still intact, stumbled to a pathetic 19-63 record in their first year without King James — finishing dead last in the Eastern Conference.</p>\n<p>Hate him or love him, LeBron is the most dominant player in the game today. Though Bryant does have five titles to his name, we are not measuring who is the most decorated, but rather who is the best.  LeBron is the best, and frankly, has been for the last four years.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Daily Nexus<em> reporter Tyler Hayden will be tweeting the night away after Ravi’s response.</em></p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-84758\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Food for All Coalition held its first meeting at the Biko Garage on Friday. <em>Laila Voss / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The coalition – made up of various students groups dedicated to fighting food insecurity – was created last October following the UCSB Food Security and Sustainable Food Systems Leadership Retreat.</p>\n<p>“[The retreat] was awesome; it was having everyone together because that never happens [and] we were drafting different ideas,” Michaela Austin said, a fourth-year sociology and environmental studies double major and student ambassador for the UC Global Food Initiative, said.</p>\n<p>The retreat brought together student organizations including the Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank, CalFresh, the UC Global Food Initiative, the Edible Campus Program, FoodCycling, Food, Nutrition, and Basic Skills Program, the Food Security Taskforce Student Reps, ECOalition and Food Security Peer Advisors.</p>\n<p>For Austin, who presided over Friday’s meeting, the goal of the coalition was obvious.</p>\n<p>“[The purpose is] very simple. Update each other, build coalition[s] and again, the goal is to get food insecurity on campus to as low a rate as possible,” Austin said. “If there is a problem we all agree on, let’s go to the UC with a unified voice.”</p>\n<p>Some of the positive updates and successful programs on- and off-campus were discussed at the opening of the meeting as well.</p>\n<p>Gabriel Etaat highlighted the achievements of the CalFresh Advocacy Team and the A.S. Food Bank. He explained that the CalFresh Advocacy Team had over 76 engagement activities during Fall Quarter 2018, which included tabling and enrollment parties.</p>\n<p>“We got well over 2,000 people enrolled in CalFresh that we know of through the program and this year’s benchmark is 6,000,” Etaat, a fourth-year economics and environmental studies double major and USDA Food Insecurity Research intern, said.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, several students also discussed the accessibility of food security and sustainability programs are to underserved students. Marilu Bedolla, a fourth-year language, culture and society major, noted that Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients are unable to access CalFresh.</p>\n<p>Due to their ineligibility for the federal program, which has no locally funded alternative, undocumented students remain neglected, Marilu emphasized.</p>\n<p>“That is a constant issue that we don’t know what to do with it. CalFresh pulls in a huge amount of resources into this campus, but again, because undocumented students are not eligible for that, what do we do?” Austin replied.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“CalFresh pulls in a huge amount of resources into this campus, but again, because undocumented students are not eligible for that, what do we do?”</p></blockquote>\n<p>“Right now, the main things we have been pushing [are] what we do have on campus, which are the food pantries and free prepared meals.”</p>\n<p>Jack Greenberg, a third-year cultural anthropology major and employee at the I.V. Food Co-op, brought up the possibility of having a plot of land in the <a href=\"http://ucsbosl.orgsync.com/org/ghgp/home\">Greenhouse and Garden project</a> to serve the undocumented population.</p>\n<p>“One of my friends is looking to start an undocumented plot in the Greenhouse and Garden project … hopefully that will be a resource also where it can be already paid for and once it grows actual food can be [made available].”</p>\n<p>Those in attendance also expressed concern about CalFresh availability at on-campus convenience stores, stating that the Arbor remains the only on-campus institution to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsbs-arbor-now-accepting-calfresh/\">accept the program</a>.</p>\n<p>The lack of whole foods, particularly raw fruits and vegetables, at the Arbor was another point of concern with food availability for CalFresh recipients.</p>\n<p>Students also discussed the closure of the UC Global Food Initiative, which was intended as a short-term kickstart for campuses to address food security.</p>\n<p>“We still have to do that work; we want [those programs] to be funded — it’s not a given,” Austin noted.</p>\n<p>The Food for All Coalition is in the process of becoming a permanent standing committee under A.S. with support from A.S. Senators Anthony Hernandez, Rafael Cornejo, Gabriella Shofet and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/\">Sydney Karmes-Wainer</a>.</p>\n<p>“We accept everyone who wants to come, whether they’re on-campus organizations or off-campus organizations [and] as a standing committee under A.S., you get all the benefits of A.S. as well,” Hernandez said.</p>\n<p>Hernandez wants to work on increasing turnout for the meetings. He noted his concerns about having a low turnout of students since the meetings are scheduled for Fridays.</p>\n<p>“We thought about having a night market while we have the meeting since it’s Friday night and people are going to [Del Playa]… We want to build a culture around it, so that way people know about [Food for All].”</p>\n<p>The Food for All Coalition holds biweekly Friday meetings at Biko Garage from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>Caleb Brown is a reporter at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calebbrown/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Caleb Brown</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Caleb Brown is a reporter for the Daily Nexus.
