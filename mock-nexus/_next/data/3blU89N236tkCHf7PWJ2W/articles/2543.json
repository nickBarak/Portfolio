He said he knew his family was Jewish only because it was “written on the I.D. of your parents” and because of “all the conversations about anti-Semitism and discrimination.”</p>\n<p>Sharansky said being a Jew at the time was like being “born with some very rare disease,” and the only “medicine” was being the best at your trade.</p>\n<p>“Your parents are telling to you, because you are Jewish, everywhere — in school, in university, in kindergarten — you must be number one,” Sharansky said. “In physics or mathematics or in chess or in music or in dance, whatever, it doesn’t matter, you must be the best at your profession. That is the way how we Jews survive.”</p>\n<p>Sharansky said many Jewish people felt a sense of community after the Six-Day War of 1967 — when Israel gained the upper hand against the Soviet Union and its Egyptian and Syrian allies —leading to increased activism among Jews.</p>\n<p>After the war in 1967, Sharansky said, “Israel entered our lives very powerfully because the victory of Israel over allies of the Soviet Union was a huge humiliation for the Soviet Union.”</p>\n<p>Sharansky said, following the Six-Day War, he realized the importance of his connection to the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“Suddenly, you find out, you discover that all the people around you, your friends and your enemies, they all connect you to the Israeli army,” Sharansky said.</p>\n<p>Douglas said after his son’s bar mitzvah, his family visited the Western Wall in Jerusalem, after which the Genesis Prize Foundation recognized his commitment to the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“A few pictures were taken; it made the Israeli press,” Douglas said. “The next thing I know, the Genesis group contacts me and presents this incredible prize, this opportunity which I was truly touched because I felt I was part of a tribe.”</p>\n<p>Douglas said the Israeli government opened a permanent egalitarian prayer space earlier this week at the Western Wall.</p>\n<p>“That is the place where Jews are coming for 3,000 years to talk to God and at the same time; it is the number-one national symbol,” Sharansky said.</p>\n<p>Sharansky said years of negotiations have resulted in the understanding that even though some compromises regarding the Wall may be painful, the unity of Jewish people is more important.</p>\n<p>“For me, it is very important that we as a Jewish community always will be open and welcoming for those who are invested,” Sharansky said.</p>\n<p>Douglas said the Jewish people have reason to be optimistic about their history and the future.</p>\n<p>“It is a sense of community, and I have been deeply inspired by my son and by my father,” Douglas said. “So I see and feel a continuity of generations, a sense of immortality. I am hopeful and optimistic.”</p>\n<p>During the Q&amp;A segment of the event, April Savage, third-year biology major, asked about interfaith climates on college campuses. Douglas responded by encouraging discussion of controversial subjects.</p>\n<p>“People always say, ‘don’t talk about politics or religion and you will always get along.’ I would encourage a dialogue and being able to open up and expose yourself and have the support of Hillel behind you,” Douglas said, referring to the Jewish nonprofit student group.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Evan Goodman, executive director of Santa Barbara Hillel, said UCSB has more Jewish undergraduate students than any other UC campus and that 160 students traveled to Israel on birthright trips last year.</p>\n<p>Andrew Packer, third-year economics and accounting major, described his experience with Santa Barbara Hillel and his birthright experience.</p>\n<p>“For me, Santa Barbara Hillel has enabled me to reconnect with my Jewish roots,” Packer said. “It allows me to continue my cultural exploration of Judaism and opens the dialogue on religion.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

This year, the conglomerate of volunteers hopes to register 8,000 people by May 23, the California registration deadline.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista is a place of transition in people’s lives,” said Jacob Lebell, a UCSB alumnus who is registering voters. “They come here to learn, to find themselves, to let other things go and become the people that they’re going to leave as. One of the things we really hope they become going forward is voters engaged in the political process.”</p>\n<p>Lebell is on staff for Joan Hartmann’s third district supervisor campaign, but he stressed that the voter registration effort itself is completely nonpartisan and said they do not ask for whom someone plans to vote.</p>\n<p>“Our biggest priority and value — far beyond partisanship — is that people are able to access their rights if they want,” Lebell said. “A person’s vote goes much further here than it goes back home. This is going to benefit I.V. beyond them.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70079\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70079\" data-attachment-id=\"70079\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/local-group-registers-more-than-2000-to-vote/voter-registration-april-18/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Voter-Registration_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Voter Registration April 18\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Voter-Registration_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Voter-Registration_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-70079\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Voter-Registration_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Jacob Lebell explains the registration process to Kevin Surnip.

Even Lebell’s aunt stopped by to help register voters.</p>\n<p>Abboud said people are eager to register because of the excitement surrounding the presidential race, but that the goal of the registration is to increase turnout for the third district supervisor elections.</p>\n<p>“The main purpose of this voting registration drive is not the president at all, but it’s the county supervisor election,” Abboud said, adding that the third district is “a swing district and the students have a major say.”</p>\n<p>Elijah Ettenger, a UCSB alumnus, is working with the conglomerate as a voter register for the county’s Democratic Party. He said encouraging people, especially students, to vote by mail is important, but that simply letting voters know the primary election is during finals week is most vital.</p>\n<p>“The vote-by-mail is a component but really it’s about letting [people] know that [the primary is] Tuesday during finals week and letting them make that decision, asking them what works for them as far as getting to the polls,” Ettenger said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College students, for example, will be out of school by the June 7 primary, meaning that many of them need to prepare to mail in their vote.</p>\n<p>The registration group is hoping that between 4,000 and 5,000 vote this year, nearly half of which they expect to vote by mail.</p>\n<p>After the June 7 primaries, many Isla Vistans will be changing their addresses, meaning that they will need to register again, likely under a different polling center.</p>\n<p>“Here, almost everyone moves every year,” Abboud said. “We start from zero on July 1, in our minds, and start again.”</p>\n<p><em><strong>Not sure if you’re registered? <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ucsbcanivote\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to check your status</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Want to help register others? <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ucsbvotes\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up to volunteer here</a>.</strong></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Police said shortly after turning the woman away, the apartment complex office received approximately 10 verbally abusive phone calls from who was believed to be the woman’s boyfriend.</p>\n<p>At approximately 2 a.m. a window at the office was broken. The Resident Coordinator thought the woman and her boyfriend were responsible for the damage and called the police.</p>\n<p>The next morning, UCPD officers questioned both suspects who then admitted to the abusive phone calls but denied breaking the window.

Officers said they could not charge the suspect with urinating in public because they did not witness the act.</p>\n<p>Tag ‘N Snag</p>\n<p>Friday, June 25, 3 p.m.: Officers received reports of five suspects spraying graffiti on a hand ball court next to the UCSB lacrosse field in broad daylight. When police arrived, the suspects fled on foot and four of the suspects were captured and arrested.</p>\n<p>Police later determined the suspects stole the spray paint from a nearby storage shed. The suspects were mostly minors from the Goleta area.

appropriation in today’s society. <em>Effie Sklavenitis / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The MultiCultural Center hosted a faculty-led panel discussion Tuesday evening to discuss cultural appropriation in today’s society.</p>\n<p>The panelists addressed critical issues and nuances between cultural appropriation, appreciation and assimilation. The event was followed by a fashion show highlighting culturally honored representations of self.</p>\n<p>Sociology professor and panel moderator Kum-Kum Bhavnani said culture does not reside within a person or group, but is defined by relationships.</p>\n<p>“The culture is created through our relationships with people … it isn’t a commodity that sits inside of us,” Bhavnani said. “Once you accept that, then you have to say, ‘Well what do we do about culture?’”</p>\n<p>Chican@ studies professor Micaela Diaz-Sanchez said intersectionality should propel this conversation.</p>\n<p>“When we are talking about the appropriation of race with regard to fashion, we should also always be thinking about gender and sexuality and class,” Diaz-Sanchez said. “Who is wearing what, in what context, and by whom is what we are wearing made?”</p>\n<p>English professor Felice Blake said Martin Luther King Jr. envisioned a colorblind world where people could exist in harmony and their “racial differences, appearances, etc. would not be a basis for discrimination.”</p>\n<p>According to Blake, Martin Luther King Jr.’s idea of colorblindness differs from the modern versions widely adopted today.</p>\n<p>“So more often than not, the argument for color blindness usually used to say, ‘Things are fair, everyone take the test and the scores will tell us who is the smart ones, who is deserving, who is worthy — and forget about the past,’” Blake said. “‘It is the people who keep bringing up race that causes the race problem. Aren’t we all supposed to be color blind?’”</p>\n<p>Blake said an important aspect of privilege is ensuring that someone does not feel they have encouraged a system of dominance.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to keep in mind the ways that someone can have privilege without feeling as if they have taken personally a part in producing a system of dominance,” Blake said.</p>\n<p>According to Blake, people oftentimes associate privilege with unearned advantage.</p>\n<p>“Advantages that one has, unearned, simply by virtue of the fact of how one was born — but those advantages come because someone else is receiving some unearned disadvantages at the same time,” Blake said.</p>\n<p>Blake said the reality of inequality is that one does not have to commit a heinous brutality against someone of color to participate in a system that is racist.</p>\n<p>“If you didn’t know before you got here: Sorry, the United States is a racist country,” Blake said.</p>\n<p>Blake said while not every use of appropriation is a violent and cruel practice, one must be open to see when cultural appropriation can be offensive.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t to say that every single instance is an appropriation and is menacing and is a racist practice,” Blake said. “When is it a question of borrowing and exchange, and when is it a question of theft?”</p>\n<p>After the discussion, the fashion show began, featuring outfits from Afghanistan, Nigeria, Columbia, Palestine, Mexico, West Africa, Vietnam and Kazakhstan.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68552\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68552\" data-attachment-id=\"68552\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/faculty-panel-discusses-cultural-appropriation/cultural-appropriation-panel-_by-effie-sklavenitis-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Cultural Appropriation Panel _by Effie Sklavenitis-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-68552\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Effie Sklavenitis / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68552\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Effie Sklavenitis / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>MCC Programmer Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said she was grateful individuals could use this event to showcase their individual cultures and heritage.</p>\n<p>“We are so grateful for our incredible models … who are representing their own cultures, heritages, ethnicities and identities,” Mohsenian-Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Amanda Becerra and participant in the fashion show said she was proud of her Columbian culture but finds it hard to find other students at UCSB who share the same culture.</p>\n<p>“I grew up with Columbian culture.
