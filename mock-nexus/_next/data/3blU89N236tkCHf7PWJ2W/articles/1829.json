The group, created in the fall of 2015, offers a variety of different gaming platforms for UCSB students from the amateur to competitive level. Gaucho Gaming has 942 members on its Discord server, which the group uses to promote and organize events.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At school, we also have in-person events, so that definitely brings people together and we just all have a common interest,” Annie Huang, a second-year statistics and linguistics double major and the co-president of Gaucho Gaming, said. “So now, we have only online communication and activities.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While clubs have faced difficulties staying together as a result of having their members strewn across the country and isolated at home, Gaucho Gaming is uniquely positioned to make the leap from in-person social events to online-only communication. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since gaming is, obviously, an online thing, it’s been a way to keep in touch with friends, and keeps me connected ” Huang said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a joke, that we’re helping save the world by staying inside and gaming,” Huang added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Normally, the club hosts “re</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gular meetings, fun socials, competitive events, and a huge LAN event every quarter,” a local area network that interconnects computers within physical spaces like room or arena, according to its website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Discord server allows members to make friends and find gaming buddies, as well as “more serious stuff” like opportunities for jobs within the gaming field, Huang said, which has also continued during spring quarter. This Saturday, Gaucho Gaming and UCSB Esports will host a panel in the Discord called “Career in Esports,” with industry professionals from Team Liquid.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, the club has worked to expand its professional network with the help of Francisco Rodriguez, a fourth-year global studies and economics major and the club’s esports outreach officer, who organizes panels and helps gamers understand career paths within the gaming industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the group had a “rocky start” with participation at the start of the online quarter, according to Huang, the cancellation of in-person socializing events forced them to get creative. And with computer-savvy students at the helm, Huang said she has been pleased with recent event participation, despite the challenges they’ve faced. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On May 16, Gaucho Gaming hosted its first-ever Game-A-Thon, sponsored by the gaming gear company Logitech G, where players participated in popular video games League of Legends and Valorant for prizes including Logitech G computer mice, gift cards and game credits, according to their Facebook page. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Game-A-Thon, which was meant to serve as a replacement for the group’s popular LAN event, saw about 200 participants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaucho Gaming has also hosted other events this quarter, like weekly game play, giveaways, and watch parties, according to their Facebook page. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For weekly play, we let our members know what servers we will be on, and what time, and then sort of host spaces for UCSB students to play,” Rodriguez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The club is also reaching out to neighboring schools like UC Los Angeles and Cal Poly to host interconnected events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Doing these things online might give us the opportunity to meet up in person,” Huang said. “That’s definitely something to consider.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group also organizes teams for specific video games; tryouts for UCSB’s League of Legends A and B competition teams recently took place. The event invited all UCSB students to try out, including incoming freshmen and transfers, according to the group’s social media.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huang emphasized how video games and the collaboration that Gaucho Gaming provides gives students the opportunity to connect and socialize during what can be a lonely isolation. Although video games sometimes get a negative reputation as an isolating activity, she explained, they can also be a force for good. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Being indoors more often has brought our online community together.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

For spring quarter, the team upgraded GauchoSpace’s capacity for connections to help the site function with heavy traffic, according to Gus Wood, instructional applications operational expert for GauchoSpace Development and Support.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“GauchoSpace wasn’t designed and set up for quite this environment right out the box, so we’ve kind of been looking at analytics of use and then applying changes to the system configuration as we go,” Wood said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a user has an issue with GauchoSpace, they can either submit a </span><a href=\"https://help.lsit.ucsb.edu/hc/en-us/requests/new\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ticket</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the support team explaining the issue or attend the Monday to Friday, 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. drop-in College of Letters and Science IT hours over Zoom. The team works remotely now, but Wood considered the transition “fairly seamless.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, Wood’s team spends “more time than usual” helping instructors — who’ve never used GauchoSpace in any significant capacity — navigate the platform and tailor their classes to an online curriculum. Wood added that his team needed to help many instructors set up and use the testing options on GauchoSpace. Not all instructors use GauchoSpace to conduct exams, but there have been disputes between university members and proctoring services, such as </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-16/ucsb-faculty-association-issues-letter-advising-against-the-use-of-proctoru-testing-services/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ProctorU</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, about privacy concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Testing administered through GauchoSpace is by far the biggest use of data on the platform, especially due to remote learning, according to Diane Soini, GauchoSpace’s learning management system programmer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you have 800 people and the quiz closes all at once for all of them, all of a sudden, several systems have to calculate everybody’s grade and submit all of their submissions,” Soini said. “It’s a pretty big hit to the system.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GauchoSpace Development and Support team can monitor exams with tight deadlines in real time in order to respond quickly to issues that could occur during the testing period, according to Soini.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wood manages seven graduate student instructional design assistants who help the website perform various tasks, with the bulk of their work spent helping professors and teaching assistants successfully utilize the platform. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With midterms in full swing, the challenge of adapting tests and quizzes to an online platform  while maintaining the tests’ rigor and difficulty level has kept the design assistants busy answering questions and concerns from instructors. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can provide advice on what question types to use, and depending on how instructors would prefer to grade their midterms, what settings to use and we address a lot of concerns about cheating,” Erica Johnson, an instructional design assistant, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although cheating remains an issue for some professors, Johnson said the opportunity to cheat is unlikely to disappear.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t say that there’s a way to completely prevent cheating and sharing of answers, but there are some measures that we can take in the online tools that we use to minimize that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson added that essay-style questions, randomizing the order of questions and answers and time limits are all effective tools for preventing cheating over GauchoSpace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another instructional design assistant, Jonathan Downey, added that the graduate students were generally working more hours now, with most of the graduate students working on average 20 hours a week </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">double the hours of last quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of grad students will be TAs and whatnot, this is kind of what I do in lieu of that,” Downey said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GauchoSpace, which was built on an open-source platform called Moodle, allows the support team to share tips with other universities about how they’ve learned to adapt GauchoSpace using Moodle under the new circumstances. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Utilising Moodle’s open-source software, programmers across different universities can share how they’ve solved bugs and shortened the time a support team needs to troubleshoot, according to Hector Gonzalez, GauchoSpace’s instructional applications programmer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While UCSB announced Tuesday that all </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/all-summer-sessions-to-be-conducted-remotely-university-announces/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">summer sessions </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">would be carried out through remote instruction, the fate of in-person classes for fall quarter remains uncertain. Until the university makes its decision, the GauchoSpace team will need to keep up its increased support level.  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re definitely going to need to maintain that elevated level of support,” Wood said. “I would say that’s what we’re anticipating.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94319\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/gauchospace-sees-increased-visits-new-challenges-amid-remote-instruction-transition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94319\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/gauchospace-sees-increased-visits-new-challenges-amid-remote-instruction-transition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/gauchospace-sees-increased-visits-new-challenges-amid-remote-instruction-transition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/gauchospace-sees-increased-visits-new-challenges-amid-remote-instruction-transition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-05/gauchospace-sees-increased-visits-new-challenges-amid-remote-instruction-transition/","id":1826,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[1825,1824,1823],"comments":[{"id":"ed41853a-c670-4b77-b404-4d428a2eb3a9","name":"Sample User 4","email":"mocknexus@gmail.com","parent":null,"content":"Proin diam magna, aliquam at justo in, pharetra blandit orci.

For Morrison, the biggest losses were the </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-22/university-sheriffs-office-discourage-deltopia-celebrations-in-light-of-coronavirus-crisis/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">now-postponed Warm-Up</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and Extravaganza concerts held annually during spring quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the Program Board knew these concerts couldn’t be facilitated during spring quarter, they looked for imaginative solutions, according to Morrison.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At the end of the day, we have to really focus that our base mission is providing entertainment for students, and we can think creatively about how we can do that,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make up for spring quarter shows and events that had been pushed back or cancelled, Morrison said ASPB decided to invite high-profile speakers for Zoom events.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process proved to be hectic, Morrison said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We kind of just got thrown into this and started having to plan events really fast, versus [having] the previous quarter to plan these events,” Morrison said. “We were planning these events as they were happening.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But despite having to move quickly, securing the talent was relatively straightforward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These are all speakers that I would say that we couldn’t probably bring during the normal year,” Morrison said. But the virtual nature of the events sometimes made convincing the guests simpler — the usual costs and hassles associated with traveling, staffing and paying for a venue would not be necessary, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And because </span><a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/biz/features/hollywood-coronavirus-entertainment-industry-unemployment-jobs-1234592106/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">performers in a frozen entertainment industry</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> no longer have the assurance of steady pay, they have become more flexible with their schedules, according to Morrison. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Their whole livelihood was basically doing events, so I think that now they’re honestly looking for these types of gigs.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The transition to Zoom, however, was not not completely smooth. For the first few gatherings, Morrison recounted one instance of Zoombombing and difficulties ensuring that event attendees were not from outside of UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of the small issues aside, I think it’s been great and I think that people have really come together and worked hard to make these events flow,” Morrison said, adding that all ASPB members have begun to moderate events.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morrison pointed to the Binging with Babish event as one instance of success this quarter, where the titular YouTube personality offered viewers a behind-the-scenes tour of his filming locations — a clandestine opportunity that students wouldn’t have received had the show taken place in person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was our first time doing a big virtual event with an outside talent using this new webinar platform,” Morrison said. “And everyone was just so nice and wonderful and wholesome. It was really sweet.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From that first event, the ASPB has hosted events ranging from a talk with comedian Eric Andre to a </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-10/lil-paint-y-with-lil-yachty/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">night of painting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with rapper Lil Yachty, complete with a question-and-answer session.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When UCSB eventually transitions back to on-campus instruction, the ASPB will likely dial back the frequency of high-profile visits, Morrison said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s wanting to use students’ fees in the best way possible,” she said. “It would be harder to bring in the talent that we are bringing — we’re able to do this because of this kind of new situation and because the costs of it are a lot different.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But when UCSB switches back to on-campus learning, Morrison said that the ASPB won’t forget the difficulties they overcame.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One thing I think [the pandemic] taught us: to be really appreciative of this opportunity that we have on board to book events for students,” Morrison said. “I don’t think we realized until it was gone just how much we love doing this.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But how you can deal with setbacks like this, issues like this — if you can figure out a way through it, you can make great things happen,” she added.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Science. The workshops were also recorded so professors could access them later on the </span><a href=\"https://keepteaching.id.ucsb.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instructional Continuity site.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Adler-Kassner, UCSB’s history of teaching through natural disasters and crises turned out to be helpful in responding to the coronavirus pandemic.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had a pretty good infrastructure to support this partly because of the Thomas Fire,” Adler-Kassner said. “We already had the Instructional Continuity site set up, and because we know Summer Sessions A and B and all the sessions in between will be offered remotely, we’re developing more resources.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Instructional Support Team also holds regular online “coffee hours” over Zoom for instructors and teaching assistants to talk about their remote instruction experiences. If a staff member needs assistance outside of these meetings, the support team is readily available for consultation, Adler-Kassner said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we think toward fall and wait for the campus to provide some guidance about what’s going to happen, we’ll of course be there to support that in very proactive ways,” Adler-Kassner added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from teaching support, the UCSB Academic &amp; Staff Assistance Program (ASAP) is  providing mental and emotional health support for faculty. The group, which offers short-term counseling, consultations, workshops and more, is assisting professors in identifying and managing work-related and personal concerns; these resources are available on </span><a href=\"https://www.hr.ucsb.edu/asap\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the ASAP website.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ASAP also organized the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 Pandemic Coping Skills Resource Group, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which holds group meetings for staff to connect with each other, discuss and learn coping skills and maintain their psychological well-being under stressful circumstances, as described in an email sent out to faculty by the Pati Montojo, the ASAP manager and a licensed psychologist. The group has also started a </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGmApjVWytiKQksNDjoZw8g/featured\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YouTube channel</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, uploading videos that help viewers understand anxieties related to the pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall, who supervises academic planning and programming at UCSB, described the shift to remote learning as a “miraculous transformation,” praising the faculty and staff for their dedication to making the online environment possible in just a few weeks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If somebody had asked us a year ago and said, ‘We want you to transform your whole curriculum to remote teaching, and we’re going to give you a year to do it,’ people would’ve said, ‘Are you crazy?’” Marshall said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Marshall, while instruction for Fall Quarter 2020 remains uncertain, the university hopes to welcome students back to campus for future quarters. However, campus life will likely </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-10/hybrid-course-schedules-single-dorms-face-masks-for-all-preparing-for-fall-quarter-2020-at-ucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not resume to norma</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">l by fall, and UCSB is prepared to continue remote instruction if that is the case.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Until there’s a vaccine, we’re going to be living in somewhat altered circumstances,” Marshall explained. He described a mixed approach to instruction involving a combination between online and in-person classes to reduce density and encourage social distancing. “Whatever arrangement we can make to have it be safe and effective,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, many </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-24/pandemic-pedagogy-faculty-prepares-for-first-quarter-of-remote-instruction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">professors would rather teach face-to-face</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> classes, but as more resources develop, their classes are slowly becoming accustomed to online formats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a lot of innovative teachers. They’ve also gotten help from their students who I think, in many cases, are more conversant, more comfortable, with technology,” Marshall said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adler-Kassner added that as both professors and students adapt to the situation, they’re helping each other create an efficient space for both sides of the screen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s helpful for students when they know we faculty are doing the best that we can and trying to sort of think about things,” Adler-Kassner said. “It’s also helpful for faculty to really hear about the student experience.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are things that we are learning from this experience that can improve our teaching overall.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94450\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-16/a-spectrum-of-support-how-ucsb-is-helping-instructors-teach-through-a-pandemic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94450\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-16/a-spectrum-of-support-how-ucsb-is-helping-instructors-teach-through-a-pandemic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-16/a-spectrum-of-support-how-ucsb-is-helping-instructors-teach-through-a-pandemic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-16/a-spectrum-of-support-how-ucsb-is-helping-instructors-teach-through-a-pandemic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-16/a-spectrum-of-support-how-ucsb-is-helping-instructors-teach-through-a-pandemic/","id":1827,"author":{"id":279,"name":"Melea Maglalang"},"related":[1826,1825,1824],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
