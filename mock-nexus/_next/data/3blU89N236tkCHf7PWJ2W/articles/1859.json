Students who qualify for the program are promised an estimated $120,000 in financial aid over four years if they remain Cal Grant or Pell Grant eligible. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose said that the goal of the stations is to provide students who are hungry with a quick snack during the middle of their days, with options such as granola bars, trail mix, fig bars and fruit snacks, and to supply menstrual products.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the frustrations that motivated this project was that in order to get into the dining commons and access the [A.S.] Food Bank, you need to have a student ID, and our [Promise Scholar] kids often lose their IDs so $35 is a lot of money to replace it,” Roose said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stations have been placed in 10 locations on campus, including the Transfer Student Center, Opening New Doors to Accelerating Success Student Center, UCSB Student Health, the MultiCultural Center, the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, El Centro, College of Letters and Sciences Advising in Cheadle Hall, the Athletics Department, the Educational Opportunity Program and the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose explained that the new project was funded by the California government, which allocated around $80,000. The grant is designated to be spent by June and will be a contender for renewal if the project succeeds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For students with a heavy academic workload, sitting down for a meal during the day is not always feasible. Fifth-year biochemistry and molecular biology major and Promise Scholar Sami Kaayal said the conveniently placed snacks have helped him stay fueled during busy days. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Having a decent chunk of those snacks throughout the week can help me whether I’m rushing to class and I don’t have time to eat breakfast … or just as supplemental snacks throughout the day between classes,” Kaayal said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the Promise Scholars Program represents low-income students, Roose explained that the healthy snacks and menstrual products are available to all students on campus, regardless of income. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Promise Scholars Program deals with very low-income students, but the middle-class students fall through the cracks on this campus as well,” Roose said. “They don’t get financial aid but they can’t necessarily pay for college either so some of the middle-class students are even needier sometimes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At the end of the day, I just want hungry students to get food and proper sanitary products.”</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aniket Mehrotra</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> contributed reporting. </span></em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article

season.</p>\n<p>No, that was not a typo. For the first time in my recent memory, following the Padres acquisition of All-Star first baseman Eric Hosmer, I am legitimately, unequivocally excited for the season to start.</p>\n<p>I can’t remember the last time I felt like this. Going into the 2015 season, I had a tempered form of excitement, but it was more the excitement you feel when you get the new iPhone you wanted three years prior, only to find out that they’ve made about 15 new models in the meantime.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I was pumped to finally have people with name recognition on the team, but I wouldn’t really call a well-past-his-prime Matt Kemp, an ever-inconsistent Justin Upton and a James Shields that had more mileage on his arm than my ‘03 Highlander a reason for true, genuine excitement.</p>\n<p>Even before that, when the Padres were perennial NL West champions, I didn’t feel this energy, this searing excitement at the sheer thought of baseball season.</p>\n<p>Those teams were solid, don’t get me wrong. With Jake Peavy at the front of our rotation and newly-minted hall-of-famer Trevor Hoffman at the back end, our dependable pitching always kept us in games. But despite all of their success, there was never a feeling we were truly competing for a title.</p>\n<p>In reality, we were lucky when we didn’t get swept in the first round of the playoffs – a yearly occurrence for a team that lacked any semblance of a threatening lineup.</p>\n<p>But when I got that notification on my phone in bold letters, “Hosmer decides to sign with Padres,” everything changed.</p>\n<p>San Diego has never, in my entire lifetime, signed an all-star in the midst of his prime – that is, until now. Hosmer is only 28 and is coming off a career season in which he hit .318 with 25 homers at the plate.</p>\n<p>Two seasons ago, this man was named the All-Star Game MVP at Petco Park, proving that perhaps he can overcome the mental mistakes of hitters in the past and actually have success hitting at Petco. As a lefty, those odds are even more likely.</p>\n<p>The city needed this. It was about a year ago that Dean Spanos screwed over an entire city of loyal fans by moving the Chargers.</p>\n<p>San Diego State Basketball hasn’t been up to par since Steve Fisher retired – even before that, if we’re being honest.</p>\n<p>We need a team to get behind, to energize the fan base, to get “America’s Finest City” excited about something again.</p>\n<p>I’m not quixotic enough to really believe that signing Hosmer will automatically catapult us into the title conversation; in fact, I’m not even sure it makes us a playoff team this year. Putting Hosmer at first pushes Wil Myers to the outfield, a position that he once said he “gets bored playing.” Myers gladly signed on to the move, but by no means is he a Gold Glover out there.<br>\nIn addition, our rotation is still a mess, to put it mildly.</p>\n<p>Half of our rotation is probably closer to being in a retirement home than an adequate major league starter. I mean, Chris Young was a good starter for the Padres … in 2006. If Kemp was the old iPhone model, then Young is an iPod Touch Generation Two. With that being said, it supports my notion that the Padres lack an ideal major league rotation.</p>\n<p>Pundits have been all too kind in pointing this out, questioning the fit and the Padres decision to dole out over $140 million to a player who has been inconsistent at times throughout his career.</p>\n<p>But Hosmer has two things that his stats can’t account for: leadership and experience.</p>\n<p>He’s been to the World Series with the Royals. According to Ken Rosenthal, reviews have been “glowing” on Hosmer’s clubhouse presence. He can provide invaluable insight for a young rebuilding roster that boasts one of the best farm systems in the majors.</p>\n<p>And because of his age, he still fits in the Padres’ long-term plans. The goal the entire time was to “compete” in 2019; at that point, Hosmer will still only be 29.</p>\n<p>Plus, the deal is front-loaded to allow the Padres to get rid of him after five years with a much lesser salary hit.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, we have a reason to celebrate, to see the clear vision of the front office and to applaud them for finally being willing to spend money. We have a reason to cheer again.</p>\n<p>Just like every year in the recent past, I’ll be attending opening day with my dad. This time, however, I will do so with renewed hope. This time, I will do so with the belief that we are on the cusp of finally bringing a title back to the city I hold so dear.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Feb. 22</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

Along the way, we will explore Israeli society, Palestinian society, and the conflict in the region,” the application for the trip reads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the application page, the Santa Barbara Hillel, which is located in Isla Vista, says students will, among other things, “[hear] multiple narratives from a wide variety of speakers and guests, including religious, secular, Druze, Christian, Jewish-Israeli, Palestinian, and Muslim voices.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition lays out several reasons why Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) is opposed to the trip, building upon a statement it released </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/UCSBSJP/photos/a.531496596893112/2383080478401372/?type=3&amp;theater\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">last spring</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that called upon student leadership to “refrain from attending the Perspectives Israel Trip.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We oppose this trip on the basis of morally deficient funding sources, normalization of the occupation of Palestine, and its ultimate goal of silencing calls for Palestinian freedom,” the organization wrote in this year’s petition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SJP argues in the petition that any Associated Students (A.S.) senators who attended a Perspectives trip would have a conflict of interest if a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/a-s-senate-votes-against-divestment-through-secret-ballot/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“divestment resolution”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> were to be reintroduced this year.

Legal Code as “situations of personal financial gain (A1), situations wherein votes are cast to benefit friends and family (A2), and situations where the interests of AS senators’ outside organizational involvements conflict with the interests of ASUCSB (A3).”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said in a follow-up interview that while the Perspectives trips were mostly covered by the Santa Barbara Hillel, they did not count, in his interpretation of Legal Code, as a “financial gain,” since attendees did not actually receive any financial compensation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barth, in addition to a number of current and former elected members of A.S., went on the Perspectives trip this past summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I decided to go on this educational trip, I was seeking to enhance my knowledge of international issues through first-hand experience. If I thought it was a conflict of interest and would inhibit my ability to judge fairly and impartially as Attorney General the following year, I would not have gone,” Barth said in a message when asked if he believed his own attendance on the trip created a conflict of interest in determining if attending the trip created a conflict of interest for senators.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I maintain that, using the definition of conflict of interest in AS Legal Code that governs my position, Perspectives is not a conflict of interest for elected officials who have gone or intend to go on it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition also argues that the application for the trip “implicitly states” that the trip will be unbiased but does not actually provide students with “a diversity of perspectives” because the trip is funded by Maccabee Task Force (MTF); MTF advertises itself on its website as an organization created “to combat the disturbing spread of anti-Semitism on America’s college campuses.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe the BDS movement is at the forefront of this troubling trend. We maintain that BDS is an anti-Semitic movement that crosses the line from legitimate criticism of Israel into the dangerous demonization of Israel and its supporters,” MTF continues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement is “a Palestinian-led movement for freedom, justice and equality,” according to the </span><a href=\"https://bdsmovement.net/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">movement’s website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and “aims to end international support for Israeli violations of international law by forcing companies, institutions and governments to change their policies.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition argues that MTF’s stance “demonstrate[s] [MTF’s] closed mindedness regarding the occupation, given its obvious and vehement opposition to the Palestinian call for</span><a href=\"https://bdsmovement.net/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against Israel (BDS).” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SJP also condemns the fact that Sheldon Adelson — one of the </span><a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/trump-inc-podcast/sheldon-adelson-casino-magnate-trump-macau-and-japan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">biggest funders</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and a “</span><a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/2018/10/22/sheldon-adelson-breaks-spending-record-on-midterm-elections-surpassing-100m/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">conservative megadonor</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” — serves as president of MTF. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Furthermore, the reign of terror that Donald Trump and Republican Congresspeople have exacted on marginalized communities within the United States and across the globe, combined with the continued occupation of Palestine galvanized by far-right political figures in Israel, has been extensively funded by Adelson much like MTF’s Perspectives Trips,” the petition wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition also notes that the Santa Barbara Hillel received $238,739 from MTF in 2016 for “Campus Education and Trip to Israel” — the largest donation to a college campus listed on the </span><a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/474908810/201702979349300200/full\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maccabee Task Force’s 2016 tax returns</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — and an additional $119,807 in </span><a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/474908810/201842699349301204/full\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2017</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There was no donation purpose listed on the 2017 returns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This demonstrates the immense commitment from outside billionaires to engage in “pro-Israel” lobbying on students, specifically at the UCSB campus,” the petition wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goodman, the executive director of Santa Barbara Hillel, said the organization receives funding from people with a wide variety of political views, but that a funder’s political leanings do not affect the kind of programming the center puts on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It happens, that in this case, we have a funder who we’re transparent about. If students ask, we will tell them where the particular funding from portions of this comes from,” Goodman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our organization has a budget that is close to a million dollars; there’s no student who would be happy with the politics of every single one of those donors,” he added. “We have conservative students as well, who might not be happy with some of our progressive donors’ political leanings. But that doesn’t mean that we don’t use those funds to help put on Shabbat dinners on Friday night.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goodman also said he is personally responsible for putting together the itinerary for the Perspectives trip. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That doesn’t mean that my own personal politics need to align with a lead donor on this project to make it a successful project,” Goodman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Goodman said Hillel does not claim that the trip will be unbiased. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I make it very clear, it’s not unbiased. We’re gonna show them lots of biases, we’re gonna show them a wide variety of different perspectives, and they’re not gonna agree with all of them,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The idea that college students would come to college in order to advocate boycotts, and then advocate boycotts of things that could help you to learn more about the situation at hand or meet other people is patently absurd,” Goodman added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to opposing the trip due to its funding sources, SJP wrote in the petition that they are calling for a boycott of the trip because they believed the trip contributes to the “normalization of the occupation of Palestine, and its ultimate goal of silencing calls for Palestinian freedom.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SJP representatives Dylan Kupsh and Ivana Cruz said in an interview that they felt the need to circulate this petition because they believed “outside lobbyists” should not be influencing campus politics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope people understand the real gravity at stake at UCSB and how much people are lobbying,” Kupsh said. “I would be outraged as a student to know that an outside person is influencing student politics more than students themselves or student orgs.”  </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
