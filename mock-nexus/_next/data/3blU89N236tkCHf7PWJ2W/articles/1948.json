The team was all smiles in the locker room until they heard the news of the tragic events that took place in I.V. that evening.</p>\n<p>“We were on the road when that happened, at Davis, actually, and we reached out to the guys not on the travel squad to make sure they were okay,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said.</p>\n<p>Despite the shooting, UCSB still had to play a game against UC Davis on Saturday, the final game of the three-game set. For better or for worse, Santa Barbara took the field with heavy hearts and mustered a 6-3 victory to secure a sweep of the Aggies.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When the Gauchos finally came home after their win on Saturday, they didn’t come home to the same place they had left just a few days ago. The once lively campus was instead filled with sorrow and pain.</p>\n<p>Instead of being able to celebrate a sweep of UC Davis and possibly a chance at making the postseason, many of the players had to learn quickly the horrors of what had happened.</p>\n<p>Walking off the pitch after a final win of the season on Tuesday defeating USC 11-2, the UCSB men’s baseball found itself in the same place it had been three years ago.</p>\n<p>Moments before the game, the team held a moment of silence to remember the tragedy that befell UCSB. Whether it was a player, coach or someone who worked with UCSB athletics, the tragedy made them realize that changes were necessary for their own lives and beyond.</p>\n<p>“Because baseball allows these kids to have their own culture, they had a healthy distraction and each other, really, to help them cope with this,” Checketts said.</p>\n<p>One of the people who did not travel with the team three years ago was Sports Information Director Andrew Wagner. An S.I.D.’s job requires them to write previews and recaps of the teams they cover while releasing any breaking news about the team in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p>Wagner still serves as the S.I.D. of multiple sports, including the baseball team that he was covering at the time.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t travel with the team on that long trip, and despite having graduated a couple years back, I still lived in Isla Vista,” Wagner said. “So I was in town when this happened; I actually lived about 100 feet from the 7-Eleven where part of the shooting happened, and I just remember all the texts and calls asking if I was okay. It almost just didn’t feel real. This isn’t supposed to happen here, but it did.”</p>\n<p>Despite not being a student anymore, the event stuck around in Wagner’s mind.</p>\n<p>“It was just a night-and-day type of experience after the shooting,” Wagner said. “For a while after that, everybody just felt numb; it was weird. You just don’t imagine something like that happening in California,” Wagner said, “much less Santa Barbara and much less at UCSB where everything is more carefree, relaxed and happy.</p>\n<p>Andrew made note of the fact that this shooting was a sort of wake-up call for him, and he, like many others, tried to cope with the horrific incident that took UCSB by storm.</p>\n<p>“One of the craziest experiences I’ve had was the vigil at Harder Stadium, where both sides of the stands were packed tight but there was no noise. Everybody was so sad and in a state of disbelief,” Wagner said. “That vigil really hit close to home in multiple ways because, for a while, UCSB became known for partying and the shooting, and it made me so sad because this is such a great university and that’s not always the reputation it gets.”</p>\n<p>For Checketts in particular, a man with children of his own, this tragedy brought forth the memory of another shooting that made him re-evaluate.</p>\n<p>Checketts said. “When Sandy Hook happened, it opened my eyes. Having young kids and looking at those little faces made me sad and angry. Looking at this from our community standpoint, it was obviously scary. Isla Vista is my community. I live just around the corner. When it happens so close to home, it sure makes it a lot more real. Unfortunately, from a country standpoint, it happens so often and at such a high rate relative to other developed countries, it gets frustrating.”</p>\n<p>Since this shooting, Checketts has been involved in trying to find solutions to the current gun issue the United States faces.</p>\n<p>“There were victims in the Isla Vista tragedy that weren’t caused by gunfire and I recognize that, but as a 40-year-old man with young kids, this tragedy has motivated me to look more closely at how we handle our guns in this country. In California, we have seen some progress on this issue with some recent legislation, but more needs to be done…Families shouldn’t have to go through this kind of pain as regularly as they do in our country.”</p>\n<p>Three years later, the pain the community once felt has subsided, but it still lingers around this time. UCSB defeating USC on Tuesday wasn’t the Yankees winning the World Series after 9/11 or the Saints winning a Super Bowl after Katrina, but it was a sign that life does, in fact, go on. You can try to improve the problems we face every day, and there is beauty in that.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we can completely stop bad things from happening across our country, but we have other developed countries with a fraction of the gun violence that we have and should be looking at their models and potential solutions to reduce our risk of gun violence. The tragedy in Isla Vista is another unfortunate reminder that we aren’t immune to gun violence, even in paradise.” Checketts said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

American Indian Student Association (AISA) EOP peer mentor Jeike Meijer, a fourth-year global studies and feminist studies double major, worked with another peer mentor to plan the celebration. Meijer served as the Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs for the 2018-2019 school year and was the first Native American to serve as an Associated Students executive at UCSB — a focal point of her campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Through 500 years of colonialism and a tribal genocide, my people are supposed to be gone, but I’m still here, so [Indigenous Peoples’ Day] stands to me as resilience and I remember my ancestors, my family and how much they fought so that I can be here,” Meijer explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One major focus of the celebration was the resilience of the native and indigenous communities, which attendees touched on by sharing stories from their personal histories. Allison Dutra, a second-year zoology major who attended the event, found the emphasis on family origins particularly impactful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it was really cool how [attendees] touched on their roots, the efforts that they’re putting in today to help kind of restore [what] once was here,” Dutra said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One attendee used their time to speak out against Chancellor Henry Yang’s involvement with the Thirty Meter Telescope Project, currently in construction on Mauna Kea on the big island of Hawaii – a sacred ground for native Hawaiians. Yang currently serves as the chair of the telescope’s board of governors; his role sparked backlash from UCSB students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other AISA members touched on the importance of UCSB students being aware of the past Chumash roots of the campus. Linda Murray, an alumna who was involved with AISA during her time at UCSB, believes that UCSB students have a responsibility to honor the Chumash. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We respect [the Chumash] and their culture and know that they’re still here. Natives are not in the past tense — we’re alive and nationally have networks,” Murray said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer echoed this sentiment, acknowledging that the role of academia on campus translates to a heightened responsibility to learn about the realities of indigenous history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“By recognizing Indigenous Peoples’ Day, we’re taking in knowledge, we’re learning and hopefully providing [information] for future generations to say that Columbus Day isn’t okay anymore,” Meijer explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, the I.V. Community Services District began acknowledging the Chumash people’s roots to I.V. at the beginning of each meeting with a statement meant to “pay our respects to the Chumash elders, past, present  and future, who call this place, Anisq’Oyo, the land that Isla Vista sits upon, their home.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To many in attendance, an important part of the celebration was to recognize the historical inaccuracies in regards to indigenous people, to correct this history and to understand their right to occupy spaces on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The history [needs to] be written correctly for students to know before they get to the university,” Murray said. “It’s really important for us to exchange with each other and to feel that we also belong here when we are actually the original descendants.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

addition of two new programs, UC San Diego and Cal State Bakersfield, to the league, which is now up to 11 total teams.</p>\n<p>While this is good news for both universities and the commissioner of the Big West, Dennis Farrell, there is a question of how this will affect UCSB.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, this was a huge move for UCSD.

Currently, apart of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), CSUB has to travel a lot to face their conference opponents such as schools like New Mexico State, Seattle University, Chicago State, Utah Valley and more that were just out of their way.</p>\n<p>Nine of the teams in the Big West Conference are all in the same state, California, which will help them save money on travel costs.</p>\n<p>Since it is already a D-I program, CSUB will become an official Big West member in all sports in 2020.</p>\n<p>UCSD and CSUB will probably find a very happy life in the Big West just as UC Davis did when it joined back in 2003.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79939\" style=\"width: 291px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1821621230\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79937\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79939\" data-attachment-id=\"79939\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/how-do-the-latest-big-west-changes-impact-ucsb/bigwestmap/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap.png?fit=600%2C1700&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,1700\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"bigwestmap\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap.png?fit=88%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap.png?fit=361%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-79939\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap-361x1024.png?resize=281%2C797\" alt=\"\" width=\"281\" height=\"797\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap.png?resize=361%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 361w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap.png?resize=88%2C250&amp;ssl=1 88w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bigwestmap.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79939\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>However, the bigger question is how will this affect UCSB and the sports programs found here on campus?</p>\n<p>The short answer: This is not a move that will help UCSB in any way.</p>\n<p>While the two schools might be able to help the Gauchos in smaller sports such as men’s water polo or men’s volleyball, they won’t be a big boost to the sports most fans and alums care about: soccer, baseball and basketball.</p>\n<p>CSUB has been improving in men’s basketball, winning the WAC title the last two seasons and making a decent run in the NIT last year, but it’s not a school that the Gauchos will benefit from having on their schedule — not yet.</p>\n<p>If they continue the trend, then maybe down the line this could become a great game that will draw many fans, but as of right now, I doubt UCSB students will be geared up to go to a CSUB game.</p>\n<p>Again, CSUB is not a bad addition that will hurt UCSB due to its winning ways the past few years, but its jump to the Big West will also show if those winning seasons were due to them being in a less competitive conference or not.</p>\n<p>As for UCSD, they will be an RPI anchor for years until they can get their program up to D-I competitiveness. While not being an anchor for the first years during their reclassification period, the Tritons will have a tough time before they get their program to a competitive level.</p>\n<p>For comparison reasons, UC Davis barely won their first Big West Tournament title this past season and while they are in the right direction, before last season they only had one winning campaign in their first 12 years of Division-I status.</p>\n<p>These two additions will also not move the conference up the RPI ladder as a whole either.</p>\n<p>In baseball, the Gauchos are already in a peculiar position in that if they don’t win their conference, then their road to a postseason regional match is already up in the air.</p>\n<p>It comes down to who they schedule and beat in non-conference play because, as it stands, the Big West conference is not seen as deserving of more than one team sent to the postseason.</p>\n<p>It has routinely sent more than one team in the past, but it has not always been easy and in fact, the Gauchos missed the postseason in despite going 34-17-1 because their RPI was not up to snuff.</p>\n<p>Again, CSUB does not help this problem. It also doesn’t help that last year’s conference RPI has the Big West in eighth while the WAC was in 25.</p>\n<p>UCSD has been a big factor in D-II college baseball, but a move to D-I will be a difficult one, and while some teams have managed to build a contender in a short amount of time, it will still be a tough road for the Tritons.</p>\n<p>The same problem goes for other big sports such as soccer.</p>\n<p>The problem with adding CSUB isn’t that you are adding a program that is horrible across the sports landscape, it’s that you’re adding another average team to a conference that could use a big name to help propel its status.</p>\n<p>As it stands right now, the addition of these two teams doesn’t help UCSB. But, if down the line CSUB is able to continue their success in sports such as basketball, baseball, etc. and help renovate some of their stadiums, which it hopes to do with the money it saves, then maybe they could help get some more exposure for a conference primarily now made up of California teams.</p>\n<p>The same goes for UCSD once they become a full-fledged member.</p>\n<p>The bottom line for UCSB, however, is simple: it has to capitalize on this conference and start becoming the team that dominates it, especially in these bigger sports. For most successful mid-majors like Gonzaga in men’s basketball, they aren’t in tough conferences either, however, it’s the way they dominate their conference that gives them notoriety.</p>\n<p>The Big West, even with these two additions, is still a conference that can provide some quality teams. But if UCSB can become the team that dominates in year in and year out, then it won’t matter who is and who is not added.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 30</em><em>, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
