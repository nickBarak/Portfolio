If you really love it, the stepping stones working towards it are just as rewarding as getting to do it and ending up with that as your job.”  — Taylor Swift</p>\n<p>What does Taylor Swift have to do with sports, the Daily Nexus or my time at UCSB? Technically nothing. In fact, on a scale from one to 10, their correlation would probably be a negative two.</p>\n<p>Yet, this quote perfectly describes my four years with this paper and my two years as the Sports Editor because the fact is, most people search for a lifetime to find a job they love. I was lucky enough to discover my passion for sports journalism at 14. I took my love for writing and abnormally large passion for sports and squished them together. It stuck, and I’ve never looked back.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>At UCSB, it’s only continued to grow. These four years have flown by and now, after studying for more hours than I’d like to count, writing hundreds of articles, spending dozens of late nights/new days in the Nexus office and having countless laughs, I formally say goodbye to the school (and that wonderful beach less than 10 minutes from my doorstep) I love so much.</p>\n<p>SB has truly become my home. My time in Santa Barbara and with the Nexus has only been a part of my journey, but what a journey it’s been.</p>\n<p>In my time here with the Nexus, I’ve written the season of our men’s soccer team that at one point was No. 2 in the nation. I wrote the track season in 2012 when we had athletes make it to Olympic Trials. I’ve done a one-on-one interview with three-time Olympic Gold Medalist Kerri Walsh Jennings. I’ve sat courtside in the Honda Center not once, but twice, to watch our women’s basketball team in the Big West Playoffs, including watching the team win the title in 2012. I’ve won a CCMA award for a column I wrote on Title IX. And most recently, this year, I received the opportunity to interview the Sacramento Kings, my hometown team, during training camp here at UCSB.</p>\n<p>My experience with the Nexus has truly exceeded anything I could ever imagine and I am truly honored to have brought you your sports coverage every day.</p>\n<p>So Gauchos, while I’m going to leave the philosophical stuff to my co-editor, I do have two pieces of advice for you all.</p>\n<p>It may be cliché, but find something you love and never let anyone tell you that you can’t or that you’re not good enough. I tell people all the time I would pay others to do my job. It’s one of the best feelings in the world.<br>\nThe second is to enjoy the sports here. No, we’re not a part of the Pac-12 and we don’t have an elite football team, but we have some fantastic teams here on campus. Give them a shot.</p>\n<p>Finally, I have some major thank yous to give out. First, thank you to my friends and family for your support and always reading my articles when I tell you to. Thank you to the athletic department for not only your verbal, but financial support. Thanks to every coach and athlete I’ve ever interviewed. I know I’m just a pain for you guys a lot of the time, but I really do enjoy and appreciate your time. Thank you to the 2011 softball team, my first ever team with the Nexus, for making me fall in love with sports journalism all over again.</p>\n<p>A very special shout out to the women’s basketball teams the last three years. I’ve written every game covered by the Nexus during the Carlene Mitchell era and some of those moments have been my favorite during my time here. Of course, a very big thank you to Coach Mitch. You’re the coach I’ve most gotten to know on campus and I’ve loved every second talking with you and getting to pick your brain about women’s basketball.</p>\n<p>Thanks to my staff, especially my co-editor PMO (we’ve made the best team), for putting up with my perfectionistic ways deep into the night. And most importantly, to the readers — you are the reason we’ve been the No. 9 newspaper the last two years. Keep it up.</p>\n<p>Because I hate goodbyes, I’m simply going to say see you later, UCSB.<br>\nLove,</p>\n<p>Kristen</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55653\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55653\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/","id":2067,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[2066,2065,2064],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"NBA Playoffs First Round Winners and Losers","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/nba-logo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/nba-logo.jpg?resize=500%2C487&ssl=1","description":"Staff writer Michael Jorgenson discusses the biggest successes and failures of the first round of the NBA Playoffs.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>True NBA fans don’t get their yearly fix of basketball heaven during March Madness — they get it in May and June.

But he made it clear from his first moments wearing a Trail Blazers uniform that he was not just another early first-round point guard bust. Lillard took the NBA on in his rookie year <em>à</em><em> </em>la Chris Paul in 2005, taking home Rookie of the Year honors in a landslide. He was fearless, he was very good and just about everyone who saw him knew that he was going to be something special.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to this year, and to say that the Blazers’ future is bright would be a huge understatement. Lillard finished his first ever first-round series with averages of 25-6-6, with all of his main statistical categories making drastic improvements. With LaMarcus Aldridge complementing Lillard’s all-star play, the Blazers were able to take down the fourth-seeded Houston Rockets in six games. The last play we saw from that series will surely be remembered for years to come. With 0.9 seconds left, trailing by two, Lillard caught the ball off a screen, quickly planted his feet and knocked down one of the most cold-blooded threes I have ever seen, sending his team to the next round.</p>\n<p>He’s a guy who plays well beyond his years, and if he keeps progressing at this rate, we’re going to be seeing him hold up an MVP trophy someday, whether it’s in May or June.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Dwight Howard – Looking Bad</b></p>\n<p>Speaking of Lillard’s shot, my favorite moment was actually the one we saw shortly after. The Laker in me will hate the Blazers as a team forever, but it will always love that post-game celebration for one reason: Dwight Howard’s face.</p>\n<p>Dwight was once a top MVP candidate in Orlando and the easy choice for Defensive Player of the Year. He was once considered Superman. But ever since the Dwightmare began, it’s all gone downhill for him. He was out with a back injury for his final days in Orlando, traded to the Lakers, experienced the worst, most embarrassing year in the Kobe Bryant era at the time (and there have been a couple of really bad ones) and ran away from the bright lights to Houston. It didn’t take long for him and the rest of the league to realize that Dwight’s days playing second fiddle to a shooting guard were not over yet.</p>\n<p>This team has been clearly established as James Harden’s team from the second Harden arrived two years ago. Let’s face it though — Dwight’s numbers are still up there. He averaged 26 points and nearly 14 rebounds per game in the first round — it’s just the way he looks on the court. He used to be the closest thing to Shaq we had left. He used to be a dominant force. For the last two years, though, he’s looked like a pushover. His mentality is that of a pushover, and his record of 2-8 in the playoffs since leaving Orlando is something that is surely haunting his already-tarnished reputation right now.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Oklahoma City Thunder – Looking Bad</b></p>\n<p>Losing Game Five at home — no matter how close it was to a win — was not something that these hopeful champs should have let happen. They did what they were supposed to do, winning Game Six in Memphis in a convincing fashion and finishing it off at home in Game Seven, but there are some holes in the Thunder’s armor that the rest of the league is surely aware of.</p>\n<p>The last time Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant were both healthy in the playoffs, they made it to the Finals. However, San Antonio will have no fear playing the young Thunder superstars with home-court advantage and the powers of the anti-aging serum Gregg Popovich has been feeding his team for the last 10 years. That is, if the Spurs even make it to the conference finals, because Chris Paul is hungry for some championship action. Time to shape up, OKC; this is supposed to be your time to shine, not the Clippers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Brooklyn Nets – Looking Good</b></p>\n<p>This is a team that was built for the playoffs. Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce look fresher than they did all season. Deron Williams and Joe Johnson are perennial All-Stars and have plenty of playoff experience themselves. The Nets swept Miami 4-0 in the regular season. Yes, it’s just the regular season, but when it comes to taking down the champs in the playoffs, you need to take every advantage you can get. The Nets have the advantage of confidence and leaders who have beaten LeBron numerous times in the past. Brooklyn-Miami will be a fun series.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Indiana Pacers – Looking Bad</b></p>\n<p>Well, when you talk about OKC going down 3-2 to Memphis, at least you’re talking about a pair of 50-win teams. The Pacers should be embarrassed for going down 3-2 to the Atlanta Hawks, a team that was well below .500 and still managed to make the playoffs in a poorly contested Eastern Conference. They tend to step up their game against Miami, but after barely slipping by Atlanta, this team had better get its act together quickly. Luckily, they have the Wizards in the second round and not the Nets.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Let’s hope for more amazing games in round two!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55153\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/nba-playoffs-first-round-winners-and-losers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55153\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/nba-playoffs-first-round-winners-and-losers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/nba-playoffs-first-round-winners-and-losers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/nba-playoffs-first-round-winners-and-losers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/nba-playoffs-first-round-winners-and-losers/","id":2066,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[2065,2064,2063],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Did Magic Johnson Save the WNBA by Buying the Sparks?","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/lasparks.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/lasparks.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With the Sparks remaining in L.A., the future of the WNBA looks bright","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Other journalists can say the WNBA would have survived without the Los Angeles Sparks, but I tend to think otherwise.</p>\n<p>If the Sparks had folded, the WNBA would’ve been down to 11 teams total with only five in the Western Conference.

Speaking for women’s sports, it’s sad to think a team with that much talent, ranking second in the league in scoring at 81.9 points per game last season, is suffering.</p>\n<p>However, probably most importantly, being that L.A. is one of the biggest sports markets in the country, if the Sparks had folded, it would be hard to justify that the longest lasting women’s professional league in American history deserves to make it.</p>\n<p>Luckily for the WNBA, it no longer has to think about what would have been without the L.A. Sparks, but simply what will be.</p>\n<p>After past owner Paula Madison abruptly announced the team’s folding in December, saying she had lost $12 million, including $1.4 million last season, and didn’t expect to see any change in the upcoming season, the WNBA fought hard to find new owners. It seems the league put everything aside — a new schedule, a date for the WNBA draft, etc. — to ensure the Sparks continued to exist.</p>\n<p>Uncertainty surrounded the franchise for just over a month. While the Golden State Warriors showed great interest in purchasing and relocating the team, one man ensured the team stayed where it belongs.</p>\n<p>Ervin “Magic” Johnson earned his name once again. Teaming up with chairman of the Dodgers, Mark Walter, the pair bought the Sparks exactly one week ago. Johnson, the man known for revitalizing the Lakers in the 80’s and buying a small portion of the bankrupt Dodgers, clearly spearheaded the purchase and is saving an L.A. team once again.</p>\n<p>He called buying the team a “no brainer” as his three sisters and daughter play basketball. Walter has a daughter who plays as well. In a world where women’s basketball is often pushed aside and looked down upon, this is a good sign for the WNBA: a big-name figure believes in women’s basketball just the way it is.</p>\n<p>The WNBA can also take pride in the fact that in approximately a month from the previous owner’s announcement of giving up, the league found new owners in a time of crisis. This is leaps and bounds better than just a few years ago when the WNBA ran the defunct Houston Comets for time but couldn’t find owners, or when the league simply gave up on the Sacramento Monarchs immediately after their folding. Both were also original franchises with championships.</p>\n<p>In fact, up until the news on the Sparks, the WNBA seemed to be making great strides. WNBA Commissioner Laurel Ritchie recently announced that over half the teams in the league last season were profitable with the league being profitable as a whole.</p>\n<p>In addition, the WNBA signed an extension with ESPN, extending coverage of WNBA basketball through 2022. At the end of last season, viewership was up 86 percent on NBA TV and 41 percent on ESPN2. Attendance and merchandise sales had also increased, with the “3 To See” rookies from last season claiming the top spots on the league’s top-selling jersey list. This season, over 80 regular season and playoff games will be televised.</p>\n<p>Finally, national brands such as Jamba Juice, Boost Mobile and Proctor &amp; Gamble have signed on as sponsors, and are shown written across the jerseys of all WNBA teams. This brings in more money, and more and more teams have been getting sponsors than in years past.</p>\n<p>All in all, the future of the WNBA seems to be looking up.</p>\n<p>Would all of this have continued without a team in L.A.? Maybe, maybe not. Thankfully, women’s basketball will never have to know.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of Feb. 12th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53983\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-12/did-magic-johnson-save-the-wnba-by-buying-the-sparks/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53983\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-12/did-magic-johnson-save-the-wnba-by-buying-the-sparks/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-12/did-magic-johnson-save-the-wnba-by-buying-the-sparks/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-12/did-magic-johnson-save-the-wnba-by-buying-the-sparks/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-12/did-magic-johnson-save-the-wnba-by-buying-the-sparks/","id":2064,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[2063,2062,2061],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Term in Review: A.S.

Going in, she believed “people just knew what this office does… but in reality, I found out that besides going to Senate meetings and talking to various orgs, they had no idea what this office was.”</p>\n<p>She said her “biggest success” was kickstarting a plan to get the bike shop a permanent location on campus, a task she has been working on throughout the school year. Approximately $3 million is budgeted for the project so far, she said, noting that the bike shop is something that the majority of campus utilizes.</p>\n<p>Because the project is still in its early stages – Kopel presented the shop’s plans at Wednesday night’s Senate meeting – it will ultimately be up to President-elect Alison Sir to see the project through its entirety.</p>\n<p>In regards to the tuition hike, Kopel said she was “blessed” that the UC Regents listened to the students on lobby trips in that they decided not to raise in-state tuition for the 2018-2019 school year.</p>\n<p>She noted that she herself has gone on two different lobby trips over the past year, one to DC and another to the student lobby conference in Sacramento, lobbying for Pell Grant and Cal Grant expansion.</p>\n<p>Kopel also praised the work the EVPSA office has done <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-08/evpsa-position-will-remain-vacant-until-spring-elections-board-says/\">without an actual EVPSA</a> , highlighting its efforts with Coffee and Calls and on the several lobby trips throughout the year.</p>\n<p>She referenced the latest out-of-state resident tuition hike that was on the UC Regents’s table, noting that her office, in conjunction with the EVPSA office, “mobilized to get people out [there and] make it definitely aware that [the tuition hike] was happening.”</p>\n<p>She also met with UC President Janet Napolitano once a quarter, along with all of the other UC undergraduate student presidents, and said she was proud that during every single meeting, they “addressed tuition hikes and basic needs and college affordability.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve talked about that every single time and made it aware to the [UC] president that the council of presidents won’t stand for anything less than making college more and more affordable.”</p>\n<p>In regards to the natural disaster relief fund, Kopel said she found it difficult to “navigate the administration” and what routes to take when looking for sources of money.</p>\n<p>She explained that during this past year, she rediscovered an A.S. Excellence Fund that had been created by 2013-2014 A.S. President Jonathan Abboud during his time as president. The fund, made up entirely by alumni donations, was meant to be used for “bettering the academic experience of students.”</p>\n<p>The vague description means the fund can be put toward a large variety of uses, Kopel said.</p>\n<p>Currently, the fund has approximately $2,000 in it and has not yet been used. Kopel is currently working on getting more money into the fund so it can help students facing financial crisis from natural disasters in the future.</p>\n<p>“I’m really hoping that by the end of the quarter, we’ll be able to reach that $10,000 mark at the fund, and that at that point it will become an endowment and can start generating its funds,” she said. “Even if I don’t reach that $10,000 goal [by the end of the quarter]… Alison will be able to pick it up really easily next year.”</p>\n<p>In regards to helping sexual assault suvivors, Kopel referenced her work with Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), stating that she did “a lot of work with them” in Fall Quarter 2018 by helping with the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/sasa-releases-list-of-asks-plans-to-approach-ucsb-administration/\">Asks</a> they put together.</p>\n<p>Aside from tangible projects, Kopel said she believed her role throughout the past year on this campus was to be visible, to help connect marginalized communities and those advocating on campus “with the people that they really need to get their efforts seen [by].”</p>\n<p>“When it comes to supporting communities and specifically the survivor community, there’s already so much work that’s going on that I don’t want to co-op or take credit for or change [what they’re doing] because they’re so strong.”</p>\n<p>Kopel said that as the first woman president in four years – with James Villarreal in 2015-2016, Austin Hechler in 2016-2017 and Hieu Le in 2017-2018 – she felt it was a “responsibility of mine” to do whatever she could to “be supportive and [be] there for survivors and for women.”</p>\n<p>She noted that she was proud of helping set up the Hate and Bias On Campus town hall.</p>\n<p>She further denounced Betsy DeVos’s proposed Title IX changes, stating there has to be “ample protections in place for survivors on UC campuses.”</p>\n<p>One of Kopel’s other platform points, one she referenced during her candidate forum, was “uniting the campus.” In that, Kopel said “uniting the campus,” for her, means “standing up for people who are unseen by this campus or underrepresented, or never heard enough.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve written letters for, spoke up for, gone to meeting with, spoken on a system wide level to the [UC] president [for underrepresented communities],” she said.</p>\n<p>“[I’ve gone] out to strikes, whether it be for AFSCMEor the Pan Asian Network, using my platform to uplift those voices that aren’t heard enough is a way to show as many people on campus as possible that these communities are in need, that these communities need support more than they’re getting.”</p>\n<p><strong>Nonpartisanship: </strong></p>\n<p>She praised the 69th Senate’s success in terms of the bills and resolutions passed; according to Kopel, this year’s Senate put out a “record number” of resolutions and bills, particularly in putting out resolutions that support “various communities” on campus.</p>\n<p>“I think Senate has definitely made it one of their priorities to make sure that they’re standing up for these students… I think there’s a few shining stars in Senate that have made work their priorities, but there’s a lot of others that kind of have been hidden under the brush.”</p>\n<p>But she noted the contentious situation that this year’s Senate brought: “Not only does it feel kind of tense and the air is really thick in there, but you can visually see a divide. You can tell who’s been elected by Campus United and you can tell who’s been elected from the Isla Vista Party.”</p>\n<p>Kopel attributed that fault and toxicity to both parties.</p>\n<p>“Partisanship and toxicity and harmful words and attacks get in the way of work we’re supposed to be doing.”</p>\n<p>Kopel was also tasked during her presidency with <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-30/vacant-judicial-council-seats-filled-nine-weeks-after-quarter-begins/\">filling four vacant Judicial Council seats</a> – an unprecedented situation in recent UCSB student government history, and one that caused “uproar” within the Senate as Kopel presented her chosen appointments.</p>\n<p>“I was heavily affiliated with Campus United [at the time] and the Senate was split [on Judicial Council appointments], 50-50,” Kopel said, referencing the Judicial Council cases on the table at the time regarding her former party.</p>\n<p>“I think at first [the process] was hostile, but I think I did a very good job in being level-headed and open-minded and very open to their suggestions.”</p>\n<p>Kopel also noted that this past election season was more “hostile” than her year’s election had been, stating it was “really disheartening for me,” referencing, in her words, the “anti-Black” and “transphobic” comments made toward former A.S. presidential candidate Zion Solomon on a UCSB Reddit thread.</p>\n<p>“I know elections get really tense. I’ve been through two of them myself and I know people want to win, they want to help this campus, they want to represent students, but that should never come at the expense of someone else’s safety… It’s one thing to critique a platform and it’s another thing to hate on someone’s identity.”</p>\n<p>In reference to the “hostile” nature of elections, Kopel said she has “mixed feelings” about the presence of political parties on campus. While she believes the parties provide platforms for people who “might not have the means otherwise to run for positions,” ultimately, “the negatives outweigh the positives.”</p>\n<p>“Our campus is just a little microcosm of what our federal system looks like –– even though, by no means, is CU or IVP Democrat or Republican –– just having that split from having two parties lends itself to toxicity,” she said.</p>\n<p>“It lends itself to a divide that might not necessarily have to be there if everyone had to run independent or if there was some sort of system where there had to be more than two parties involved.”</p>\n<p>She also <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-30/associated-students-ivp-and-evpsa-elect-removed-from-isla-vista-party/\">touched lightly on her departure from Campus United</a> during Fall Quarter 2018, stating that while she did as much as she could to communicate that departure with the student body, it was ultimately hard to address her departure because parties “aren’t really supposed to be present throughout the course of the year,” as stated in A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p><strong>What Comes Next?</strong></p>\n<p>Kopel will be attending law school at the University of Southern California after she graduates with UCSB’s class of 2019. She hopes to become an immigration lawyer.</p>\n<p>She said her time in the Office of the Student Advocate (OSA), working as a caseworker during her second year at UCSB, was where she “found [her] voice for advocacy.”</p>\n<p>“I was able, as a caseworker, to see the impact I was able to have just on a small scale, but also on such a big scale on individual’s lives… my passion for advocacy has only grown since then.”</p>\n<p>But it was the presidential office in particular that “showed me that advocacy doesn’t necessarily mean having some huge movement accomplished. For me to be a successful advocate it doesn’t mean that I step into the game and get all the demands put through,” emphasizing that, to her, advocacy means “being visible and knowing that people are there for you.”</p>\n<p>In regards to her successor, Sir, Kopel said she hoped to make Sir’s transition into office easier that her own: “The transition was really scary for me. I felt really alone at first… a big priority of mine this year was to try and bridge the gap of transitions that we face every year.”</p>\n<p>But aside from the transition, Kopel’s advice for Sir is: “You have the utmost privilege of serving in this office, of meeting administration and cultivating relations with people you had no idea existed, communities you had no idea existed. Take advantage of literally every email that comes your way, every opportunity that comes your way, get to know this campus in and out.”</p>\n<p>“Treat every day like it’s your first, because it’s never too late to start something new.”</p>\n<p><em><span class=\"_5yl5\">A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the May 16, 2019 print edition of the </span></em><span class=\"_5yl5\">Daily Nexus</span><em><span class=\"_5yl5\">.</span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
