Senior defender Tim Pontius was able to score two goals throughout the game for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“At this point in the year we don’t care who gets the goals,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>A free kick by Luis Silva at the 37:18 mark in the first half gave Pontius his first opportunity, and the Gauchos a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>“It was a free kick and it just kind of slipped through,” Pontius said.</p>\n<p>Just 4:30 before the halftime break, UC Davis seized its best opportunity of the half to tie the score. A low, streaking kick toward the left corner of the goal went untouched by UCSB defenders, yet was saved on a diving play by junior goalkeeper André Grandt. Grandt was able to tap the ball away from the goal and maintain the Gaucho lead going into the half.</p>\n<p>Pontius’ second goal of the game was one of the greatest goals Harder Stadium has ever seen. With the UCD goalkeeper out of the box, Pontius was able to corrall the ball and send a high-arching shot into the goal from 61 yards out, just past the midfield line.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t happen very often when [the goalie] is that far out,” Pontius said. “He wasn’t anywhere close to the goal. I looked up and thought why not hit it?”</p>\n<p>Less than three minutes later, UC Davis countered with an offensive attack from the right side of the goal box. A shot from 15 yards out slid through the Gaucho defense and brought UCD to within one goal with 24 minutes remaining in the match.</p>\n<p>With less than 15 minutes remaining, UCSB was able to increase the lead back to two on a goal by Silva. Silva’s streaking run through the right side of the box was assisted by junior forward Sam Garza for his Big West-leading 11th goal of the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos led the Aggies in nearly every offensive category. UCSB out-shot UC Davis 12-6, had a 4-2 lead in shots on goal and a 6-3 advantage on corner kicks. Grandt’s save was his lone of the game, and his 41st of the season.</p>\n<p>With the win, UCSB moves to a fifth-place tie with rival Cal Poly in the Big West conference standings. Tie games around the league on Wednesday prevented the Gauchos from breaking into the top four ranking. UC Irvine and Cal State Northridge tied 0-0, while UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton finished their match knotted at 1-1.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos need to win two of their last three regular season games in order to place within the top-four teams in the Big West and make the post-season tournament.</p>\n<p>“We gotta get ourselves into the Big West tournament,” Vom Steeg said. “We’ve got two big road games coming up and then Cal Poly, and we know what we need to do.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42302\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-27/gauchos-beat-top-conference-team-ucd-harder/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42302\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-27/gauchos-beat-top-conference-team-ucd-harder/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-27/gauchos-beat-top-conference-team-ucd-harder/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-27/gauchos-beat-top-conference-team-ucd-harder/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-27/gauchos-beat-top-conference-team-ucd-harder/","id":1673,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1672,1671,1670],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella","biography":"Not available","articles":[716,743,762,820,848,852,1078,1644,1646,1647,1648,1649,1651,1654,1662,1665,1667,1671,1672,1673,1677,1678,1679,1683,1684,1686,1688,1690,1693,1694,1695,1696,1700,1719,1757,1761,1764,1767,1768,2160,2844,4375,4473,4491,4502,4510,4511,4512,4513,4514,4515,4516,4517,4519,4520,4527,4528,4530,4532,4536,4537,4538,4542,4543,4547,4557,4559,4561,4562,4564,4565,4566,5533],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Fail to Capitalize on Chances, Lose to Riverside 3-2","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A foggy scene set the mood for the UCSB men’s soccer team’s 3-2 loss to UC Riverside at Harder Stadium on Saturday night.

Silva’s goal was his 10th of the season, the most in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Play stopped short during the first half when sophomore defender Mathew Glodack suffered a head injury after sustaining a violent fall to the ground.

Sophomore forward David Opoku and senior midfielder James Kiffe each tallied three shots during the game.</p>\n<p>“We have to try and finish in front of the net,” Garza said. “This game is in the past.

Senior midfielder Rachel Kahn increased the lead with her own goal in the 89th minute to close out the game.</p>\n<p>“It was a little tough because we had so many chances and we couldn’t finish,” junior forward Dyanne Anderson said. “That’s what determined the game. They finished their crosses and we couldn’t do anything about it.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara held the Aggie offense to 11 shots with four on goal while the Gauchos managed to shoot 12 times with four on goal. Davis is tied for first place in conference play with its fifth consecutive victory and has two matches against Long Beach State and Cal State Fullerton remaining on their schedule.</p>\n<p>“There was such a difference between the first and second half,” Stumpf said. “We didn’t play very well in the first half. In the beginning of the second half, for the first 25 to 30 minutes, we were all over them. We had chances to score and again didn’t. We played well enough to win, had looks at the goal and didn’t stick them in.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s match against Pacific was not as close for the Gauchos, with the Tigers controlling the ball for most of the game, outshooting the Gauchos 21-7 and 8-4 on goal.</p>\n<p>“They were so high-pressured and they knew everything that we were going to do,” Anderson said. “We held our ground and you know the last minute they always put something in.”</p>\n<p>Junior midfielder Laura Hernandez scored first for Pacific in the 25th minute before junior defender Lauren Olvera increased the lead in the 52nd minute. UCSB finally got on the board in the 58th minute when senior defender Alyssa Benjamin scored her second goal of the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had a chance to tie the game with over 30 minutes left but could not find the back of the net on any of their shot opportunities, a problem that has plagued the team all season.</p>\n<p>“It’s just those opportunities where you need to score and we didn’t,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>With the victory, along with a loss to Cal Poly on Sunday, Pacific improved to 2-3-1 in the conference with an 8-7-1 record overall. The Tigers’ victory over Santa Barbara ended a two-game losing streak.</p>\n<p>UCSB closes out the season on Friday when they host rival Cal Poly.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p>Growing Up Goalie</p>\n<p>Grandt’s future as a goalkeeper was evident from an early age. As the son of a professional handball player, Grandt was able to learn useful skills and techniques from his father, a 25-year veteran of the Vorsfelde professional handball club in Germany.</p>\n<p>“He’s the one who taught me from the get-go how to catch a ball,” Grandt said. “My mom always brought me around the games when I was little, so I was always around the ball.”</p>\n<p>After high school, Grandt began to play with a semi-professional team in Germany. Grandt’s goal was to attend school and play soccer simultaneously, a feat he was unable to do while a part of the team.</p>\n<p>While athletic scholarships seem to come from every corner of NCAA-recognized schools in America, there is quite a contrast when it comes to financial support for athletics in Germany.</p>\n<p>“In Germany you can’t get a scholarship for sports … only one or two universities [offer scholarships],” Grandt said. “So the only scholarship you can get is academic-wise.”</p>\n<p>While Grandt was still in the midst of determining his future in soccer and school, a trip abroad to visit his sister in Arizona provided the life-changing moment that would act as the catalyst in Grandt’s migration west.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Google and a Goalkeeper</p>\n<p>Grandt’s arrival in Arizona to visit his sister was his first trip to the U.S., and was the first time he heard about the opportunity for athletic scholarships in America.</p>\n<p>“[My sister] actually asked me ‘why don’t you get a scholarship for soccer?’” Grandt said. “I just got on Google and typed in ‘sports scholarships,’ and the first thing that popped up [became] my agency at the end.”</p>\n<p>After completing a few evaluation and academic forms, Grandt was greeted with a phone call from his newfound representatives the very next day with some exciting information.</p>\n<p>“Two weeks later there was supposed to be a showcase for 50 soccer players in Germany that had the same problem I had,” Grandt said. “They wanted to study and they wanted to play soccer.”</p>\n<p>Grandt was forced to make an immediate decision whether to pay a hefty late fee and sign up for the showcase, or to wait and hope for another opportunity. For an eager young athlete looking to find a balance between sports and school, the decision came quickly.</p>\n<p>“It happened within five minutes, and two weeks later I was in a showcase,” Grandt said.</p>\n<p>Among the 25 U.S. scouts and coaches at the showcase was a representative from Tyler junior college in Tyler, Texas. After some conversations between the Tyler coaches and his recently-googled agency, Grandt was offered a position on the roster for the following season.</p>\n<p>“I was like ‘Yeah, let’s go,’” Grandt said. “I was in Arizona and it was pretty hot so maybe I could take it in Texas too.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>From Bratwrust to BBQ</p>\n<p>The move to Texas proved to be successful. Grandt led the Tyler Apaches to consecutive national titles and an undefeated 41-0-1 record during his two-year junior college campaign.</p>\n<p>Yet toward the end of his two-year reign as one of the best JC goalkeepers in the nation, Grandt was once again met with uncertainty toward his future.</p>\n<p>“When you’re a sophomore at a JC you have to think what’s next,” Grandt said.</p>\n<p>UCSB coaches had heard of the Tyler soccer dynasty in the making, and initially expressed interest in a player on the other side of the field from Grandt.</p>\n<p>“We were actually recruiting a forward from his team,” UCSB Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “While we were watching the footage for this forward we took notice that there was a goalie on the team that looked really good.”</p>\n<p>When the call eventually came from the UCSB offices offering Grandt a visit and potential spot on the roster, Grandt’s reaction was to be expected.</p>\n<p>“I heard from my coach at Tyler that UCSB wanted to call me out and I was like ‘Jackpot! Where’s my flight ticket?’” Grandt said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Beach Bound and New in Town</p>\n<p>The move to UCSB put even more distance between Grandt and his family, which currently resides in Germany. When Grandt’s mother and father were recently able to come stateside for a visit, both parties were thankful for the reunion.</p>\n<p>“My parents were here for two weeks,” Grandt said. “They went to the Akron game and Cal Poly game… It was such a nice experience for them to see me play here.”</p>\n<p>Since his immersion into United States culture, Grandt has experienced many new ways of life both on and off the field.</p>\n<p>“I came to Texas and went out for the first party and someone said ‘Hey, you want some beer?’ I opened it and I was like, ‘Is this water or what?’” Grandt said with a laugh.</p>\n<p>As a business-economics major, Grandt looks forward to finishing his academics before taking any further steps in his career of choice. Though pursuing the dream of becoming a professional soccer player is a goal for Grandt, it is not his only focus.</p>\n<p>“What I want to accomplish in the future is to be satisfied with myself,” Grandt said. “I’ll get my degree first … if I get offered a nice job here, why not? I could start a nice life in California.”</p>\n<p>But before that life begins, Grandt must focus on the one at hand. He has helped lead the Gauchos to their No. 18 ranking in the nation, and currently leads the Big West conference in shutout percentage.</p>\n<p>“We’re gonna need him to make some big saves for us as we come down to the final four games in the regular season,” Vom Steeg said. “He’s very focused … it’s critical for us that we have that type of player in goal.”</p>\n<p>See André Grandt and the men’s soccer team in action tonight when UCSB hosts Big West conference leader UC Davis at Harder Stadium. Kickoff is set for 7 p.m.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42265\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-26/42265/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42265\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-26/42265/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-26/42265/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-26/42265/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-26/42265/","id":1672,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1671,1670,1669],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
