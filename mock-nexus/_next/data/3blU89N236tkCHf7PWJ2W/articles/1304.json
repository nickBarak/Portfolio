What makes this win even more impressive is that UCSB essentially flipped the script from last Sunday’s match, where they were unable to muster any shots against Stanford’s stellar defense, as they held Fresno State to only two shots for the whole game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos set the tone for this game at the outset as they immediately penetrated the Fresno State defense by taking three shots in the first eight minutes, and ultimately set up senior Lynsee Voss to score their first goal of the game. With an early lead to play with, the Gaucho defense locked down, and Fresno State took their final shot attempt of the game at the 28-minute mark in the first half as they had no answer for UCSB’s defensive attack. The defense limited Fresno so much that senior goalie and reigning Big West Defensive Player of the Week Hanna DeWeese only needed to save one shot on goal on Friday in order to achieve her third complete-game shutout of the season. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the second half the Gauchos got on the board again as senior Shaelan Murison scored her team-leading fourth goal of the season at the 51-minute mark. Then, just nine minutes later Murison assisted on Isabella Viana’s first goal of the season to extend the lead to 3-0 at the 60-minute mark in the second half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB got two more shots on goal but were unable to convert and the game ended with the final score 3-0 in favor of the Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will now hit the road on Sunday for a date with the struggling Loyola Marymount Lions, who are winless on the season with a record of 0-6-2.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Head Coach Paul Stumpf will likely attempt to replicate Friday’s game plan in hopes that the defensive strategy that shut down a team with some firepower like Fresno State will also work wonders against an LMU team that lacks talent and depth compared to some of UCSB’s previous opponents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This game will serve as an opportunity for UCSB to build momentum both offensively and defensively after they dominated on both sides in their last game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lions have put eight balls in the net so far this year for an average of one goal per game. Their leading goal-scorer is junior Maki Kono, who has two goals on the season on a team-leading 12 shot attempts. She’s one player the Gauchos must focus on containing in order to come out on top. Redshirt sophomore forward Simone Handy has been one of Loyola Marymount’s breakout performers this year as she has been upgraded to an everyday starter compared to a season ago when she only started nine of the Lion’s 20 games. So far this year Handy has the team-lead in assists with two and one goal of her own to go along with it. She is a very versatile player that Santa Barbara must keep an eye on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the Gauchos they will continue to count on their two stars, DeWeese and Murison, to continue their consistent production on offense and defense and continue to build on every game as we move closer to conference play.</span></p><div

season – bringing their win percentage to .667. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s also worth mentioning, following last season’s poor away record, that the Gauchos are currently undefeated when playing on the road. Thursday night’s match began neck and neck as both teams peppered in early shots with none hitting the mark or really testing the goalkeepers. By the 14th minute of play, several set pieces were earned as each corner kick posed a threat to open the score for either side. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it was UCSB’s incessant pressure at the middle of the pitch that caused the visitor’s first, and determining, error of the game. And at the 24-minute mark, it was senior forward Sahid Conteh who scored the crucial goal for the Gauchos — bringing the home side up one nil. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was Conteh’s brilliant work rate that caused Redhawks midfielder Hamish Ritchie to force a pass back to his teammate, Nkosi Burgess. All Conteh had to do at that point was to dispossess Burgess, dribble to the right of the penalty area to get Seattle goalkeeper Akili Kasim out of position, and then slot in the ball perfectly across to the opposite post — which he did, and made it look easy whilst doing so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was Conteh’s first goal of the season, as he shares the team-leading goalscorer spot with six other Gauchos. The remainder of the first half of play saw a bit more confidence in UCSB’s play, with the team dominating possession more and more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore forward Carter Clemmensen for the Gauchos received the first yellow card of the match as UCSB closed the half with their 1-0 lead. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Highlights of the second half include two spectacular saves by UCSB’s sophomore goalkeeper Ben Roach, not to mention a shot by Seattle University that bounced off the crossbar. Burgess did his team no favors after being sent off in the 55th minute due to a studs-up challenge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was a match ridden with fouls — 34 in total — but the unnecessary red card had the Redhawks playing down to 10 men for the majority of the second half. Ritchie also went on to get booked in the 76th minute. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the Gauchos, Conteh and sophomore midfielder Sam Fletcher were also painted yellow for their fouls in the second half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, UCSB managed to hold off Seattle University for a solid 1-0 victory at Harder Stadium and they’ll look to take this momentum into this weekend’s matchup. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will be staying at home again this week for their seventh regular season installment as UCSB hosts the UMBC Retrievers this Sunday, Sept. 22, at 7:00 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

head up to the Bay Area on Thursday to take on the 4-5 Broncos of Santa Clara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a somewhat slow start to the season, the UCSB women’s soccer team has lost only one of their last five contests and their last two wins came in a rather convincing fashion.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This improved stretch of play for the Gauchos is largely due to the play of senior Shaelan Murison, who notched four goals and two assists over the last two games and was awarded with the Big West Conference Athlete of the Week award. Murison currently leads the Big West in goals, and she is tied for fourth in assists. Murison’s play on the offensive end is key for the Gauchos to win games and her elevated play over this improved stretch for the team only proves that point even more. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior forward Isabella Viana is the other Gaucho along with Murison to have recorded a goal in each of the past two games; the two goals are also the first two scores in her Gaucho career.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the last four games the Gaucho defense has been stellar and put the team in a position to win every game. The defense is spearheaded by senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese, who is currently fourth in the Big West with a .771 save percentage and fifth with 27 total saves. DeWeese has also been a catalyst for UCSB’s recent success by posting a .8 goals-against average over the last five games, lower than her overall season average of .92. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a great time of the year for the ‘Chos to hit their stride as a team with conference play on the horizon. They will want to be running on all cylinders by the time they have to face their Big West rivals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, until conference play officially begins, the UCSB women’s soccer team must take things one game at a time, and that means putting their entire focus into what will be a difficult road matchup against Santa Clara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t let the sub-.500 record fool you; Santa Clara is a talented team that has played a very difficult schedule to start the season. The Broncos were picked to finish first along with BYU in the WCC preseason poll this year, which makes sense because they are returning six All-WCC players from a year ago, including the reigning WCC player of the year in senior Kelcie Hedge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But even with all the returning talent, the Broncos’ star player so far this season has been freshman Izzy D’Aquila, whose eight goals on the season ranks 13th in the country and second among freshmen. D’Aquila has scored a goal in six of her team’s nine games this season and recorded multiple goals in two of those six games, good for an incredible start to her freshman campaign. Not far behind D’Aquila is junior Kelsey Turnbow, who has six goals and six assists so far in 2019. Turnbow and D’Aquila are by far the team’s scoring leaders for the Broncos, but what makes this team especially difficult to handle is the multitude of other capable playmakers they have on the roster, with six other players having recorded a goal in the team’s first nine games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Clara’s deep and talented roster will pose a unique challenge for the Gauchos, which means Santa Barbara will have to make the most of their opportunities on offense while also limiting the scoring chances for the Broncos on the other end.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos and Broncos will face off in Santa Clara on Thursday, Sept. 26 at 7 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

id=\"caption-attachment-89891\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / The Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB women’s soccer team recorded their third win of the season this past Sunday to put them at an overall record of 3-2-3. Behind a hat trick from senior forward Shaelan Murison, Santa Barbara was able to find the back of the net four times to give them a comfortable win over Loyola Marymount. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loyola Marymount entered this game winless and on a four-game losing streak, putting them at an overall record 0-7-2. It has been a disappointing season thus far for the Lions as the team has been unable to form an identity on the offensive end of the field. With an extremely young team, Loyola Marymount has steadily gotten better in terms of their chemistry as they look to improve every game. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara started off with an intense amount of pressure early on as the squad looked to cause turnovers in the Lion’s half of the field. Santa Barbara was able to score in just fifteen minutes as Murison scored her first goal off of a lead pass from junior forward Isabella Viana. Viana has played well as of late, as it seems that she is stepping up in terms of being a playmaker on the offensive end of the field. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Murison would score her second goal in the 24th minute and third goal in the 56th minute of the contest to complete her hat trick. This was an encouraging sight for the Gauchos as despite Murison finishing all three goals, the goals were assisted by three different players. UCSB has struggled to find players to emerge on the offensive side of the field next to Murison but that narrative seems to be changing. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loyola Marymount was able to get on the board in the 66th minute of the contest as sophomore forward Sydney Schultz netted her first goal of the season. Just five minutes later, junior midfielder Olivia LaCasto scored to get the Lions within one goal of tying the ball game. Throughout their season, the Lions have struggled to finish their opportunities inside the penalty box. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB would put the game away with a goal from Viana putting the ‘Chos up 4-2 in the 89th minute, effectively putting the game out of reach. Although the game became close toward the end, it was an overall solid performance from the young team that has aspirations for a Big West title. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara has seemed to have caught fire as of late as the squad is now riding a two-game win streak in which the team has outscored its opponents by two and a half goals. Much of this can be attributed to not only the improved offensive play but the steady play of senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese. DeWeese’s confidence and quick hands combined with the Gauchos’ stout defenders has led to an extremely formidable defense as a whole. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With just two games left until conference play begins, UCSB will need to keep up their high level of play in order to hit the ground running in their first interconference matchup, which is just a couple weeks away. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for the Gauchos to continue the success that they have been having as of late, it will be crucial for the squad to remain poised and continue to persevere even when facing adversity. For younger teams, it is more difficult in general but there are seniors on the roster who can ensure that the team remains calm in those moments. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara is back in action this Thursday against Santa Clara in an away game at 7:00 p.m. where the Gauchos will look to add on to their two-game win streak against a very talented Broncos squad. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89890\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-23/ucsb-womens-soccer-takes-down-lmu-for-third-consecutive-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89890\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-23/ucsb-womens-soccer-takes-down-lmu-for-third-consecutive-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-23/ucsb-womens-soccer-takes-down-lmu-for-third-consecutive-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-23/ucsb-womens-soccer-takes-down-lmu-for-third-consecutive-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-23/ucsb-womens-soccer-takes-down-lmu-for-third-consecutive-win/","id":1301,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[1300,1299,1298],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
