The Angels are 11-20, and we have learned that the days of small ball and a great bullpen are long forgotten. They have stolen only 12 bases so far and have a 9:1 strikeout to home run ratio. Josh Hamilton is hitting .208 with two home runs. Then there are their pitching woes. The Angels are second to last in the league in team ERA (4.78) and sixth to last in batting average against (.265). The takeaway: Manager Mike Scioscia is in the hot seat.</p>\n<p>Before the season, many experts had the Blue Jays winning the AL East because they acquired R.A. Dickey, Jose Reyes, Josh Johnson, Mark Buehrle and Melky Cabrera. Now, Toronto is 11-21 with Reyes and Johnson hurt and Cabrera, Buehrle and Dickey all struggling. The takeaway: Don’t sign players who were suspended for steroids a season ago or trade for 38-year-old knuckleballers and injury-plagued starting pitchers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>League Wide Strikeouts</p>\n<p>The league-wide strikeout rates are entering unprecedented territory. This past April featured the second-highest strikeout per game total for a single month in MLB history at 15.29 hitters per game. It wasn’t just April either, the top eight highest strikeout per game totals for a month have come in the last eight months of play. That’s right — the last eight months of play are the top eight months for strikeout per game totals in MLB history. The month that holds the top spot is September 2012, when an average of 15.47 hitters struck out per game.</p>\n<p>Many hitters will point to April’s cold, bad-for-hitting weather in many cities or the pitchers arm’s being fresher, but when this trend dates back to last season it is pretty safe to say that this is an on-going trend. So what is causing this? Twins catcher Joe Mauer has said recently that pitchers are developing deeper pitch repertoires since he came into the league ten years ago. It could also be that since the ousting of performance-enhancing drugs, hitters now have to try a lot harder to hit home runs leading to more whiffs and thus more strikeouts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Yu Darvish Can Pitch</p>\n<p>This isn’t shocking news ­— ­­­­­­­­­­­we all already knew Darvish could pitch. However, what we didn’t know heading into the season is that Darvish has a chance to make history. After barely missing a no-hitter on April 2 against the Astros, Darvish is 5-1 with a 2.56 ERA, and opponents are hitting an abysmal .169 off of him. Here is the historic part: In his 45.2 innings pitched so far this season, he has accumulated 72 strikeouts. That’s about 14 strikeouts for every nine innings pitched, which means he is on pace to become the first pitcher since Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling in 2002 to strikeout 300 batters in a season. If he keeps this up, Darvish could make history by becoming the first Japanese born pitcher to win the Cy Young.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2013 is a new year for 2012 Cy Young Winners David Price and R.A. Dickey</p>\n<p>20-5, 2.56 ERA, 205 K’s — 20-6, 2.73 ERA, 230 K’s</p>\n<p>The numbers above reflect the final regular season stats of last season’s Cy Young award winners, David Price and R.A. Dickey respectively. Now, unfortunately, both of these quality pitchers are finding out that 2012 is no more. So far this season Price is 1-3 with a 6.25 ERA and 40 K’s in 44.2 innings. Dickey is 2-5 with a 5.36 ERA and only 33 K’s in 42 innings.</p>\n<p>These struggles will almost certainly end for Price because he has proven he can be consistently dominant in the competitive AL East. Furthermore, a guy who throws upper 90s with a plus slider and good command will not continue to get lit up like he has. As for Dickey, these struggles shouldn’t be that surprising. He is 38 years old and has won more than 10 games in a season only once before last year. Perhaps the injuries are causing the knuckleball not to knuckle, but his poor numbers could also be a result of moving out of the poor NL East and into the AL East. Now Dickey has to face the big hitting Red Sox, Yankees and Orioles multiple times a year instead of teams like the Marlins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The MLB is becoming a young man’s league</p>\n<p>We are seeing a dramatic drop-off in the number of players who are still productive into their late 30s. Gone are the days where guys like Barry Bonds were hitting 40 home runs annually in late 30s. Now the game is being dominated by young and freakishly athletic players like Mike Trout, Bryce Harper, Stephen Strasburg and Clayton Kershaw.</p>\n<p>What has caused this trend? We don’t know. It could be the passing of the steroid era, which made players better for longer, or simply the manifestation of human evolution right before our eyes. What we do know is that players like Albert Pujols, Josh Hamilton, Alex Rodriguez, Roy Halladay and many other aging stars are not doing well at all. Instead, the players who are making headlines are barely out of their teenage years. In honor of this trend, here are the top 10 players who are 25 years old or younger and who are not named Trout, Harper, Kershaw or Strasburg.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Manny Machado, age: 20, 5 HRs, 21 RBIs, .309 BA. First in league among third basemen with .8 defensive wins above replacement, which measures production compared to the average player. Machado is being compared to Orioles Hall of Fame third basemen Brooks Robinson, who won a record sixteen consecutive gold gloves.</p>\n<p>Anthony Rizzo, age: 23, 8 HRs, 21 RBIs, .246 BA. Despite the low batting average, Rizzo still maintains a solid .331 on-base percentage, which speaks to his eye at the plate.</p>\n<p>Jose Fernandez, age: 20, 1-2, 3.48 ERA, 1.06 WHIP, 32 K’s. Fernandez is the fourth pitcher in the last 90 seasons under the age of 21 to throw seven or more scoreless innings with at least nine strikeouts and allow one hit or fewer.</p>\n<p>Elvis Andrus, age: 24, .246 BA, 10 RBIs, 6 stolen bases. Andrus’s superb defense and 129 career stolen bases are among the many reasons why the Rangers locked him up with an eight year, $120 million contract extension.</p>\n<p>Matt Moore, age: 23, 5-1, 1.95 ERA, 1.05 WHIP, 41 Ks. Moore has allowed only 20 hits in 37 innings pitched so far this season, which means … hope for a walk.</p>\n<p>Jose Altuve, age: 23, .331 BA, 15 RBIs, 1 HR. The only thing more impressive than Altuve’s batting average is that he is doing it at 5’5”, 173 pounds. The epitome of a baseball player.</p>\n<p>Jean Segura, age: 23, .333 BA, 4 HRs, 13 RBIs, 8 stolen bases. After coming over from the Angels in the Greinke trade last season, all Segura has done is hit, hit and hit some more.</p>\n<p>Will Middlebrooks, age: 24, .195 BA, 6 HRs, 12 RBIs. Don’t let his early season slump fool you; Middlebrooks was keeping up with Mike Trout last year before falling to injury. Middlebrooks will be a 30 home run guy for a long time in Boston.</p>\n<p>Chris Sale, age: 24, 3-2, 3.42 ERA, 1.10 WHIP, 42 K’s. Sale has a power arm from the left side and a good feel for all of his pitches. He was in the running for AL Cy Young last year after posting a 17-8 record.</p>\n<p>Matt Harvey, age: 24, 4-0, 1.56 ERA, .82 WHIP, 46 K’s. Harvey’s hard fastball, along with the fact that opponents are hitting .153 against him, has people comparing him to Mets Hall of Famer Tom Seaver.</p>\n<p><a

Senate meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam emphasized that her main goal is to implement trainings as soon as senators are sworn into office so they know “what is expected of them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam also plans on having either herself or her first and second pro tempores hold one-on-one meetings with senators every quarter in order to check in on the projects they are working on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam believes the public should play a large role during Senate meetings and referenced a resolution she authored earlier this school year which called for scheduling public forum at the beginning of all Senate meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said she authored the resolution “so members of our community are encouraged to come and speak to their representatives and don’t have to guess what time to come at.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam also mentioned her experience as a senator liaison to Take Back the Night, which is an anti-sexual violence organization, and The Bottom Line. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think I have effectively worked with those groups and really made sure they know what the Senate can do for them,” Adam said. “I’ve helped them update legal code; I publicize their events.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam also believes senators should establish clear goals to meet with their Boards, Commissions, and Units (BCUs) at the beginning of the quarter, and senators should be subject to progress checks throughout the quarter regarding the work they’re doing with their BCUs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When it comes to working with BCUs, whether it’s me or whether it’s my senators… it’s all about working smarter and not harder, so really figuring out exactly what these BCUs need and exactly what the Senate can do for them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam identified the largest internal problem within A.S. as the everyday student not knowing what A.S does. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In my time [in A.S.], [A.S.] has had this recurring problem that we only benefit and we only really interact with those who are already involved with A.S.,” Adams said. “We really need to do a much better job at getting awareness and our resources and our benefits to the students who aren’t already involved with us.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam wants to work with other executive offices to create an A.S. mobile application that would consist of all of the A.S. resources incoming first-year students need. The students could download the app during orientation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of what has prepared Adam to chair Senate meetings, Adam referenced her public speaking skills, adding that she has participated in Mock Trial, debate and musical theater. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have no problem taking command of a room and really asserting control so that Senate is running more efficiently, that members of the public are respected and so that everyone in the room is taking space and making space and being heard when it is allowed.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to how Adam would maintain civility while leading a Senate with members that come from two different political parties, Adam said she plans on being nonpartisan and neutral. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam then went on to discuss how she would conduct trainings differently than how they were conducted this past year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This past year, our trainings didn’t come until the middle of winter quarter, which not only stifled how productive we could be, but it’s also against legal code.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam said she would make training a priority. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam went on to discuss the connections she has developed with UCSB administration, stating that she served on the Faculty Executive Committee and was an intern at the Mosher Alumni House. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam’s first line of action, if elected, would be to create a mission statement for the 70th Senate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want [the mission statement] to be a physical banner that we hang in the Flying A room every Wednesday night, so there is a clear standard and clear purpose [so] that all senators know why we are here… so we start off on the right foot regardless of how elections go.”</span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.

Elections Board about how they would lead A.S. in the 2019-20 school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon and Sir advocated for many of the same issues, such as furthering transparency and extending outreach of A.S. activities to the student body. Still, they differ on the main projects they wish to create through the year, as well as their prior experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon currently serves as an on-campus senator for A.S. as well as Finance and Business Chair. Prior to their election as a senator last year, Solomon worked for A.S. Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee (SIRRC) and was an A.S. Fellow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir emphasized her background outside of A.S. during the debate, such as her work alleviating food insecurity over the past year, her position as vice president of finance for the Panhellenic Council and her experiences as a summer orientation leader and desk attendant. Sir was also an off-campus senator during the 2017-18 school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the forum, Sir noted that taking a break from A.S. involvement benefited her ability to serve the students and understand the failures of A.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I realized that A.S. only benefits people in A.S. and their entities, and it doesn’t really help the average UCSB student at Isla Vista,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I want to do is more outreach and really help students who don’t know about the resources A.S. can do to help you be successful on campus.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each of the candidates spoke at length during the debate about the main projects they hope to develop if elected as A.S. President. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon discussed three main projects for their term: a career development program through the A.S. website, instituting an A.S. alerts system and creating a financial aid advisory position through the A.S. office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon cited their past experience developing the Finance and Business website this year as a model of what can be achieved through an online career program. Solomon also emphasized the benefits of creating the financial aid advisory position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s so important to disperse information from a platform that is easily accessible. So I would create a position within A.S. who would know everything about financial aid and be able to talk to students during office hours about information they heard from the Office of Financial Aid,” Solomon said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their third goal, creating an A.S. alert system, would be a way to further communication between A.S. and the student body. Solomon described the project as an opt-in system, where students can sign up to receive notifications related to what A.S. is working on and other opportunities like conferences or grants that students can apply for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir also emphasized increased technological use through her plan of a new A.S. app which would give information about events and resources provided by A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is really important because I feel like A.S. this year had a really big lack of outreach. A lot of people don’t know about the resources of A.S. and people don’t even know what A.S. is or what Senate is. I think this A.S. app will really provide that and help get people involved and understand the resources they have on this campus,” Sir added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the app, Sir hopes to create a meal vending machine for low-income and undocumented students, which would be located near the Pardall Center in Isla Vista. She also wants to allocate funding to give students free access to Headspace, an app focused on improving mental health through guided meditation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir emphasized that the app and vending machine would not add additional student fees and hopes to decrease student fees as A.S. President. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon noted that they would not increase student fees but doesn’t plan to lower student fees, emphasizing the importance of the fees for creating programs that benefit students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As the chair of Finance and Business, I was able to see all the programs that were able to be put on by the fact that we do pay student fees. I would like re-allocate and work within how much we do currently have to make sure more of it is going back to students themselves and not university departments, and make sure that the university is held more accountable in paying for things that students need,” Solomon said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

A speaker has not yet been announced. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the second time in recent years that the union has called for a boycott of commencement speakers. During Spring Quarter 2018, United States Senator and current presidential candidate Kamala Harris and Congressman John Lewis withdrew from speaking at UC Berkeley and UC San Diego respectively after AFSCME called for a boycott amidst contract negotiations, the press release states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The union and the university have been negotiating over contracts for over two years. The main disputes between the two are over pay raises, outsourcing and retirement benefits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The union has gone on strike several times during this period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a previous statement to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, UC Office of the President Director of Media Relations Claire Doan called the AFSCME’s demands “unreasonable.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They want raises that are nearly triple those given to other UC employees,” Doan said in the email. “We hope AFSCME leaders will channel more time and effort into actual bargaining.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, the union filed an unfair labor practice charge against the UC system, </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-01/union-alleges-harassment-in-unfair-practice-charge-against-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alleging harassment and intimidation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during strikes over the past six months. The union subsequently went on strike following the filing of the charge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The University of California has used intimidation tactics to keep workers from protesting over outsourcing and income inequality instead of negotiating in good faith,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Local 3299 President Kathryn Lybarger said in the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We do not tolerate bullying.
