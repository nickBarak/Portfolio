By providing a safe space and a location to receive assistance, A.S. reinforces Dreamers’ inclusion in the UCSB community. <em>Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The resolution was authored by A.S. Senators Steven Ho and Brandon Mora and sponsored by fourth-year psychology major Lezli B. and fourth-year economics and accounting major Karla L.</p>\n<p>The list of demands include hiring a full-time immigration attorney and an additional undocumented students program coordinator, providing additional financial aid options and internship opportunities for undocumented students.</p>\n<p>I.D.E.A.S. previously presented their demands to UCSB Vice Chancellor Margaret Klawunn, but there has been “little action [taken],” Lezli said.</p>\n<p>They will be meeting with the administration on Friday to further discuss these demands.</p>\n<p>“We just want administration to know that it’s not just [I.D.E.A.S.] behind this. We hope that the administration sees this and sees the importance of [the resolution] because we’ve been trying to get these demands passed for a while,” Karla L. said.</p>\n<p>The list also includes a proposed expansion of the current center for undocumented students on campus, the Monarch Lounge, which opened in April 2017.</p>\n<p>Plans for the expansion of the Monarch Lounge include adding an additional study space, a conference room, an office for the Undocumented Student Services (USS) Coordinator, an office for the immigration attorney, a front desk, kitchen, gender-neutral bathrooms and a workspace for an USS intern.</p>\n<p>These demands are expected to “[improve] the quality of life for undocumented students on campus,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>According to the resolution, “undocumented students account for at least 800 undergraduate students” and over 800,000 Dreamers are currently affected by the repeal of DACA, putting these students in “vulnerable” positions.</p>\n<p>The resolution also addressed UCSB and Isla Vista’s history of I.C.E. raids and the overall fear undocumented students may experience on campus.</p>\n<p>Opportunities for undocumented students are limited because most jobs and internships require a social security number, the resolution states.</p>\n<p>Financial aid is also limited and often doesn’t meet the needs of undocumented students, according to the resolution. The status of these students also impacts their ability to secure housing and sources of income.</p>\n<p>“We’re glad this is a step forward to know that there are leaders of our student body supporting us,” Karla L. said.</p>\n<p>Legal support for undocumented students on campus is available through University of California Immigrant Legal Services Center, which operates out of the UC Davis School of Law.</p>\n<p>Attorneys from the center visit UC campuses two to three times a quarter, according to the law school’s website.</p>\n<p>According to the resolution, the only attorney UCSB students have access to is currently located at UC San Diego and is “constantly overbooked.”</p>\n<p>“Many of us will not be able to pursue a life in the U.S. We should equally benefit and experience that UCSB aims to provide for every student,” Karla L. said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 3 of the March 1, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

to bypass the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the second level of the federal court process, by having the Supreme Court review an order made in January.</p>\n<p>The January court order by Federal Judge William Alsup, which temporarily blocked Trump’s attempt to end DACA, also involved the UC’s lawsuit against the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>UC President Janet Napolitano filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security in September, claiming the repeal of DACA violated the rights of people who benefit from the program.</p>\n<p>The UC announced in a statement on Monday that they are pleased the Supreme Court has denied the government’s appeal.</p>\n<p>“Now that the administration’s extraordinary maneuver has been rightfully rejected, we look forward to defending U.S. District Judge Alsup’s injunction in the Court of Appeals,” the statement said.</p>\n<p>U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez in Calif. ruled on Monday that Trump cannot rescind DACA protection without giving its recipients notice in order to legally defend themselves. This allows the Obama-era program more time to protect young undocumented immigrants.</p>\n<p>Gutierrez’s preliminary injunction states that the administration cannot take away recipients’ individual protection under DACA.</p>\n<p>After declining Trump’s request, the Department of Homeland Security will continue to accept DACA renewal applications for existing recipients, while the DACA court case will continue through the regular federal court processes.</p>\n<p>Trump announced in September that he would end DACA by March 5. With less than a week to go until that date, Monday’s ruling is seen as a win for the nearly 700,000 young immigrants that are protected from deportation under DACA.</p>\n<p>March 5 was seen as a deadline for Congress to take bipartisan action on immigration reform, which resulted in a three-day government shutdown last month. That deadline is now void, since the ruling gives Congress more time to make a decision on a long-term bill.</p>\n<p>The court process is expected to take months, which may allow Congress time to pass a long-term spending bill for DACA and immigration reform. However, it may also delay action due to a lack of urgency, since the federal court process will likely pick up in October during the Supreme Court’s new term.</p>\n<p>Monday’s ruling is the third time a lower court has ruled against Trump’s rescindment of DACA, which essentially deems his efforts illegal and allows the program to continue past March 5.</p>\n<p>The first was in January, an action Trump attempted to appeal on Monday. It allowed recipients to continue renewing their work permits and DACA status.</p>\n<p>The second attempt on Feb. 13 stated that the terms by which the Trump administration ended DACA were unaccountable and arbitrary.</p>\n<p>Both rulings allowed only current DACA recipients to renew their status, but do not allow those who never applied before the rescindment to apply for the program.</p>\n<p>Monday’s ruling once again blocks Trump’s attempts to end DACA, but focuses more on individual protection rather than work permit status renewal.</p>\n<p>The UC said in their statement Monday that it was “inappropriate for the Trump administration to short circuit standard appellate procedure and attempt to skip the U.S. Court of Appeals.”</p>\n<p>They claim it was “a precipitous approach that echoes the government’s procedurally improper rescission of DACA at the heart of this case.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 5 of the March 1, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81694\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/supreme-court-declines-trumps-appeal-to-review-federal-daca-court-case/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81694\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/supreme-court-declines-trumps-appeal-to-review-federal-daca-court-case/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/supreme-court-declines-trumps-appeal-to-review-federal-daca-court-case/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/supreme-court-declines-trumps-appeal-to-review-federal-daca-court-case/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/supreme-court-declines-trumps-appeal-to-review-federal-daca-court-case/","id":2330,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2329,2328,2327],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.
