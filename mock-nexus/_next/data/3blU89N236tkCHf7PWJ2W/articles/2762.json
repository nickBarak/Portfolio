His older brother, Chris, attended UCSB through an exchange program and also played for the men’s team.</p>\n<p>“The game is more physical in Australia,” Gronow said. “I used to get kicked out [of matches] a lot, but I think I’ve adapted.”</p>\n<p>Still, Gronow is tied for second on the team with 20 points. The 6’3” driver has five goals to go along with 15 assists in seven games this season.</p>\n<p>“He is a powerhouse on the right side,” Golic said. “He will really help us.”</p>\n<p>With aspirations to play for the Australian National team, Gronow had his first breakout game against #7 Pacific in the NorCal Tournament at UC Berkeley on Sept. 19, where he netted a hat-trick to lead the Gauchos to an 11-6 victory.</p>\n<p>“It was a very promising performance,” Golic said.</p>\n<p>Like Gronow, Komadinic’s road to UCSB began outside of the country. The Serbian native began playing water polo at a young age and was a member of the Serbian Junior National Team.</p>\n<p>“His English is real bad,” Vincze said. “But he is actually really funny.”</p>\n<p>Komadinic plays center back, a position described by polo players as one of the toughest in the game. However, the freshman has been doing a commendable job, impressing the teams’ top guns.</p>\n<p>“He’s a really good player,” Golic said. “He is able to push other team’s 2-meters back and that pushes their whole offense back.”</p>\n<p><span><div id=\"attachment_26453\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">[media-credit name=”Photo Courtesy of Matt Gronow” align=”alignright” width=”250″]<a href=\"http://www.dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/freshmen-feature-newbies-play-years/usethis/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-26453\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-26453\" data-attachment-id=\"26453\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/freshmen-feature-newbies-play-years/usethis/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS.jpg?fit=1956%2C1551&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1956,1551\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"13\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D300\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1284206935\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"125\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"USETHIS\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS.jpg?fit=250%2C198&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS.jpg?fit=888%2C704&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS-250x198.jpg?resize=250%2C198\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"198\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-26453\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS.jpg?resize=250%2C198&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS.jpg?resize=1024%2C812&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS.jpg?w=1956&amp;ssl=1 1956w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/USETHIS.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]<p id=\"caption-attachment-26453\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Freshman 2-meter defender Lazar Komadinic pushes the ball up the pool.

He has committed several penalties in his first season as a Gaucho, including an ejection in the team’s last game against #6 UC Irvine within the first three minutes of the first period.</p>\n<p>“He’s a little too aggressive,” said Golic, who also comes from Serbia. “He’ll need a few more games to adjust.”</p>\n<p>Teammates consider Komadinic funny — sometimes because of his struggles with English.</p>\n<p>“We all make fun of him for it,” Gronow said. “But we try to help him when we can.”</p>\n<p>Still, Komadinic has fit well with the team.</p>\n<p>“He’s actually a really chill guy,” Vincze said.</p>\n<p>Out of the pool, Gronow has a tendency to talk in his sleep. He also sleepwalks, including one alleged incident in which Vincze woke up to Gronow standing over him.</p>\n<p>“He was in a bear pose, ready to attack,” Vincze said.</p>\n<p>Of the incident, Gronow claims he was awake and thought he was escaping spiders in his bed.</p>\n<p>“I think [my sleepwalking] used to shock him,” Gronow said. “But now he’s used to it.”</p>\n<p>Gronow, Komadinic and the rest of the Gaucho squad are currently preparing for the SoCal Tournament, which will be held at UCLA beginning Oct. 2. There, the team may have another chance to play Stanford, who has beaten UCSB in each of their past three meetings.</p>\n<p>“Our ultimate team goal is a national title,” Gronow said.</p><div

Department of Public Health’s Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses Weekly Report for Jan. 7 to 13, 2018 reported that Influenza A (H3N2) viruses are more widespread  this season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Influenza A (H3N2) strain tends to cause larger outbreaks compared to other strains of the flu, according to data from the Center for Disease Control and Santa Barbara County Public Health Department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ali Javanbakht, the medical director at UCSB Student Health, said Cottage Hospital in Goleta has seen a sharp rise in the number of flu cases. Other hospitals in counties across California are experiencing elevated numbers of cases as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At least 20,000 people die in the U.S. from the flu every year, according to Javanbakht. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As of now, improving flu vaccination rates is our best bet at reducing that number,” Javanbakht said in an email. “We’re always looking for ways to boost flu vaccination rates at UCSB since there are a lot of people on campus in close quarters, which can really lend itself to an outbreak.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between Aug. 1, 2017 and Jan. 23, 2018, UCSB Student Health administered 1,862 flu vaccines. In the same time period last year, UCSB Student Health had administered 1,794  vaccinations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help boost these rates, UCSB Student Health offers flu vaccination clinics. Their walk-in hours are Monday through Friday, from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. An express flu clinic is also available by appointment and is held on Friday afternoons from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The California Department of Public Health said vaccinating is the best protection against the influenza virus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s hard for young, healthy college students to feel the need to get the flu vaccine, but getting a flu vaccine yourself helps protect your ‘tribe’ Javanbakht said in an email. “By getting vaccinated, you become one fewer entry points of the flu virus into your circle of friends, roommates, classmates, significant others, and family members.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There would be a drastic decrease in the number of flu cases if 95 percent of the campus were vaccinated, according to Javanbakht.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This would mean fewer missed class days, fewer missed exercise days, fewer missed socializing days, and more healthcare resources available to tend to other ill or injured students,” he said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is still possible to catch the flu if a person receives the flu vaccine, Javanbakht said those who are vaccinated and fall ill tend to be ill for a shorter amount of time and experience less extreme symptoms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht reported that the majority of the flu cases UCSB Student Health sees are in students who haven’t received the vaccine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to wash hands often, cover coughs and sneezes and stay home when sick in order to stop the spread of the flu. Javanbakht also said using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer to clean your hands is effective, especially before eating. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Taking care when touching surfaces where the flu virus can reside, such as doorknobs, tables, pens, paper, ATM, keyboards, etc., and using a hand sanitizer after doing so can also be very effective,” Javanbakht said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He explained that “getting enough sleep, eating healthy meals and exercising regularly all help to keep the immune system functioning better overall.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80825\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/student-health-diagnoses-28-cases-of-influenza-since-fall-quarter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80825\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/student-health-diagnoses-28-cases-of-influenza-since-fall-quarter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/student-health-diagnoses-28-cases-of-influenza-since-fall-quarter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/student-health-diagnoses-28-cases-of-influenza-since-fall-quarter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/student-health-diagnoses-28-cases-of-influenza-since-fall-quarter/","id":2760,"author":{"id":208,"name":"Rachael Grand"},"related":[2759,2758,2757],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Internal Vice President, who acts as President of the Senate, should appoint Senators as Chairs and Vice Chairs of Senate Standing Committees.</p>\n<p>The bill changes the current protocol which allows committees to elect chairs and vice chairs.</p>\n<p>The joint committee voted unanimously to move the bill to the consent calendar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.as.ucsb.edu/senate/bills/051315-136-a-bill-to-institutionalize-the-as-innovation-fund/\">A Bill to Institutionalize the A.S. Innovation Fund</a>, written by off-campus senator and second-year history of public policy major Cassie Mancini, builds on A.S.’s Resolution to Grow and Promote the A.S. Innovation Fund, which gathers donations to fund student initiatives. If passed, the bill will establish protocol for the disbursement of donated funds.</p>\n<p>If the bill passes, A.S. Director of Alumni Affairs and A.S. Chief Financial Officer will assist in the stewardship of the A.S. Innovation Fund, and future expenditures from the fund will be recommended by the A.S. President in consultation with the Donor Oversight Committee, then approved by a two-thirds vote in Senate. The bill also establishes protocol for A.S. members to donate portions of honoraria gained through A.S. positions.</p>\n<p>The joint committee voted unanimously to move the bill to the consent calendar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.as.ucsb.edu/senate/bills/051315-138-a-bill-to-establish-mandatory-training-on-understanding-unconscious-bias-and-the-roots-of-anti-semitism-for-associated-students-senators-and-executives/\">A Bill to Establish Mandatory Training on Understanding Unconscious Bias and the Roots of Anti-Semitism for Associated Students Senators and Executives</a>, written by off-campus senator and third-year political science and psychology double major Michelle Moreh, would require the A.S. Internal Vice President to coordinate a training for all A.S. senators with the Anti-Defamation League by the sixth week of fall quarter.</p>\n<p>The bill builds on the A.S. Resolution to Condemn Anti-Semitism.</p>\n<p>The joint committee voted unanimously to move the bill to the consent calendar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.as.ucsb.edu/senate/bills/051315-145-a-bill-to-update-article-iv-section-1/\">A Bill to Update Article IV Section 1</a>, written by off-campus senator and second-year communications and political science double major Hiro Bower, offers new protocol for when campus organizations funded by lock-in fees end the fiscal year with money left over.</p>\n<p>If the bill passes, funding not rolled over to campus organizations accounts for the next fiscal year will move to the A.S. Finance and Business Committee, and distributed to any Office of Student Life (OSL) or A.S. entity “requesting funds for a project or program relevant to the specified language of the lock in.”</p>\n<p>The bill also establishes exceptions to this code, allowing Educational Opportunity Program, KCSB, A.S. Program Board, Communications Personnel, A.S. Recycling, I.V. Improvements, I.V. Tenants Union, the Coastal Fund and the Community Affairs Board automatic rollovers of funds not spent by the end of a fiscal year.</p>\n<p>College of Creative Studies (CCS) Collegiate Senator and second-year CCS physics major Liam Stanton said he was “not a yes” on the bill because he thought unused funds should remain at the discretion of Senate to supplement the A.S. budget.</p>\n<p>“If you don’t appropriate it to OSL from the accounts and just leave it in the general fund, it can be used for whatever and whoever,” Stanton said. “We have to trim money every year off the budget, and if we didn’t allow so many rollovers and we allowed it to roll over into the discretionary funds, I guess we wouldn’t have to trim because the scale at which we trim is way less than the amount of money that is rolled over each year.”</p>\n<p>But College of Letters and Science collegiate senator and fourth-year economics major Nikka Kurland said the bill could ensure students “get what they paid for” with lock-in fees.</p>\n<p>“We’re not like any other business where you need to save money,” Kurland said. “It’s encouraged that a lock-in spends all the money they have within that year, because those students paid for those things for that one year.”</p>\n<p>The joint committee voted to move the bill to old business.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.as.ucsb.edu/senate/bills/051315-134-a-bill-to-re-envision-the-senate-standing-committees/\">A Bill to Re-envision the Senate Standing Committees</a>, also written by Mancini, would combine the Senate University Affairs Committee and Senate Constitution and By-Laws Committees to form the Campus Affairs Committee.</p>\n<p>Mancini said the bill should pass to create a larger committee, which could ensure quorum more often and foster discussion on the A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p>“I feel like the fact that we are still having joint University Affairs and CBL meetings is indicative of why the bill should pass,” Mancini said. “You do need to have a large group of people to have good discussion on things.”</p>\n<p>The joint committee voted to move the bill to old business.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

She told a story of resilience amidst the hate she received from individuals who disapproved of her voicing self-acceptance as a womxn of color.</p>\n<p>She also discussed self-growth and resistance despite her experiences of toxic relationships and feeling like she did not belong to any community.</p>\n<p>Many attendees considered the speaker a highlight of the conference.</p>\n<p>“I enjoyed the keynote speaker [because] the space was intimate and powerful when she was sharing her story,” Ochoa said.</p>\n<p>Two workshop sessions succeeded Kelly-Cabrera.</p>\n<p>Sessions A and B featured various workshops focusing on topics such as mental health healing and effectively using radio as a platform for womxn of color to make their voices heard.</p>\n<p>Deborah Williams, a second-year political science major, attended a workshop called “Revolutionary Motherhood And Growing Up In The Movement: Two Generations Of Transnational Feminists.”</p>\n<p>“I got a better understanding of women’s roles and how they are changing today and how my mothers and grandmothers role differ from how I’m going to pursue my role as a mother,” Williams said. “I am going to foster that new generation with male and female equality.”</p>\n<p>KCSB-FM’s Radio Xicana host, Cecilia, lead the workshop called “Navigating the AirWaves: Muxeres en Radio.”</p>\n<p>She said her passion for the workshop stemmed from exploring the construct of identity through a more authentic platform in comparison to media representation.</p>\n<p>Hour-long caucus spaces, which are safe spaces for different identifications to bond over shared experiences, followed the sessions.</p>\n<p>Adena Badawi, an attendee from Orange County, explained the importance behind the caucuses.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it’s really important for womxn of color to have an outlet where we can all come together and share our experiences and form connections, and I’ve definitely accomplished that today through all the great people like me that I’ve met,” said Badawi.</p>\n<p>Attendees expanded on why the Womxn of Color Conference plays a key role in the fight for equality.</p>\n<p>Williams added that it was vital for college campuses to raise awareness and encourage participation in events such as this.</p>\n<p>“I think by coming to these conferences, I’m able to see more people like myself and relate to their experiences,” Samantha Mejia, a second-year sociology major, said.</p>\n<p>Maria Gonzales, a second-year global studies major, discussed the role that the Womxn of Color Conference plays on campus.</p>\n<p>Gonzales explained that UCSB has a lack of safe spaces for students of color on campus and said students of color often do not feel a sense of belonging in higher institutions.</p>\n<p>Though the majority of attendees were minority womxn, a few allies attended in order to show their support, get educated and gain perspective.</p>\n<p>“Men don’t support womxn very well so I feel like I need to step up and be an example to other men, and I need to learn how to do that properly,” Fred Atef, a visitor from Orange County, said.</p>\n<p>The Womxn’s Commission considered the day as a success, and Ochoa said that the event re-motivated her to continue her work as a political activism.</p>\n<p>“I see how important this work is in our community and how it can empower other womxn of color,” Ochoa said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
