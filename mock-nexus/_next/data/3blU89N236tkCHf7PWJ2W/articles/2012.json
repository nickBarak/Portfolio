Members of BUS flew to meet Rising in San Diego, where he was living after prison, to convince him to enroll in San Diego Community College and start his own chapter of Underground Scholars there, but multiple hurdles sent Rising on a detour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising curbed his drug use after taking a class in prison on the pharmacology of drug abuse, but he was still admitted to rehab after leaving prison. He soon left, walking away from an offer to work at the facility so that he could go to school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But upon arrival, Rising instantly felt out of place. While in class, the insecurities of his “tatted up” appearance and his age — a decade older than most — spiraled him into dejection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanted to quit. I didn’t feel like I belonged. So I called Martin [Vela-Sanchez] up at Berkeley Underground Scholars and he goes ‘Flaco, just do 90 days [at the college]. Do 90 days and shake as many hands as you can and you’re going to see that people were there that went through the same exact thing you did,’” Rising said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Three years later, I’m getting my associate’s degree, the first person in my whole entire family to get an associate’s degree, to get any college degree at that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While in community college, Rising learned to embrace his differences and founded the Urban Scholars Union, a support group for formerly incarcerated students. But two years wasn’t much time, Rising said, and following graduation, he was looking to establish something bigger: “I beat prison and I used school as a platform to end the cycle of recidivism, I found a way out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an associate’s degree under his belt, Rising began scouting universities to continue his education. He had applied to four UC schools — UC Irvine, UC Los Angeles, UC Santa Barbara and UC Berkeley — along with the University of San Diego and was accepted to all of them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After visiting UCSB, Rising was sold — in part, he said, because there was no Underground Scholars program here. He felt a calling to carve out a program from scratch, despite everyone at UC Berkeley that was “waiting for [him].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Berkeley has Berkeley Underground Scholars, UC Irvine has UC Irvine Underground Scholars, UCLA has UCLA Underground Scholars, UC Santa Barbara has nothing and neither did USD,” Rising said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He hopes to make his own mark on the campus with the creation of such a program, one that would be the first of its kind at UCSB. Operating like most others within the UC system, UCSB Underground Scholars will support students released from prison in an effort to guide them through their educational experience and walk away with a degree. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have been trained by my mentors — the other students who have come before me — who paved the way so there’s a blueprint that can be implemented to actually help other formerly incarcerated individuals,” Rising said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So I came [to UCSB] with this blueprint in hand, like ‘Hey look, there’s a bunch of formerly incarcerated students that are going to get out with their associate’s degrees and they’re going to have their 60 units credits and they’re going to be wanting to come here.’ What are we going to do to prepare to receive them?”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising said he is currently working with the Office of Admissions, the Educational Opportunity Program, the Transfer Student Initiative, Assistant Vice Chancellor Katya Armistead and other Underground Scholar programs, in addition to seeking out a space on campus to house the initiative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although still in its early stages, Rising already sees the potential of having a space for formerly incarcerated students on campus. By extending a hand to someone who could use help in school, like Rising himself, he said the initiative is a way to break the tumultuous cycle of the prison system, where many individuals often end up back behind bars because they never had the opportunity to pursue higher education.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“From correctional facilities to college, we’re focused on helping people come back out and re-enter through the college system because we’re set up from the gate, we’re set up to fail by probation and parole,” Rising said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We got all these stipulations that are thrown on us. They put us in these re-entry homes that are in the ghettos with drug dealers and drugs around them.

Yang, with Hashimoto using a “Chinese accent, making derogatory and inappropriate statements.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University spokesperson Andrea Estrada said in an email that “in addition to comprehensively reviewing the allegations contained in the lawsuit and UCPD responses, the University has engaged an outside agency to conduct a thorough, independent investigation.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brock </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019466/leading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">started</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at UCSB on April 29 following the departure of former Chief Dustin Olson, who is named in the lawsuits.

students’ time at college as it was when students first entered, and any tuition increases would only be applied to incoming students. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86875\" style=\"width: 2058px\"

<em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David Alcocer, associate vice president of the Budget Analysis and Planning office, led the discussion around the possibility of cohort-based tuition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Cohort-based tuition] could benefit students and institutions alike,” he said during the meeting, pointing out that the practice has “been adopted by a number of public universities in other states” but that it has never been done on “as large a scale as we are discussing today.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To better implement the plan, Alcocer said the UC Office of The President (UCOP) reached out to universities that have implemented cohort-based tuition to learn what works and what doesn’t, stating that universities must have stable revenue streams from state funds, tuition and investments in order to reach their principle goals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also pointed out that the tuition changes could be “pegged to the rate of inflation” so that the tuition would remain flat at “constant dollars,” meaning the purchasing power of the cost remains the same throughout each year, but the cash amount goes up with inflation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nathan Brostrom, executive vice president of the UC Office of the Chief Financial Officer, said there are numerous decisions involved with the change, such as deciding whether the approach would be for both undergraduate and graduate students, whether the plan should include just base tuition or other fees as well and how long a cohort should be defined as, noting that many low-income students take longer to complete their degree. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When phasing in cohort-based tuition, the tuition increases would ideally be tied to inflation but would affect only a quarter of the students at the beginning, “so you might have to do a slightly higher increase in the beginning to make up for that lost revenue,” Brostrom said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recalling numerous protests over tuition hikes, Regent Sherry Lansing said that it was not necessarily the tuition hike that caused an outcry but rather inconsistency in the tuition hikes, referencing the</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_California_college_tuition_hike_protests\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 2009 Occupy protests. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lansing stated that she has never seen the Regents want to increase tuition, but by not raising tuition, universities often have to cut programs and limit their growth in response to shortfalls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It seems to me that this is a perfect time to discuss this,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vice Chair Cecilia Estolano explained that for the plan to be successful, the UC would need the California state legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom to both be fully on board with the plan in addition to maintaining the UC’s goals. UC’s </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/uc-2030-dashboard\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">goals for 2030</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are to award upwards of 1 million degrees, close the achievement gap and add 1,100 professor positions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that having a steady revenue for the UC would be necessary to maintain the cohort-tuition approach. Estolano continued by noting that unexpected pitfalls in funding are a guarantee going forward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We know there will be a recession. We know there will be pressure, so we need to have some other mechanism to still achieve these goals,” Estolano said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Regent Lark Park, the issue came down to, “How do we fund the university we want?” He said that if the Regents approach this model, they need to look deeply into where the UC’s money comes from before going forward with any plans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s been very clear from the conversation that we cannot look at this as a singular question but how it relates to other issues, raised with respect to what kind of university we want to build,” Regent Chair John Perez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In closing the discussion, Napolitano said that a working group has been formed to research the topic, consisting of Chair Perez, Regent Maria Anguiano, Student Regent Hayley Weddle and UC Vice Chair of the Academic Senate Kum-Kum Bhavnani. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We obviously have a lot of work to do,” Napolitano said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-30/uc-regents-discuss-implementing-fixed-tuition-plan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-30/uc-regents-discuss-implementing-fixed-tuition-plan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-30/uc-regents-discuss-implementing-fixed-tuition-plan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-30/uc-regents-discuss-implementing-fixed-tuition-plan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-30/uc-regents-discuss-implementing-fixed-tuition-plan/","id":2010,"author":{"id":235,"name":"William Daniel"},"related":[2009,2008,2007],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
