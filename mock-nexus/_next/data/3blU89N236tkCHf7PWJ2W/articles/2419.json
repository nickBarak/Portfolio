Ottilie, addressed to the Regents and the Office of the Chancellor at UCSB, the university has suspended Doe indefinitely since the end of August despite not having charged him with any violation of rules.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Yet, even though my client has never been charged by UCSB with any violation of University rules, he sits out of school and it is now clear he will miss the entire school year unless a court ultimately intervenes,” Ottilie said in the letter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ottilie said UCSB abused a certain section of the UC Regents’ policy on student conduct to hold Doe in suspension, and he wrote in his letter that he hopes they will revoke the statute.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to be certain the two of you [Chancellor Henry Yang and the Regents] know how the Regents’ statute, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">§</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">105.08, has been abused at UCSB this year. I write for myself, in an effort to educate you and others to revoke this statute,” Ottilie said in a letter. “It seems to me that there is a pattern. Remove certain students from campus, tell them it is only ‘temporary’ until they are investigated, provide little or no support, and then just not investigate. Students without resources will give up and go away.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their brief to the court of appeal, the Regents said “the 19-second video depicting [Doe] threatening to assault a young woman amply justified the interim suspension while the University completes its investigation.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ottilie said Doe’s suspension violated the statute’s requirement that the student appears  likely to commit violence or be a threat to safety and that the suspension be the “least restrictive necessary.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents said in their brief to the appeal court that they deemed the video evidence sufficient to prove the student was a threat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Here, the threatening video coupled with additional evidence in the University’s possession provided the University with sufficient cause to believe [Doe] posed a sufficient threat to campus safety,” the Regents said in their brief.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ottilie said he was concerned about the way that university suspended the incoming student without being given charges and said he had “never heard of a school that suspends students without charges.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ottilie said he discovered the case of another student in a similar situation who has also been suspended from UCSB without charges of violating the university’s rules. The other student, referred to as Susan Doe in the letter, “has been missing her entire freshman year, suspended without any underlying investigation, let alone charges or conviction.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe filed an emergency petition for a writ of prohibition to the court of appeal on Feb. 3, which the court accepted on Feb. 7 but has not yet granted. A writ of prohibition is an order from an appellate court to a lower one directing the lower court to act in a particular way. In the lawsuit, John is seeking an injunction from the appellate court which would in effect end his suspension. Ottilie expects the appellate court will give a decision on whether it will provide his client’s requested injunction on his suspension before the beginning of the Spring Quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Ottilie, John and Susan Doe are both minority students and, in his letter, raised the concern that the university is mistreating them by providing suspensions that they are unable to legally contest because of a lack of financial resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It certainly concerns me that one of the most powerful institutions in our State has treated two young minority students, without financial resources, in such a way,” Ottilie said in a letter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada said she could not comment on the particular case, but she said the university holds the “safety and wellbeing” of students as its “highest priority.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are committed to policies that protect our campus community and survivors of assault while affording fair and consistent due process to those who have been accused,” Estrada said in an email. “The University recognizes the need to ensure that community members have the right to equitable procedures, and we strive to treat each student with dignity and respect.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: The language regarding John Doe’s emergency petition was made clearer to show the relationship between the appellate and lower court.</em></p><div

Iranian immigrants, “it’s never going to be safe” to live in the United States <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Maryam Rasekh sat in front of a computer in Iran on Jan. 27, rapidly refreshing her computer screen to determine whether she could return to Santa Barbara and complete a graduate degree.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump had issued an executive order hours earlier banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iran. As news began spreading throughout the affected countries, Rasekh learned firsthand that she was one of three UCSB students barred from reentering the U.S.</p>\n<p>For one month following the executive order, Rasekh remained at her home in Iran, unable to return to her studies at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The worst thing about it was the rollercoaster,” she told the <em>Nexus</em> in an interview Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Her first instinct was to wait. She said she had heard “horror stories” of immigrants waiting in limbo at U.S. airports as Customs and Border Protection agents denied visas that many of them had waited months — or even years — to attain.</p>\n<p>All she did was write an email to the embassy asking what had happened.</p>\n<p>Over a week later, a federal appeals court lifted the travel ban. The U.S. embassy responded to her email saying she would receive a visa once again.</p>\n<p>When she obtained her first visa to the United States in 2013, Rasekh had traveled on plane to Ankara, Turkey, the nearest U.S. embassy to Iran. Because Rasekh did not want to make the trip again in early February, she paid a visit to an Iranian travel agency to request they go on her behalf.</p>\n<p>When she returned home from the agency, Rasekh looked on her computer and found another response from the U.S. embassy. The officials told her to “hold off, disregard the previous email and just wait.”</p>\n<p>“I was still scared, [thinking] ‘will they mark it as rejected? What will they do?’” she said.</p>\n<p>Almost another week passed by until the embassy had updated her visa status again. On Feb. 16, the U.S. embassy once again assured her the valid visa that Trump’s travel ban had denied.</p>\n<p>Rasekh returned to UCSB last Monday, Feb. 27, just days before Trump issued a modified executive order on March 6, lifting some restrictions and cementing others.</p>\n<p>The new travel ban allows entry for current U.S. visa holders and refugees who have already been granted asylum and removes travel restrictions from Iraq. Students with J visas, such as Rasekh, will be allowed entry. The ban will go into effect March 16.</p>\n<p>“I scraped past,” she said, adding that many of her family and friends may remain unable to enter the U.S. in the months to come.</p>\n<p>Rasekh’s return last Monday marks the third time she has made the trip to the U.S. She first came to UCSB in February 2013 to join as a researcher in the electrical engineering department.</p>\n<p>It was during her time as a researcher that she met her boyfriend Hassan Arbabi, a fellow Iranian and researcher in the mechanical engineering department. Arbabi acted as a correspondent to the <em>Nexus</em> on Rasekh’s behalf when she was barred in early February.</p>\n<p>“He was actually more stressed out than me. Even when the ban was lifted, he was like, ‘Don’t come on Monday; come on Sunday because you don’t know, maybe he’ll sign a new one,’” she said. “He was really trying to shield me from all his stress and anxiety.”</p>\n<p>Rasekh said her sister, who studies at Boston University, was also worried for Rasekh during Trump’s travel ban. She even tried to put Rasekh in touch with Joe Kennedy, the U.S. Congressman out of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>“Everybody here was more stressed out than I think myself,” Rasekh said.</p>\n<p>For the two weeks since her return, Rasekh has been continuing her research in the engineering labs. Because of her prolonged stay in Iran, Rasekh missed a conference on Feb. 21, where she was supposed to present her research, and she was unable to enroll for courses in the Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p>“I arrived too late,” she said.</p>\n<p>Rasekh still expects to receive her Ph.D. in April, although she is unsure whether she will stay in the U.S. after that point.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if U.S. still looks like a good prospect for living,” she said. “I think it’s in the back of all Iranians’ minds that maybe we should plan long-term on somewhere else.”</p>\n<p>She said Trump’s latest actions lead her to believe that, for Iranian immigrants, “it’s never going to be safe” to live in the United States.</p>\n<p>“And it’s not just laws. Just the general atmosphere; if it’s going to keep going toward all this tension, then it’s bad for everybody,” she said. “There’s a reason people choose the U.S. to work and live in, and this could be hurting that.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, March 9, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76341\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-grad-student-returns-to-u-s-after-rollercoaster-travel-ban/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76341\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-grad-student-returns-to-u-s-after-rollercoaster-travel-ban/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-grad-student-returns-to-u-s-after-rollercoaster-travel-ban/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-grad-student-returns-to-u-s-after-rollercoaster-travel-ban/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/ucsb-grad-student-returns-to-u-s-after-rollercoaster-travel-ban/","id":2418,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2417,2416,2415],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"George Thurlow Joins CSD on First Day of Business","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-4.jpg?resize=768%2C512&ssl=1","description":"The CSD held its first public meeting on Tuesday in which the Board elected officers, established three new committees and addressed an open forum of community members.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Decades of self-governance movements culminated in a six-hour gathering at the Isla Vista Community Room this Tuesday evening when the I.V.

There’s a reason why the structure of the CSD is set up the way that it is with elected representatives,” Freeman told the <em>Nexus</em> after the meeting Tuesday. “The university has committed funds, but only for seven years, but then they will continue to have this representation essentially forever.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76283\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76283\" data-attachment-id=\"76283\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-08/george-thurlow-joins-csd-on-first-day-of-business/csd-first-day-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-1.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"768,512\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CSD First Day-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-1.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76283\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-1.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76283\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A crowd fills the Isla Vista Community Room for the CSD meeting. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Freeman said while he had hoped for a more independent district, UCSB is currently the only funding source for the CSD, meaning that the district should look to work together with the university in order to complete projects beneficial to both residents and students.</p>\n<p>“Because the only person who has put money into this right now is the university, it’s a matter of working with the university and figuring how to find things in Isla Vista that they would be interested in funding,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Director Bertrand said it is important to recognize that elected I.V. residents still hold a majority on the board and said he believes the appointees are great choices.</p>\n<p>“I think we’ve ended up with excellent appointees,” Bertrand said. “I think it’s important that we look to them as allies and also recognize that the majority of the members are residents of I.V. who were publicly elected.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76285\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76285\" data-attachment-id=\"76285\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-08/george-thurlow-joins-csd-on-first-day-of-business/csd-first-day-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-3.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"768,512\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CSD First Day-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-3.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76285\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-3.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-3.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76285\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Director Ethan Bertrand (left) was named president of the Board of Directors.

I just, I had a dream of a more separate district,” Freeman said. “The appointment process allows leniency for people who weren’t even in Isla Vista on the district, and we’re lucky to have people like Bob Geis who has been around here for a long, long time, but who knows what could happen.”</p>\n<p>As for the university’s role in I.V. through the CSD, Director Thurlow said Chancellor Yang is focused on improving the area.</p>\n<p>“He is incredibly interested in making Isla Vista better,” Thurlow said. “It’s a priority for him.”</p>\n<p>Thurlow said he plans to work, in the short term, on an internship program for UCSB students to work directly with the CSD.
