At first, there were three confirmed cases in Italy around Feb. 24, Woo said. But in the next four days, the number of confirmed cases skyrocketed to around 400, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With all of this happening, a lot of the students, all the people I talked to about it, they were just kind of talking about it amongst ourselves because the school didn’t really say anything about it,” Woo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Woo said she wasn’t as concerned about the virus itself, particularly because it is more dangerous for the elderly and people with illnesses, she said she was worried that she would have to be quarantined once she returned, which could affect her spring quarter enrollment at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was just afraid that, knowing [President Donald Trump], that he was gonna implement a travel ban and do something drastic that could leave us like stranded [in Italy],” Woo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even if we came back at the same day that we’re supposed to, if we got quarantined for two weeks, that would mean that’d we’d miss the first week of classes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the days leading up to the program’s suspension, Woo said she was frequently checking news sites and getting traveler alerts about the increasing risk in Italy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the university did send emails to students to let them know it was monitoring the situation, Woo and several other students emailed UCEAP coordinators criticizing the minimal communication from UCEAP, particularly as the situation in Italy began to develop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though [UCEAP] said they were monitoring the situation, they didn’t really give updates, they just kind of gave us a link a couple days ago and told us to check on it ourselves,” Woo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students that I was talking to knew a lot more about the situation than the school itself, or at least what the school was telling us, which was really frustrating.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About a day before the Italy program was officially suspended, Woo said students received an email saying that they could choose to withdraw from the program early. But Woo noted that, for many students, buying a last-minute plane ticket isn’t financially feasible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it’s a quote unquote optional thing, it’s not really optional for those students,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the program was officially suspended on Feb. 28, UCEAP told students they could submit claims to be reimbursed for their tickets for up to $2,000. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Woo and other students in the Florence program only received four units per course as opposed to five due to the program suspension. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While no programs beyond Italy, South Korea and China have been suspended so far, Edmond said UCEAP was “monitoring the entire world at this point.” As of Wednesday evening, the New York Times </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that at least 95,400 people across the globe had the virus, and that people in at least 80 countries had been infected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who are preparing to go abroad are being told to continue as if their programs will be held, according to Edmond.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jasmine Khamenian, a third-year communication major, is scheduled to study abroad in Japan for spring quarter through UCEAP, but Japan is currently at a Level Two alert. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In three weeks, I have a plane ticket to go abroad for spring quarter in Japan, and everything’s set, my plan has been to go third-year, spring quarter, but obviously the coronavirus and everything has kind of put me in a limbo,” Khamenian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everything’s prepped for me to go abroad, but I don’t actually know if I’m going abroad.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Japan, elementary through high schools were recently shut down, but there haven’t been any cancellations for universities so far, the New York Times </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/world/asia/japan-schools-coronavirus.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCEAP is telling me, ‘We’ll let you know if CDC says it’s Level 3’ … in that case we don’t go, but that could be when I’m in Japan in three weeks, and it can be the second day there, and they could be like, ‘Oh yeah, actually go back,’” Khamenian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the possibility of her study abroad program being cancelled, Khamenian would have to deal with finding housing and registering for classes, which she doesn’t think would be a possibility so last minute. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know if I should pack for going abroad or for going home for break only,” Khamenian added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s so many things up in the air.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the March 5, 2020 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

So that’s what we’re showing him with these emails, with the people who came out today,” Kerr-Stein said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah Jagger, the organizer for CALPIRG’s 100% renewable energy campaign, said she believes now is the time to divest from fossil fuels and do away with oil and gas drilling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “In the time of climate catastrophe, it doesn’t make sense to further the issue by drilling for a resource that we know isn’t renewable and that is actively harming our planet,” she said. “We already have momentum towards a renewable energy future, and we should be continuing to shift towards greener energy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her speech, Prufer also expressed concern that ExxonMobil </span><a href=\"https://keyt.com/news/local-politics/2019/11/13/santa-barbara-county-voters-oppose-exxonmobil-drilling-plan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aims</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to restart three oil rigs off the coast of Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They want to revive the threat of another catastrophic oil spill on our coast and in order to restart these platforms, they want to truck up to 70 truckloads of oil per day on California’s coast,” she said. “They want to do this for several years while they wait for Plains, the company that spilled in the first place, to rebuild that dirty pipeline.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to California’s position as one of the leading states in environmentalism, Kerr-Stein stressed the importance of Californians taking action for environmental justice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“California is a really big player in just what other states do,” Kerr-Stein said. “One state tries something out, everyone sees that and they’re like, ‘Oh, it works for them.’ And then more states adopt it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prufer said she encouraged students to spread the word on social media, reach out to Gov. Newsom and urge the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors to prevent offshore oil drilling in Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jagger added that she believes students “need to act quickly” to help prevent any further damage from climate change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re already seeing the effects of climate change in fires raging across the Amazon, the Arctic, central Africa and Australia. We’re seeing continually shrinking sea ice and we’re also seeing intensifying weather events like Hurricane Dorian, which was the most powerful hurricane to ever hit the Bahamas,” Jagger said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93631\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/calpirg-draws-attention-to-climate-change-through-anti-oil-demonstration/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93631\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/calpirg-draws-attention-to-climate-change-through-anti-oil-demonstration/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/calpirg-draws-attention-to-climate-change-through-anti-oil-demonstration/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/calpirg-draws-attention-to-climate-change-through-anti-oil-demonstration/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-19/calpirg-draws-attention-to-climate-change-through-anti-oil-demonstration/","id":1846,"author":{"id":261,"name":"Megan Ramsey"},"related":[1845,1844,1843],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
