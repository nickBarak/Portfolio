week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by UC President Janet Napolitano, follows the path of a number of institutions across the country that have gone </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/10/18/record-number-colleges-drop-satact-admissions-requirement-amid-growing-disenchantment-with-standardized-tests/\"><span style=\"font-weight:

As the largest university system in the nation to eliminate the test, the UC’s decision will likely have a ripple effect across the country, according to the Board of Regents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From 2025 onward, California applicants will be judged by a new testing standard to assess knowledge that “better aligns with the content UC expects applicants to have learned and with UC’s values,” Napolitano’s report read. No decision has been made yet for out-of-state and international students, who might continue using the SAT and ACT or be judged by the UC’s future standardized test assessment, the details of which have yet to be determined.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a new test has not been implemented by 2025, the testing requirement for California students will be eliminated altogether.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to move in a careful and studied way to the new future for the University … a better test should be what we aim for in California,” Napolitano told the Regents, saying one goal in the creation of a new test is to help strengthen college preparedness in California high schools. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We also want to work …  to analyze and drill down into factors that contribute to disproportionate representation, or rather underrepresentation, of students from underserved communities in our population. We are a public university after all,” Napolitano told the Regents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/uc-relaxes-admission-requirements-due-to-coronavirus-related-challenges/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and 2022 application cycles, the SAT and ACT will be optional. This is partially due to the cancellation of tests due to the coronavirus but extends the optional period to two years instead of the original one-year extension as approved by the Regents in March. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 2023 and 2024 application cycles, admissions will be “test blind.” Students may submit an SAT or ACT score for reasons other than admissions, such as “course placement, certain scholarships, and eligibility for the statewide admissions guarantee,” where students across the state with top scores are guaranteed admission to a UC, according to Napolitano’s recommendation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano acknowledged that the new testing assessment might draw on other standardized tests. In her comments, she mentioned that the Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBAC), an 11th grade standardized test already used in California and other states, could be fitted for college admission testing in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was debate among the regents over whether to continue use of the ACT and SAT while a new test was in the works, a similar line of reasoning to that of the Academic Senate’s Standardized Testing Task Force </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/uc-academic-senate-recommends-uc-admissions-continue-requiring-standardized-testing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report to the Regents</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in February, where the task force recommended keeping the ACT and SAT in place until a replacement test is finalized.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/11/06/groups-demand-university-california-stop-using-satact-scores-admissions-alleging-tests-discriminate-against-underprivileged-students/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many</span></a> <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-20/is-sat-test-going-down-at-uc-several-uc-regents-express-deep-skepticism-over-use-in-admissions-process\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">critics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over the years have shared the attitude that both income and race are indicators of success on standardized tests, with an industry developing around years-long preparation and some beginning as early as middle school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several groups have </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-29/california-groups-demand-uc-drop-the-sat-saying-they-illegally-discriminate-against-disadvantaged-students\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed lawsuits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against the UC to eliminate the test in admissions.

That marks the 23</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rd</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> time this year UCSB has earned double-digit hits in a game owning a record of 20-3 in those contests. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith also bumped his hit streak to nine games which has also seen the junior total 10 RBI’s in that stretch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, the first inning was a bit of trouble for the Gauchos and left-handed pitcher Jorge Arellano Jr. After getting the leadoff man to fly out, the redshirt freshman allowed two singles and walked the next two batters giving St. Mary’s a 1-0 lead with the bases juiced.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arellano Jr. worked his way around the jam, striking out the next batter and forcing the last one to pop out to only go down 1-0 to start.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the bottom of the second, sophomore Andrew Martinez tied the game at 1-1 with a solo shot to left center. He would finish the day going 2-4.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tie game would not last long, however, as in the top of the third, junior Kevin Milam hit his seventh homer of the year to give SMC a one-run lead again. Milam has been on a tear for the Gaels lately as he has homered in two straight now and has gone 6-16 (.375) in his last five contests. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sides would then trade scoreless innings until Smith’s big fly in the sixth which was made possible after catcher Eric Yang was hit by a pitch and Thomas Rowan lined a double earlier in the frame. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith went 2-4 in this contest legging out another triple this season pushing his total to eight on the year, just one off the single-season record. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That last triple I hit, even if I was out I was going to go for it. You have to take chances and that record is in the back of my mind and it is something I want to break,” Smith said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Smith’s home run really did prove to be the difference as St. Mary’s pulled within one in the eighth after an RBI single from sophomore outfielder Joe Vranesh but never managed to tie or take the lead again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, UCSB stretched its lead in the bottom half of the eighth out to 6-3 following a two-run single from junior Tevin Mitchell. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior right-handed pitcher Chris Lincoln tossed the final 1.1 innings of the game — impressively striking out all four batters he faced — to earn his 13</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> save of the year. The Moreno Valley, Calif. native is one save away from tying the save single-season program record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior righty Connor Dand picked up the win improving to 3-0 this year after coming in relief for Arellano Jr and tossing 2.1 scoreless innings. He allowed just one hit and struck out two.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will begin a three-game series against LBSU at 3 p.m. Friday, May 10 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

So a little less traditional archiving for community archives,” Force said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Force is working with Matt Stahl, the university archivist, on the COVID-19 archives project. Stahl said archives focus traditionally on documents like administrative records; while Stahl and Force plan to collect UCSB announcements and official documents related to the coronavirus pandemic, the focus for this project is to provide a community perspective of life during the coronavirus pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The all-digital aspect of the project adds a greater degree of access for the UCSB community, many of whom are scattered across the country, to safely participate in the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through a google form on the </span><a href=\"https://www.library.ucsb.edu/ucsb-covid-19-community-archives-project-0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University Library</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> website, interested participants can answer questions about their coronavirus stories –– where they are waiting out the pandemic, how they have been impacted and how the pandemic has changed their perspective on life — all while remaining anonymous.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Submissions could be anything from YouTube videos about a day in the life during the coronavirus pandemic to photographs of an empty UCSB campus to personal blogs, but the possibilities for submissions are limitless, Stahl said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It allows for a safe place for self-expression and catharsis,” Force said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for Force, the role of documenting UCSB history during the coronavirus pandemic goes beyond simply archiving — preserving the experiences of individuals during the pandemic is an essential piece to recovering and surviving it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re kind of acting as cultural heritage first responders. We’re responding to moments of tragedy and crisis in a different way than the frontline medical professionals do,” Force said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re offering a way to preserve people’s stories and truths, not only for evidentiary value but for self edification to capture historical moments at its most raw and unfiltered form.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stahl pointed to other examples of when UCSB archive projects were used as a response to community crises, like the</span><a href=\"https://www.library.ucsb.edu/special-collections/isla-vista-memorial-project\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Isla Vista Memorial Project</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The COVID-19 archives project parallels the memorial project because both projects ask fundamental questions of “how are people dealing with trauma,” and “how does the UCSB community deal with trauma,” Stahl said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The COVID-19 archives project has been accepting submissions through its website since May 14, but there is no set deadline for the closure of submissions. Force said that the move to a digital platform will make keeping up with submissions more difficult, as technology advances quickly and the project team will have to stay up to date with making the archives “safe and accessible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Submissions are limited to UCSB-affiliated participants and will be curated through a “quality control process,” Stahl said, but noted that this process is only to filter out non-serious submissions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that Force and Stahl are in the collecting phase of the project, the next step will be organizing the incoming submissions and data from participants, known as “post-capture work.” Here, Stahl and Force will work to preserve the files and find a place to store them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond preserving the everyday stories of the coronavirus pandemic, Force hopes that this project will open the community to the University Library’s archive work and encourage future collaborations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are places that want to tell their stories, that want to collect their history, that your individual experience matters,” Force said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Telling that story as accurately as possible and creating that safe space and kind of forging those bonds is critical to the human experience.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
