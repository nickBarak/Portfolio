For most, a year with that level of responsibility and amidst the party politics of A.S. is enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But one year later, Beasley shows no signs of slowing down. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Beasley ran for the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) position, the Nexus </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">endorsed his opponent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Alexandra Leal Silva, largely due to her three years of experience working in the office in comparison to Beasley, who was an outsider to A.S. at the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as we noted in our endorsement of Leal Silva at the time, both she and Beasley were confident, charismatic and genuine leaders who seemed to sincerely care about the well-being of UC Santa Barbara students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley is facing two opponents in this year’s election: third-year sociology major Daniel Segura-Esquivel, who is running with the Isla Vista Party, and second-year cell and developmental biology major Austin Foreman, who is running as an independent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus believes that Foreman is not suited for the position of president. It became clear in speaking to him that while he is passionate about what he does, he lacks the tangible experience needed to serve as a representative for the student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, he seems to lack a wider understanding of university and any tangible experience outside of A.S. When pressed about his experience and platform points, he faltered, and often talked in circles while failing to explain how he would feasibly pursue them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the largest reasons Foreman gave for running is that he wanted to work on improving the retention of A.S. career staff. While this is an admirable goal, it should not be the reason a student runs to be A.S. president, a position that is meant to serve all students, not just those within A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We believe that Foreman — who has introduced numerous resolutions focused on helping his fellow students over the past year while serving as an on-campus senator — would have been better off pursuing the position of Internal Vice President. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In regard to Segura-Esquivel, the Nexus believes the third-year student is incredibly capable of being the next A.S. president, if elected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the three hours in which we spoke to him, it became clear he has acquired the wide range of knowledge needed to be this campus’ A.S. president and that his passion for students is nearly unmatched. He stressed that his identity as a “brown, queer, first generation, low-income student” has allowed him to be at the forefront of campus issues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of his platform points — centered around helping students with basic needs as well as establishing emergency protocols — are not particularly innovative, as they echo ones proposed both this year and the year before by candidates running for A.S. positions. But Segura-Esquivel, refreshingly, was able to back up his platform points with detailed plans for accomplishing them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, during our interview, Segura-Esquivel often went on tangents and strayed far from the question at hand. While we appreciated his enthusiasm, his answers brought into question his ability to effectively communicate on behalf of students to administrators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley, in comparison, was an approachable candidate who was able to get his point across easily, which assured us of his ability to do the same with both the average student and administrator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, in any other election year, Segura-Esquivel would be the clear choice for our endorsement. But due to Beasley’s year of executive experience and his extensive history of advocacy for UCSB students, the Nexus chose Beasley for our endorsement, with the firm belief that he would be the best president for our campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As EVPSA, Beasley seemingly worked tirelessly to help advocate on behalf of students; the EVPSA is a unique position within A.S., involving extensive lobbying and traveling between D.C. and Sacramento. In addition to serving as EVPSA, Beasley is also a resident assistant this year. His ability to balance the two intensive time commitments while taking classes is certainly impressive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But even with these hurdles, Beasley helped bring to fruition </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-06-28/uc-gains-4-million-in-funding-for-summer-financial-aid/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$10 million in summer financial aid</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for students through his role with the Coalition for a Better UC and countlessly lobbied on behalf of UCSB students as EVPSA, speaking repeatedly to both UC administrators, including UC President Janet Napolitano, and elected officials in California and Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During his interview with the Nexus, Beasley made clear his vast knowledge of the campus, speaking extensively to both his history with the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black Student Union demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well as advocating against </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/uc-student-governments-call-for-divestment-of-thirty-meter-telescope-project/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thirty Meter Telescope Project at Mauna Kea</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which the UC helps fund. He noted that he hopes to continue both projects if elected president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of Beasley’s platform points fall under two categories, he explained in his interview: access and advocacy. He wants to continue current A.S. President Alison Sir’s projects, including her </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-18/proposed-vending-machine-in-i-v-aimed-at-addressing-food-insecurity-in-near-future/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vending machine project</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — a project aimed at providing food to low-income students — as well as finding a permanent location for the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-15/committee-moves-forward-with-plans-for-permanent-a-s-bike-shop/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bike shop</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, something also pursued by Sir’s predecessor, former A.S. President Brooke Kopel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of [Sir’s] goals were cut short by COVID … I definitely want to make sure that those projects have a home in my office and [are seen] through to completion,” Beasley said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that he also wants to focus on returning free night and weekend parking to students, who initially voted for </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/students-in-2003-voted-for-free-night-and-weekend-parking-sixteen-years-later-where-is-it/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“free” night and weekend parking</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through a lock-in fee in 2003. But that “free” parking only lasted five years; now, if students want to park on campus during nights and weekends, they are required to purchase a $52.50 permit that lasts for three quarters. Beasley said he has already had a few conversations with Transportation and Parking Services (TPS) over this issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Foreman, Beasley also aims to make sure students have “adequate access” to mental health resources and know their options, if elected. He noted that “you never really know what you’re getting into when you go [to C.A.P.S.],” adding that “C.A.P.S. isn’t for everybody.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I first went [to C.A.P.S.], there were no available Black psychologists. And when I asked for one, I kind of got laughed at. I ended up being able to go out into the community to find Acacia Health and Wellness,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to many executive candidates this year, Beasley hopes to establish a standardized emergency response protocol at the university. He explained that in his time at UCSB, he’s seen a gap between the administration and its students when times of emergencies struck, such as during the 2017 Thomas Fire and the current coronavirus pandemic. He noted that he had “countless meetings” with administrators to help address students’ needs before the coronavirus shut down the campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that there needs to be more outreach between the administration and students in terms of advocacy, particularly on administrators’ parts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students are constantly having to go to [administrators’ doors] … ‘Can we have a meeting? Can we talk about this? Where’s the funding for Black students? Where’s the funding for Native American students?’ That shouldn’t have to be a recurring conversation,” Beasley said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Next year as president, I will make sure that administration is able to reach out to students and ask them what they need instead of the other way around,” he continued.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, the Nexus believes that Beasley’s passion, combined with the relationships he already has with UC administration, gives him a leg up over anyone else. He has also shown the ability to adapt through his time in office, tacking on projects he hadn’t run on, like the TMT project, and turning them into major initiatives for his office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus believes that Beasley will use this tangible experience as EVPSA to his benefit if elected president; he has worked incredibly hard to highlight efforts that otherwise may have slipped through the cracks. He has proven time and time again over this year as EVPSA that he has the ability to advocate for change at the highest levels. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected as the next president, the Nexus</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">believes that Beasley will not only continue the work he is already doing, but use his unique qualifications to truly listen to his constituents and go above and beyond to create tangible change on this campus.</span></p>\n<p><em>Update: The Nexus has replaced the portraits done of each candidate with their self-submitted headshot. We heard concerns about the portraits not accurately reflecting what the candidates look like and will actively work to ensure that this will not happen in the future.</em></p><div

The Nexus</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">agrees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Karnsrithong and Reynolds both said in their endorsement interviews that they hope to take advantage of the lobbying process and fight for legislation that supports student needs, Karnsrithong has no personal lobbying experience and lacks his opponent’s fluency in drafting legislation and reviewing policy. This is imperative, as the duty of the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) is to represent student needs on the UC, state and federal level through means such as lobbying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Karnsrithong struggled to answer basic questions about major student issues, including those about Title IX and even what the role of the EVPSA is. He did not seem to have any concrete platform points that he wanted to accomplish if elected, nor an understanding of what exactly an executive position demands of an individual. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frankly, the Nexus does not believe Karnsrithong is a competitive candidate, particularly juxtaposed with Reynolds, who has done a lot of advocacy work outside of A.S. already. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus was impressed with the depth of Reynolds’ platform points, as her well-planned and thought-out approach makes achieving her goals more likely if elected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having worked on a number of bills with Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, the representative for Santa Barbara County in the State Senate, Reynolds’ legislative experience adds to her ability to advocate for student needs and would aid her in achieving her main goals as EVPSA: providing basic needs for all communities, providing equitable financial aid, increasing funding for mental health resources on campus, protecting survivors’ rights and lobbying for policies to diversify the UC Board of Regents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her sophomore year, Reynolds expanded her background with legislation and policy when she joined SASA as a policy analyst. There, she organized UC Santa Barbara students’ lobbying efforts against United States Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos’ proposed amendments to Title IX.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the Department of Education is currently reviewing Title IX, Reynolds believes </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“it’s extremely important that survivors, and all students who could potentially become survivors, are protected from regulations that could detrimentally change the course of their cases and their lives.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, she plans to make use of the EVPSA’s statewide advocacy platform and her lobbying experience to fight for survivors and “uphold Obama-era Title IX policies.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Karnsrithong and Reynolds both agree that Title IX is not effective in its current form, Karnsrithong’s only experience with its policies come from his training as a resident assistant, and he was unable to speak specifically to what changes in Title IX policy needed to be made.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Reynolds does not have previous experience working inside the EVPSA office, she has worked closely with the office and Lobby Corps to host SASA’s first-ever Sexual Assault Awareness Month last April. During that month, she used her legislative experience to explain bills pertaining to sexual assault to students who signed up to lobby.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds became SASA’s president and UCSB director during her junior year. In her new roles, Reynolds worked to increase awareness about sexual assault and gender bias by organzing summits and town halls — many of which were scheduled to take place in April, which is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, and have now been canceled due to the coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through her involvement with SASA, she also helped create Isla Vista’s first-ever </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-15/center-dedicated-to-helping-victims-of-sexual-violence-opens-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">survivor resource center</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in October 2019, the product of a partnership between the Isla Vista Community Services District and Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds is also experienced with the UC Office of the President (UCOP) and the UC Student Association, necessary for the role of EVPSA, who is required to meet with the UC president on behalf of the student body frequently. She currently serves as UCSB’s undergraduate representative to the Title IX Student Advisory Board. Altogether, her history of working directly with the UC Student Association and the UCOP speaks to her qualifications for the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of basic needs, Reynolds plans to lobby for legislation that would push the UC to provide better mental health services for students. She also plans to expand the role of Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) and the Campus Advocacy Resource &amp; Education Center (C.A.R.E.) through increased funding and a “more diverse staff.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds also hopes to alleviate food insecurity by working with the A.S. Food Bank and lobbying for legislation that provides support to those who are food insecure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re all fighting for these basic needs as college students. And there shouldn’t be the fact that we have to have certain communities fight harder for them,” Reynolds said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds hopes to uplift marginalized groups by facilitating direct feedback from them but maintains that she would not speak on their behalf. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think prioritizing not only marginalized communities that are very visible in the community, but also ones that may be less visible, like the undocumented students at UCSB, is important,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to maintain transparency within the EVPSA office — something that Reynolds believes the current EVPSA, Daevionne Beasley, could have done better — she plans to hold town hall-style events where students can come together and hear about the work the EVPSA office is putting out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the nature of the EVPSA office’s budget, Reynolds wants to publicize the office’s expense reports, as “students should know exactly where their student fees are going.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking at Reynolds’ work so far, it’s clear that as EVPSA, she would have the experience and drive to continue advocating for students, albeit with a much larger platform. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My passion for students’ needs and for elevating students’ voices is instrumental in this work,” she said. “I don’t think you can do this type of work without having that passion.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Had Karnsrithong waited an extra year to run for EVPSA and taken the time to hone the skills necessary for the role, he could have been a strong contender. But this year, that is not the case. For the 2020-21 EVPSA term, Reynolds’ qualifications speak for themselves, and the Nexus is certain that she’s the right candidate for the job. </span></p>\n<p><em>Update: The Nexus has replaced the portraits done of each candidate with their self-submitted headshot.

officer. </span><em>Cameron Hsieh / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the sixth lawsuit, filed in February, former officer Amanda Siegel levies accusations against current UC Police Department (UCPD) Officer Michael Little and Sergeant Gregory Smorodinsky, both of whom are named in nearly all of the other five lawsuits. Michael Little and his wife, Tiffany Little, filed their own lawsuit against the department in March 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Siegel alleges in her lawsuit that she was sexually harassed by Michael Little, Smorodinsky and an unnamed officer and was later denied a promotion after she refused to enter into a relationship with Smorodinsky. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the lawsuit, Siegel worked for the department between June 2015 and August 2019; after reporting several instances of harassment, she resigned after being told by UCPD Chief James Brock that she had become a “target” within the department. Brock took over the department as the interim chief in May 2019 after former UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson, who is named in the other lawsuits, left the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The five other lawsuits </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-03/breaking-ucpd-officers-sue-ucpd-members-for-alleged-mistreatment-after-reporting-sergeant/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Little and Tiffany Little v.

UC Regents</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are currently stalled while the university </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-08-12/ucpd-cases-to-be-stalled-in-court-for-six-months-as-ucsb-completes-internal-investigations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">attempts internal mediation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with the officers. Nearly all of the lawsuits allege violations of the California Whistleblower Protection Act, unsafe work practices and a “harassing” environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The attorney representing the Littles, Signa, Reyes and Stern did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding the status of the internal mediations. </span></p>\n<p><b>Allegations Against Little: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the lawsuit, after Siegel completed field training in spring 2016, Michael Little allegedly “grabbed Siegel’s lower back/buttocks area, pulled her close and tried to kiss her.” After she pulled away, a separate and unnamed UCPD sergeant then “pushed Plaintiff Siegel against a wall and attempted to kiss her.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In late 2017, Siegel allegedly reported to Lieutenant Rob Romero that the Littles were “causing a hostile workplace,” according to the lawsuit. She then brought up her concerns to Lieutenant David Millard, who allegedly told her that a sergeant within the department, Daniel Wilson, had stated that she “was causing issues in the department and needed to be investigated because of her gender and relationships.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the lawsuit states that after Siegel received a promotion to corporal and field training officer in October 2018, Michael Little, who “failed to get a position he applied for,” “became angry and began telling coworkers that Siegel only received her promotion because she was sleeping with a supervisor.”</span></p>\n<p>According to a statement provided by Michael Little’s lawyer, Little “categorically denies each and every allegation.”</p>\n<p><b>Allegations Against Smorodinsky: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the lawsuit, after Siegel applied for a forensic analyst position within the department in August 2018, Smorodinksy “ordered Siegel to come to his home” and “ordered her to leave her cell phone and radio in the car.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He then proceeded to tell her that she was the “top candidate for the forensic analyst position, but that he could not trust her because Siegel would not engage in the kind of personal relationship he wanted,” saying that he “wanted to get married and have babies with Siegel.” She told him that she “would not date” him, according to the lawsuit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuit states that a few days later, Smorodinsky called Siegel and told her that “she was not a good fit for the forensic analyst position.” When Siegel reportedly told him that “sometimes relationships do not work out the way we want them to and that’s just how it is,” he responded, “Well, when things don’t go the way you want them to at work, I’ll be sure to remind you that that’s just how it is.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Siegel further alleges that she faced discrimination from other officers. In one instance, while responding to a call about an intoxicated person with Wilson and Officer Saray Rubio, Rubio “refused to help” Siegel, stating, “I don’t have to do anything you tell me. You are not a real Corporal.” According to court documents, both Wilson and Rubio have “a close friendship” with Michael Little.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Siegel filed two Title IX complaints with the university during 2018 and 2019, but both were rejected, according to the lawsuit. She also reportedly filed sexual harassment complaints with a whistle-blower hotline, the university’s Office of the Ombuds and human resources.

Full-time employees are eligible for 128 hours of paid leave, while part-time employees are receiving a proportional amount. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for many student employees who send money home to support their families or juggle multiple jobs to pay their way through college, paid administrative leave or </span><a href=\"https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/work-study-and-covid-19-information\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remote work study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> isn’t enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stevie Mendoza, a second-year sociology major who worked at the Carrillo Dining Commons, is experiencing this firsthand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After I pay rent, I always have a little extra money, and I don’t spend a lot of money on food, being able to eat at Carrillo, so I keep a little extra cash and send it back home to help out,” Mendoza said. “I’m really stressed out because I help my parents with money for their phone bills and utilities, and [I] have always been able to help out.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mendoza said she was frustrated by the ambivalence of the dining commons’ upper management, who at first assured the student workers that “we would keep our jobs” after news that spring quarter would be held </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remotely</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> began to circulate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That quickly changed, however. “A lot of people were waiting on canceling their housing contracts to work, and then they waited to tell us that, ‘Oh yeah, by the way, you no longer have a job.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to UCSB Spokesperson Andrea Estrada, “Campus Dining has not let any student employees go” for good. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mendoza said she is unable to go home and has to stay in I.V. and pay rent but is now out of a job. Though her employment may be restored in the future, researchers predict that a return to normalcy could be months away, The Atlantic </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-summer-coronavirus-reopening-back-normal/609940/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> With few options left, Medoza filed for unemployment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now I don’t even have an income for myself. So it’s not only scary for me but scary for my family back home. There’s no income for me to pay rent and I’m just working off my savings, which I’m lucky I have as a college student,” Mendoza said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But I also don’t have enough to help [my parents] anymore,” she added. “And my mom lost her job, too.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mendoza is not alone. JoAnn Vo, a second-year biology major and an usher for Arts and Lectures, learned she had lost her job after reading a chain of emails sent out to Arts and Lectures employees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t hear anything about losing my job until they sent an email out,” Vo said. “First it was an email like, ‘We’re canceling all events.’ And then there was a second email [adding], ‘Oh, we’re also firing the entire student department.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vo, like Mendoza, also felt that the upper management of Arts and Lectures was “very opaque” in its communication with students and poorly conveyed how students would be affected. Though she is now home and looking for a new job, Vo said Arts and Lectures did say it was offering online positions for the time being but has not made a decision on rehiring students for on-campus jobs in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think [the students] who got the worst out of all of it were those who worked at the dining commons,” Vo said. “I’m kind of glad I had my position, to be honest.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Thunderdome, much like the dining commons, the University Library and most dorms, is now an echo chamber. With all UCSB sports </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-12/big-west-basketball-tournament-cancelled/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">canceled</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the rest of the year and the NCAA season </span><a href=\"https://www.ncaa.com/live-updates/ncaa-cancels-remaining-winter-and-spring-championships-due-coronavirus-concerns\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cut short</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, few employees are left to maintain the Thunderdome’s glossy hardwood floor, according to Denice Barba-Medina, a second-year sociology major who works at the Thunderdome. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was a really fun job. We got to watch events, like the basketball games, and then afterwards cleaned up and made sure the Thunderdome was ready for whatever other events we have,” she said. “I guess you could say we’re kind of glorified janitors.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike Vo’s and Mendoza’s experiences with the upper management of their respective employers, Barba-Medina appreciated the lengths to which her bosses tried to give her hours. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My supervisors are awesome and so is the manager. They were trying to find whatever hours they could to scrape up so that way whoever does decide to stay on campus can work, maybe like 10 to 15 hours per pay period,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barba-Medina, who lived in San Rafael Residence Hall, said she ultimately took the housing reimbursement and went home, foregoing her job at the Thunderdome and her income. But “we’re not completely laid off,” she said, adding that “we just don’t have the ability to work remotely.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although she plans to return to her job when she can, Barba-Medina said she is grateful to be at home and acknowledges that “I’m coming from a place of privilege, and even if I didn’t get anything back, I know I’d be okay.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My parents are pretty good right now. They weren’t hit too hard. My mom is a stay-at-home mom, but my dad is a truck driver. So for him, he’s been working a ton right now because he’s one of those essential jobs at the moment,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But money aside, Barba-Medina said she, like many other students at UCSB, is saddened by the abrupt loss of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-30/i-didnt-have-any-time-to-say-goodbye-to-anybody-ucsb-students-lament-a-senior-year-cut-short/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">celebrations and goodbyes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, many of which she was looking forward to before her fellow coworkers graduated. With social distancing and </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-19/here-are-the-new-rules-as-newsom-orders-all-californians-to-stay-at-home\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stay-at-home orders</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in place, however, those opportunities have vanished. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like I still haven’t wrapped my head around everything that just happened,” Barba-Medina said. “But I think we all have to find comfort in that it’s not just us, literally everyone around the world is going through the same thing.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nadia Lee Abushanab contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
