Senate met Wednesday to discuss a bill amending the legal code of an Office of Student Advocacy bill and a resolution asking for “immediate” action in support of those without legal status.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The first proposal, “A Resolution Requesting Immediate Action in Support of the Undocumented Community,” was partially written by Improving Dreams, Equality, Access and Success (I.D.E.A.S.), a group advocating for the rights of undocumented immigrants at UCSB. The resolution urged A.S. to form a temporary committee to work with I.D.E.A.S. and to increase access to Counseling and Psychological Services for undocumented students. The resolution was written in response to recent Immigration and Custom Enforcement (I.C.E.) raids in California and the expected presence of Customs and Border Patrol recruiters at the Winter Career Fair. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Abby Salazar, a student sponsor of the bill and fourth-year Chican@ studies and black studies double major, said she had opened the door of her home to I.C.E. officers, not knowing “that action would change the rest of my life.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">“They immediately handcuffed my mom and sat me down,” Salazar said. “They took her away and I went into a state of panic. It’s been six years that my mom hasn’t been able to return to her home that my parents have worked for after so many years.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Salazar said many undocumented students are currently living in fear after news of the I.C.E. raids and deportations. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">“A lot of people started celebrating New Years, but we started our year with fear,” Salazar said. “We think coming back to school would be a safe space because back at home, it’s not a safe space because our families and friends are in danger of being deported”. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Mariel Islas, second-year history of public policy major, said recent news of I.C.E. raids coupled with border patrol recruiters attending the career fair may trigger fear and panic in undocumented students. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">“When customs and border patrol comes to the career fair, C.A.P.S. should be on hand with more psychologists and therapists,” Islas said. “That way, students who do feel triggered have the ability and the means to contact someone in C.A.P.S. who are able to help them.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Islas said she collaborated with A.S. senators Alejandra Melgoza and Jose Magana, who proposed that she write a resolution.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Alejandra Melgoza, an off-campus senator and third-year Chican@ studies major, said she supports the resolution because of the stress and pressure undocumented students have to face while pursuing their education. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">“There have been a lot of raids in our community,” Melgoza said. “There are articles that state they are continuing in Santa Barbara county, so this presents a lot of mental health stress not only on these students here in this community, but they also worry about their families back home, friends, community members.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">In the fall of 2013, the 64th A.S Senate voted against passing “A Resolution in Support of Undocumented Student and Immigrant Communities,” which requested A.S. express no confidence toward former Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, who is now president of the University of California.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Salazar said it is important for Senate to repair its relationship with the undocumented student population at UCSB in order to fully represent the student body. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Two years after, A.S. Senate voted down the previous resolution, Salazar said, “Now we’re back in the same place. We’re coming here for the 66th Senate to amend those actions and to really support undocumented students right now because undocumented students are facing really difficult times.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">“A Bill to Amend Lobby Corps Legal Code” and “A Bill to Update CFF By-Laws” were sent to Campus Affairs. “A Bill to Amend the Legal Code of the OSA Bill” and “A Resolution Requesting Immediate Action in Support of the Undocumented Community” were passed unanimously. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\n</p><p class=\"p4\">[Correction: This story originally read  “a resolution asking for ‘immediate’ action in support of those who immigrated to the country illegally.” The wording was changed to “those without legal status” to more accurately describe the purpose of the resolution.]</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67418\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-15/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-to-support-the-undocumented-community-amends-legal-code-bill/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67418\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-15/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-to-support-the-undocumented-community-amends-legal-code-bill/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-15/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-to-support-the-undocumented-community-amends-legal-code-bill/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-15/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-to-support-the-undocumented-community-amends-legal-code-bill/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-15/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-to-support-the-undocumented-community-amends-legal-code-bill/","id":2578,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[2577,2576,2575],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga","biography":"Not available","articles":[2578,2579,2586,2593,2645,2675,3603,3854,4609,4636],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Theater &amp; Dance Department and Music Department.</p>\n<p>Following the performance, Head Librarian Denise Stephens spoke of the library’s central role in UCSB history, noting that the library was the original building constructed on Santa Barbara’s campus in 1954.</p>\n<p>“The UCSB library, from its beginning, was meant to be the physical and geographical center of UCSB,” Stephens said.</p>\n<p>Stephens said the library renovation focused on technological and educational innovations as well as creating more student and faculty study space.</p>\n<p>“More than just a renovation of outdated buildings, we began a reimagining of what resource services could be,” Stephens said. “[It has] bright inspiring resource galleries which provide spaces to study and think … and a

means to be a Gaucho, but there is nothing more familiar to every student here than heading to the library to work on a paper or study for an exam,” Villarreal said.</p>\n<p>Villarreal praised the addition of 1,800 new electrical outlets during the renovation and announced that the UCSB Library’s Learning Commons would be the recipient of the 2016 Senior Class Gift. The gift will come in the form of a combination of high tech study resources including a dedicated 3-D printer.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang highlighted the importance of libraries on campuses, saying the UCSB Library receives over 1.5 million visits a year.</p>\n<p>“As a hub of information, a library is a key component of inspiring original thought, creativity and communication,” Yang said. “As we celebrate the opening of this phenomenal building, let us also celebrate the bright future it represents for our campus.”</p>\n<p>Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall said that it was “important this ceremony is being held at the ‘Paseo.’”</p>\n<p>“This passage is not a corridor, it’s a vital artery in the heart of the campus,” Marshall said.</p>\n<p>Marshall finished on a more personal note, focusing on the library’s role in students’ lives and what it symbolizes to an academic community.</p>\n<p>“The library remains a place of learning and teaching, the crossroads of tradition and innovation, a laboratory of discovery and reinvention,” Marshall said. “Our new library offers a safe refuge space for quiet study and contemplation. It’s a place to lose oneself and to find oneself alongside others.”</p>\n<p>Following Marshall’s speech, representatives from State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson and Assemblymember Das Williams’ offices presented Yang and Stephens with a plaque commemorating the opening of the renovated library.</p>\n<p>Aaron Jones, Associated Students advisor and Graduate Student Association president, said current U.S. culture celebrates the addictions of money, power and prestige and instead invited all in attendance to celebrate the addiction to truth.</p>\n<p>“I have chosen this opportunity to invite you all to share a different type of addiction, something we can all be addicted to and not be ashamed of,” Jones said. “The addiction to truth, the addiction to the acquisition of knowledge, the addiction to finding our own individual answers to questions posed in the classroom and throughout our daily lives. That addiction, that quest, is what our newly renovated library inspires me to share with you.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67373\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67373\" data-attachment-id=\"67373\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/ceremony-held-for-opening-of-new-library/student-speaker/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"student speaker\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452701975\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00025\",\"title\":\"student speaker\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"student speaker\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-67373\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1-1024x678.jpg?resize=888%2C588\" alt=\"student speaker\" width=\"888\" height=\"588\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Library_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67373\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Following Jones’ speech, Yang cut a ceremonial ribbon and welcomed all in attendance to come explore the space while musical and dance groups performed throughout the library.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Katya Armistead said she wants to try out every chair in the building.</p>\n<p>“The chairs are amazing; I’ve sat on four different types so far, so it’s really fun to check out all of them,” Armistead said. “There’s some tall stools, there’s some that are kinda like arm chairs, and then, [check] out these chairs in the training room, they contour to your body very nicely.”<br>\nArmistead said she is already in love with the new library addition, although she is worried it may still be too small for the hordes of students who come to study.</p>\n<p>“I love how the entrance is so grand and inviting.

id=\"caption-attachment-67368\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rasheed Shabazz via Afrikan Black Coalition</p></div>\n<p>Black student leaders across the University of California (UC) increased pressure on Wells Fargo this week to divest from private prisons.</p>\n<p>Students from the Afrikan Black Coalition (ABC), an alliance of black student groups on nine UC campuses, released a statement Monday demanding Wells Fargo sell its shares in private prisons and end all business relations with the companies by Feb. 20. According to the statement, if Wells Fargo fails to do so by the deadline, ABC will continue to pressure the UC to divest its $425 million invested with Wells Fargo. ABC pressured UC to divest from private prisons in December, prompting UC to sell approximately $25 million in private prison shares.</p>\n<p>Nia Mitchell, UCSB Black Student Union Political Chair and fourth-year environmental studies major, said black students remain upset that the UC invests in Wells Fargo despite selling its shares in private prison corporations. Mitchell said she believes Wells Fargo contributes to private prison funding.</p>\n<p>“We cannot be complacent with the fact that our tuition is being invested, either indirectly or directly, to the incarceration of our people,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>ABC spokesperson Anthony Williams, citing research conducted by Enlace’s Private Prison Divestment Campaign, said Wells Fargo is financially invested in private prison corporations such as Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) and The GEO Group (GEO) in several ways.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, Wells Fargo owns 1.5 million shares in GEO and CCA, acts as an issuing lender on CCA’s $900 million line of credit and serves as bond trustee to GEO’s $300 million corporate debt.</p>\n<p>“They are funding private prisons,” Williams said. “Wells Fargo is completely complicit in private prisons and what they do and how they treat people, which is horrid.”</p>\n<p>According to Wells Fargo spokesperson Ruben Pulido, the bank bears no financial investment in either GEO or CCA. Pulido said Wells Fargo Funds, owned by the funds’ investors and not Wells Fargo, currently holds a small position in the companies through a passive index fund.</p>\n<p>“Wells Fargo holds no investment in either The GEO Group or the Corrections Corporation of America,” Pulido said in an email. “We have no seat on either company’s board of directors, and we do not dictate their policies or business models.”</p>\n<p>UCSB economics professor Henning Bohn said Wells Fargo provides passive index funds for customers to invest in other companies, which is a product that “any random financial firm” would offer to its customers. Bohn said Wells Fargo customers own the shares in private prison corporations, not Wells Fargo.</p>\n<p>“From an economic perspective, I would say [Wells Fargo] doesn’t really hold an economic interest because the interest is held by their customers — those are the beneficiaries,” Bohn said.</p>\n<p>Bohn said if Wells Fargo were to end all investments in private prison corporations through index funds, the bank would first have to withdraw all index fund products, and would only offer funds investing in companies in which the bank wants clients to invest.</p>\n<p>“That’s something that Wells Fargo is probably not going to do,” Bohn said.</p>\n<p>Mitchell said she does not believe the distinction between Well Fargo and Wells Fargo Funds makes a difference.</p>\n<p>“It’s still Wells Fargo,” Mitchell said. “You can separate it however you want bureaucratically, but it is the arm of the same system.”</p>\n<p>According to Mitchell, black student leaders want UC and other “financiers” to divest from for-profit prisons because of how incarceration oppresses black people.</p>\n<p>“Private prisons literally make a profit off of the incarceration of people, who, within a system that’s rooted in white supremacy and capitalism, are for the most part black and brown bodies,” Mitchell said. “Their system of mass incarceration has not helped the black community.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the business model of private prisons requires they lobby for criminal justice and immigration policies to incarcerate as many people as possible. Williams also said these policies generally lead to the disproportionate number of racial minorities in the prison facilities of corporations like GEO and CCA.</p>\n<p>“Their business model is getting as many people incarcerated as possible and having contracts, and if they can’t do that, then how are they going to make money?” Williams said.</p>\n<p>According to CCA Director of Public Affairs Jonathan Burns, CCA does not take an active stance on public policies affecting incarceration.</p>\n<p>“To be clear, CCA does not draft, lobby for or in any way promote policies that determine the basis for or duration of an individual’s incarceration or detention,” Burns said in an email.</p>\n<p>GEO Vice President of Corporate Relations Pablo Paez also said he “vehemently refutes” these charges.</p>\n<p>“The allegation that our company has engaged in lobbying and advocacy for public policies that are detrimental to communities is simply not accurate,” Paez said. “Our company has never taken a position on criminal justice or immigration policies.”</p>\n<p>Paez said GEO helps those who are incarcerated by investing millions of dollars into rehabilitation and re-entry programs for prisoners to transition more smoothly back into society.</p>\n<p>“Groups like this one advance the notion that groups in our industry are somehow unaccountable to the government and to the public,” Paez said. “What we’ve done over the years is counter the rhetoric that is being advanced by groups like that of the University of California.”</p>\n<p>Williams said there is nothing a private prison corporation like GEO can do to be accountable to the public except to close its doors.</p>\n<p>“For private prison organizations to be accountable to the public, they would have to shut down,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Jan. 14 issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67385\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/students-demand-private-prison-divestment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67385\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/students-demand-private-prison-divestment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/students-demand-private-prison-divestment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/students-demand-private-prison-divestment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/students-demand-private-prison-divestment/","id":2577,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2576,2575,2574],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
