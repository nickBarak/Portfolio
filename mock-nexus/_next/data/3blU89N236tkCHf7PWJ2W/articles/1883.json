Courtesy of Dahlia Hylton</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last March, Chancellor Henry T. Yang </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/chancellor-yang-promises-fulfillment-of-multiple-bsu-demands/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">promised</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to provide funding from his office for the creation of the office, the hiring of eight staff members — of which Hylton is the first — and $55,000 annually for programming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the creation of the office, Yang said that the development of a Center for Black Student Development, which is meant to be a standalone building, would be “an important priority within campus planning.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands were </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">presented</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the BSU demands team in February and fulfilled by Yang in March but were built upon over 50 years of activism from previous generations of BSU students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hylton was selected after a national search by a committee comprised of members of the BSU demands team, as well as other campus leaders, according to Assistant Vice Chancellor for Student Academic Support Systems Lupe Navarro-Garcia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hylton said she hadn’t heard about the demands before she saw the job announcement, but that she was aware of “some type of forward movement that was happening, as to why this office was being created.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like I’m someone who literally stands on the shoulders of people who look like me, and to be able to be a vessel, if you will, for the amazing work that this institution has done,” Hylton said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students have played such a significant part in bringing this office together.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, a job posting by the Division of Student Affairs described the role of director as an individual who is both capable of overseeing and advising entities — such as the Black Resource Committee and Black Student Union (BSU) — while leading in strategic planning and participating in organizations from the local to national level. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The search committee wanted someone that really understood the diversity within the Black community and really had a commitment to intersectional identities and making sure that everyone that set foot in the place where we have that space, or was interfacing with anyone with the office felt welcomed, seen and understood,” said Meridith Merchant, assistant director for Mental Health Initiatives and Inclusion for Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) and member of the search committee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navarro-Garcia noted that Hylton has worked in various multicultural affairs offices at different campuses and at her most recent university, Lehigh University, grew the office from one person to a full staff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the work that I have done, particularly within higher education, has been around diversity and inclusion,” Hylton added. “Even when I was cultivating those skills in undergrad and graduate, I just always gravitated towards a space like this.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hylton noted that she has worked in advising offices, Educational Opportunity Program offices and admissions offices in addition to her work in multicultural spaces and said she’s looking forward to working with various offices at UCSB to help students in any way they need.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to hold true to the demands that the students brought forth and however that actually manifests its ways, then we’ll actually do that,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, Hylton said she’s focusing her time on learning what exactly the needs of the student are, and how she can help facilitate them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her first few days, she said she spent time getting to know a lot of different people on campus and building relationships, which she described as key to a position like hers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been able to meet, in my opinion, with some really great, great allies, or potential allies, of the space, and everyone seems so excited, which has given me a lot of energy,” Hylton said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, she’s ready to get to work creating a strategic plan for the office and begin hiring other staff members.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navarro-Garcia said they have already hired an assistant director who will begin Feb. 3, and are in the process of looking for an advocacy counselor and an administrative business officer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As OBSD moves forward in filling positions, Merchant said “we have to be very intentional and thoughtful” in making future hires, as to meet the BSU demands and properly accommodate new employees as they arrive on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Do we have space in our suite here for the first tier [of hiring]?” Navarro-Garcia said. “And then we need to start thinking where are we moving to advance to the hiring of tier two and tier three.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a similar sense, Merchant emphasized the need to continue developing OBSD’s infrastructure in an effort to make future employees feel they can perform their job to the fullest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Santa Barbara is not the most diverse place to be. UC Santa Barbara is diverse, but Santa Barbara as a whole [is not],” Merchant said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you’re inviting people to positions where they’re going to be supporting multicultural students, it’s important that there is the infrastructure, so that you can draw people that will feel supported and be able to continue to do the great work that they’re doing,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Hylton, she’s looking forward to doing just that. In the future, she hopes to help create a space where Black students can seek “empowerment, education and inspiration,” while providing them with the resources they need to succeed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s really important that UC Santa Barbara realizes that Blackness isn’t monolithic. There’s so many different variations as to who we are as individuals. And to have this office to a vessel or a conduit to helping people understand what those many different nuances of Blackness is going to be really important.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 23 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Much of the discussion at the Monday meeting, which included representatives from various campus offices and student organizations, centered around the recent regulations and how they were being enforced.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The policies were] generated through a lot of really collaborative conversations among all of our IFC organizations along with Panhellenic organizations, and [by] communicating amongst all Greek leadership as well as discussing and considering input from other community members,” Stone began. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re really hopeful that some of this can be translated to all community and campus organizations so that all of those events can become safer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The policies apply to all Interfraternity Council (IFC) organizations, which include Alpha Gamma Omega, Alpha Tau Omega, Delta Tau Delta, Kappa Sigma, Sigma Chi, Sigma Nu, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Sigma Pi, Zeta Beta Tau and Zeta Psi. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first policy Stone introduced, and the one he described as the biggest change, was the addition of mandatory “sober hosts” at all IFC events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Essentially what that means is the hosting organization, or organizations… [have] a collection of sober host monitors who are there to take charge, take the lead, make sure that everything is running as it should be. If there were any concerns or any issues that came up, those would be the first points of contact,” Stone said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In addition to just having those people present at the events, we also have outlined ways for them to be very clearly identifiable,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone also clarified later in the discussion that all sober hosts are required to wear neon vests, similar to those construction workers wear, so they can be easily recognized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s one thing, especially at a crowded event, to be sober or to be in charge. It’s entirely another for other people to know that that [a] person is in charge and capable of handling anything that may come up,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone said the neon vest requirement is consistent across all IFC fraternities, so that if an individual attends multiple IFC events in one night, they would still be able to find a sober host easily. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current required ratio is three sober hosts for the first 50 guests, and then an additional sober host for every 25 additional guests, Stone said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to mandating sober hosts at all IFC events, Stone said that fraternities are beginning to set up sober stations that would serve water and act as an area for attendees to step away from the party. Stone added that the station would also serve as a “centralized location” for the sober hosts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IFC is also requiring that a sober host be stationed at the entrance of each social event, in order to ensure there is a “competent entry process going on,” Stone said, and so sober hosts can introduce themselves to anyone coming in who might not be aware of their presence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another significant change the IFC implemented was the banning of hard alcohol — all alcohol above 15% ABV — which Stone said was a policy adopted from the council’s </span><a href=\"https://nicfraternity.org/nic-fraternities-vote-to-ban-hard-alcohol/?fbclid=IwAR1TaN_dwv3g5NTXg_UhsN-lkzek0IewPHSVJRlAJlXjf2kz1wbD8cBLMO4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">national organization</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That has been a really important shift, especially when it comes to our discussion of blackout culture and the effect that that has in Isla Vista in general,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone also added that the IFC is now mandating that water be served at all social events. He also clarified that these policies would apply for all social events, not just those held in I.V., but also for off-site events like in downtown Santa Barbara when organizations might rent out a venue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jennifer Selvidge, a representative from the Graduate Student Association, noted during the Q&amp;A portion that she wanted the committee to discuss developing a policy that would address the issue of date-rape drugs, the use of which is often premeditated, particularly since an individual would likely purchase them while sober, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ally van Dorsten, the Collegiate Panhellenic Council president, noted that the hard alcohol ban essentially means that there will be no open containers at IFC social events now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s not a lot of opportunity at these events for people to be drugging, because it’s all closed, individual, single container alcohol that is being served to people of age,” van Dorsten said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know if the rules that IFC has implemented [are] capable of that reach of trying to prevent people from roofie-ing other people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Maybe this is just beyond the scope of what I think is tangible and possible right now for improvement right now. I don’t know if it’s possible to use these rules to stop people who have a sober intent of hurting someone else,” van Dorsten added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vince Matthew Feliciano, the vice president for Students Against Sexual Assault, pressed Stone about how the sober hosts would be held accountable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone said the council had purchased breathalyzers, and has been dropping in on various IFC events to breathalyze the sober hosts. If someone is found to not have a 0.00 blood alcohol level, Stone said the event would immediately be shut down. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All IFC fraternities are now required to register their events with the IFC ahead of time, Stone added, so that the council would be able to check on all the sober hosts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Briana Conway, director for Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education, asked Stone about how fraternity members reacted to the hard alcohol ban.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would love to hear how members are feeling about a hard alcohol ban — not leaders, members,” Conway said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone acknowledged that he faced pushback when first introducing the idea, but said IFC spent time talking to not just fraternity leadership, but with general body members at chapter meetings about all the changes the IFC was introducing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At first, it was definitely not an easy sort of conversation, it was not something that everyone was super excited to sort of take on,” Stone said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, Conway noted that many students might drink more heavily before the event if they know they won’t have access to hard alcohol at the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanna make sure we’re not moving the problem maybe earlier in the night,” Conway said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone said the sober hosts would play a role in this as well, making sure that people entering the event aren’t too intoxicated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">van Dorsten added that she’s noticed that even if people are drinking heavily before attending a fraternity event, it’s typically easier to notice — and take care of someone — at a pregame, as opposed to if someone is binge-drinking at a fraternity event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone stressed at the Monday meeting that these regulations were just the first step in trying to reduce harm, or the potential for harm, at fraternity social events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The one thing I do want to emphasize is that this is absolutely an ongoing process for us, as I think it should be for everyone. Risk prevention doesn’t end after you change one rule, it’s ongoing, and it’s to continue to create a safer and safer environment.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

But as any hardcore Eagles fan will tell you, don’t say Super Bowl just yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Injuries, and Lots of Them</strong></p>\n<p>Many factors come into play when analyzing the current success of this Eagles squad. However, a good place to start would be the team’s ability to overcome several injuries to very key positions.</p>\n<p>In Week 1, star cornerback Ronald Darby, former PFF Rookie Defensive Player of the Year, went down with a dislocated right ankle injury, sidelining him all season thus far.</p>\n<p>Two games later, running back Darren Sproles tore his ACL and broke his arm, eliminating perhaps the Eagles’ best playmaker at the time. Week 7 signaled the season-ending loses of two pivotal players as future Hall of Famer left tackle Jason Peters was carted off and middle linebacker sensation Jordan Hicks was locker room-bound.</p>\n<p>These are just a few of the countless roadblocks that Philadelphia has had to deal with. Yet, considering they’ve made it this far and have still managed a best in the league performance week in and week out, the Eagles are really promoting a “next one up” mentality throughout their roster of players.</p>\n<p>Luckily, Darby and second-round draft pick Sidney Jones IV are due back any time now, meaning that the Eagles defensive productivity will soon match their offensive output. So word to the wise, no longer should only the NFC East be afraid, but the entire NFL should be as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Next-One-Up </strong></p>\n<p>This phrased mindset refers to how well a team’s substitutes and second-string players can acclimate and produce when called upon following injuries to starters. More specifically, how well Philadelphia’s depth chart has adjusted to such mishaps has been a dimension of its momentum.</p>\n<p>Starting with the cornerbacks, former seventh-round pick Jalen Mills has played solidly through his sophomore year with three interceptions and one “pick-six” touchdown return. Veteran corner Patrick Robinson was brought in to help as a rotational player, yet he is now graded as the No. 3 CB with a PFF defensive grade of 91.2.</p>\n<p>As for the receiving corps, Nelson Agholor has done a complete 180 in terms of his poor performance last year. With 428 yards and five touchdowns through nine games, Agholor can definitely be considered a candidate for the NFL’s Most Improved award. Meanwhile, fourth-string wide receiver Mack Hollins has shown some flashy playmaking ability while only being a fourth-round steal of a rookie.</p>\n<p>Concerning the team’s run game, this is where the Eagles have most notably gone off, even with Sproles’s absence.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the many talents of LeGarrette Blount, Corey Clement and Wendell Smallwood, the Eagles are fourth in the NFL in rushing yards per game with a 136.8 average. Oh, and they recently traded for pro-bowl running back Jay Ajayi.</p>\n<p>Altogether, this is a team that wants to win, and their coaching staff will do their best to appropriately rotate everyone into the play scheme.</p>\n<p><strong>The Art of the Trade</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s back track a little bit and comprehend just how much of a robbery it was when the Eagles traded one of their three fourth-round picks to the Miami Dolphins for Ajayi. With a year of NFL play under his belt, Ajayi exploded onto the NFL scene last season.</p>\n<p>Ajayi has already been to the Pro Bowl and was considered as high as a top-five running back talent entering the 2017-18 season. So one must begin to question how on Earth a player of Ajayi’s caliber, who averaged 4.9 yards per carry last year, managed to be practically gifted to the Eagles.</p>\n<p>Simply put, the answer is Howie Roseman, who is the executive vice president of Philadelphia’s football operations.</p>\n<p>Roseman has pretty much been the brains behind most of the great Eagles’ trades since this past offseason. With him bringing in names such as Alshon Jeffery, LeGarrette Blount, Timmy Jernigan and Ronald Darby, it’s clear to see that the office personnel has placed the team in a position to succeed with their key decision-making.</p>\n<p>In turn, Head Coach Doug Pederson and defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz have done their best to play these free agents and new players.</p>\n<p>Altogether, it’s paid off thus far. Philadelphia’s current outlook is very bright, as the team is spearheaded by the potential league MVP in second-year quarterback Carson Wentz.</p>\n<p>As previously mentioned, the Super Bowl is in the back of fans’ and players’ minds alike, and the excitement is definitely brewing as the wins keep stacking up.</p>\n<p>However, there’s still much of the season left, and topping the Eagles’ list of priorities would be ensuring a first-round bye come postseason time.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Nov. 16, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79752\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/the-eagles-arent-as-good-as-you-think-theyre-actually-better/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79752\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/the-eagles-arent-as-good-as-you-think-theyre-actually-better/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/the-eagles-arent-as-good-as-you-think-theyre-actually-better/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/the-eagles-arent-as-good-as-you-think-theyre-actually-better/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/the-eagles-arent-as-good-as-you-think-theyre-actually-better/","id":1882,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1881,1880,1879],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Blast From the Past: Rookie Flashbacks of Today’s NBA Stars","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nbablogbig.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nbablogbig.jpg?resize=980%2C623&ssl=1","description":"The 2017-18 NBA season is among us.

Now, it’s time to explore the journeys of players who were once in their shoes and are now at the top of the game.<br>\nIn honor of the return of NBA basketball, here is a list of today’s biggest names and how they did in their introductions to the league.</p>\n<p><strong>LeBron James: Oct. 29, 2003 – Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Sacramento Kings</strong><br>\nIt was during LeBron James’s senior year of high school at St. Vincent-St. Mary’s that he tattooed “Chosen 1” on his upper back after being featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Getting such ink is likely something many would deem as risky, but “King James” has lived up to the moniker as one of the best ever, as he just began his 15th NBA season.<br>\nStill, to this day, we have yet to see any other high school player with the buzz LeBron had leading up to his NBA arrival.<br>\nLeBron didn’t disappoint in his first NBA game, finishing with a stat line of 25 points, nine assists, six rebounds and four steals in 42 minutes of play, but was defeated 106-92.<br>\nThe chase for ring No. 4 has begun. With no Kyrie Irving and the additions of Dwyane Wade, Isaiah Thomas, Derrick Rose and others, another tough journey lies ahead for King James and the Cavs, as it’s logical to assume that they have one thing on their minds: to find a way to defeat the Golden State Warriors.</p>\n<p><strong>Steph Curry: Oct. 28, 2009 – GS Warriors vs. Houston Rockets</strong><br>\nAt the core of the Warriors’ dethronement of the King and co. in two of the last three NBA Finals series is Stephen Curry. It’s no question that Curry is the greatest shooter of all time. From breaking the NBA’s single-game record of three-pointers made with 13 last season to surpassing the NBA’s single-season record for three-pointers made a total of three times, in addition to becoming the only player to ever make 300 and 400-plus threes in a season, Curry’s numbers need no explanation.<br>\nKnown for his sharpshooter ability at Davidson College, Curry’s first NBA game was a convincing performance. It was an efficient game by Curry, as he went 7-of-12 from the field to score 14 points, dished out seven assists and snagged four steals in a narrow 108-107 loss. Most surprisingly, he went 0-1 from beyond the arc. Aren’t we grateful that the world of analytics wasn’t as prevalent then as it is today? Boy, would they have been proven wrong.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Giannis Antetokounmpo: Oct. 30, 2013 – Milwaukee Bucks vs. NY Knicks</strong><br>\nThe youngest player of the 2013 NBA Draft, the then 18-year-old Giannis Antetokounmpo was a mystery for most coming out of the Greek professional basketball club Filathlitikos.<br>\nHis body and build showed signs of a stretch forward who had the length yet lacked the bulk. Uncertainty loomed even more after Antetokounmpo played just 4:43 minutes and scored one point from the free-throw line with no shot attempts in his NBA debut, which concluded with a 90-83 defeat.<br>\nBut that performance wasn’t the end of the tale for Antetokounmpo.<br>\nIt was the start of a star whom we all know as “The Greek Freak.”<br>\n“The Greek Freak, I think, is a force. I’ve never seen anything like him. His ceiling is probably … he could end up being the best player to ever play if he really wanted to. That’s pretty scary to think about. He’s by far my most favorite player to watch.”<br>\nThose are the words of Golden State’s Kevin Durant, who made such claims in a video on his YouTube channel.<br>\nThey’re words that were earned, as Antetokounmpo is coming off his best career year after becoming a first-time NBA All-Star and the first player ever to finish a regular season in the top 20 in all major stats (points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks).<br>\nKD is right; Antetokounmpo’s ceiling has no limits at the ripe, pre-prime age of 22. Who knows, the Greek Freak just might fulfill Kobe Bryant’s challenge of winning the NBA MVP award.</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Durant: Oct. 31, 2007 – Seattle Supersonics vs. Denver Nuggets</strong><br>\nThe first glimpse into the current wave of stretch forwards begins with Kevin Durant. While the impact of length had been witnessed with legends like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain, and the ability to handle the ball with craft was displayed by players such Earvin “Magic” Johnson and Allen Iverson, Durant introduced an unorthodox skillset — a near seven-foot stature with the ability to do it all on the court.<br>\nRight out the gates in his first career game, the then 19-year-old was looking to make an immediate impact as he ended with 22 shot attempts. He finished with 18 points with seven made field goals, five rebounds, three steals and a block in a 120-103 loss to a Denver team that had both Carmelo Anthony and Allen Iverson record a combined 57 points.<br>\nThe current state of KD’s career is at its full peak after his decision to join the Golden State Warriors last offseason. Despite the critics, Durant is now an NBA champion and NBA Finals MVP and has convinced many that he is the league’s best player.</p>\n<p><strong>James Harden: Oct. 28, 2009 – OKC Thunder vs. Sacramento Kings</strong><br>\nWhether it be from long range or a quick hesi-eurostep, Harden is one the NBA’s most lethal offensive players.<br>\nUpon entering the league, he was drafted into one of the best situations possible with his teammates being Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant.<br>\nHow Harden would fit within that puzzle was a concern.<br>\nBefore becoming the star player we know today as “The Beard,” his growth began with his transition to the pros.<br>\nIt was a slow start for Harden, whose playing time was capped at 13 minutes and included five points on 2-of-2 shooting, 1-of-1 from behind the three-point line and two rebounds in a 102-89 win.<br>\nSince joining the Houston Rockets, Harden has become one of the NBA’s ultimate stars and is coming off a year during which he averaged 29.1 points, 11.2 assists and 8.1 rebounds per game — all career highs.<br>\nClaims that Harden has been snubbed twice for the NBA MVP award still ring, but after helping lead the Rockets to their 122-121 win over the Warriors, he and Houston could possibly be a true contender in the West.</p>\n<p><strong>Kawhi Leonard: Dec. 26, 2011 – SA Spurs vs. Memphis Grizzlies</strong><br>\nThe late start was a result of the 2011 NBA lockout that took place. Most notably, the Indiana Pacers must regret trading Kawhi Leonard to the Spurs.<br>\nOverlooked in his draft class due to questions surrounding his offensive potential, Leonard turned out to be the biggest steal of the draft and is now within the conversation of being the game’s next best player.<br>\nSimilar to some others on this list, his first game didn’t make a profound statement.<br>\nComing off the bench in the Spurs’ 95-82 defeat of Memphis, Leonard concluded his debut with six points on 2-of-9 shooting along with six rebounds, two steals and an assist.<br>\nA reserved, humble spirit who lets his play do all the talking, Leonard remained low on many fans’ and experts’ radars until his emergence in the 2014 NBA Finals. He ended the championship series averaging 17.8 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game to win the NBA Finals MVP award.<br>\nHis postseason performance was the birth of a star, as he went on to embrace a bigger role for the Spurs and is now the team’s No. 1 option after putting up a career-high scoring average of 25.5 PPG last season.<br>\nIn spite of being ruled out of the Spurs’ Wednesday season opener, “The Klaw” seems to be on a path to greatness as he prepares for another year as San Antonio’s leading man.</p>\n<p><strong>Russell Westbrook: Oct. 29, 2008 – OKC Thunder vs. Milwaukee Bucks</strong><br>\nSince day one, Westbrook has been known for his relentless, Looney Tunes “Tasmanian Devil” motor. His first full season without KD left many favoring the likelihood of the Thunder plummeting to the bottom half of the Western Conference.<br>\nRather than sink, Westbrook made history and won the NBA MVP award after breaking NBA legend Oscar Robertson’s single-season triple double-record of 41 by finishing last season with 42 and becoming the first player since Robertson to average a triple-double (31.6 PPG, 10.4 APG, 10.7 RPG).<br>\nRewinding back to the first game of his rookie year, he had 13 points, four assists, four rebounds and one block in a 98-87 loss.<br>\nWestbrook can produce for a team on his own, but he did need more help. That help has arrived with OKC’s additions of stars Paul George and Carmelo Anthony.</p>\n<p><strong>Anthony Davis: Oct. 31, 2012 – New Orleans Hornets vs. SA Spurs</strong><br>\nThe process of being drafted by a rebuilding franchise has been a long, challenging journey for Anthony Davis, who has one playoff appearance under his belt.<br>\nHowever, “The Brow” has proven that he belongs in the NBA and showcased this in his career debut.<br>\nHe made the most of his 29 minutes, having tallied 21 points on a 6-of-12 shooting performance all while collecting seven rebounds, one steal and one block apiece, but the team still lost 99-95.</p>\n<p><strong>Damian Lillard: Oct. 31, 2012 – Portland Trailblazers vs. LA Lakers</strong><br>\nComing out of Weber State, Damian Lillard has and still does rock a chip on his shoulder as he embraces the underdog role of being underrated throughout his career.<br>\nHe and the Trailblazers hosted the Lakers, who at the time had Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Dwight Howard and Steve Nash on their team.<br>\nDame showed no fear and managed to overcome six turnovers as he broke out for a night that consisted of scoring 23 points, 11 assists, three rebounds and one steal. His strong performance helped lead Portland to a 116-106 victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Kyrie Irving: Dec. 26, 2011 – Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Toronto Raptors</strong><br>\nFollowing “The Decision” of LeBron James to leave Cleveland for the Miami Heat, the Cavaliers were in search of their next superstar.<br>\nWith the No. 1 pick in the 2011 NBA Draft, Kyrie Irving was the team’s selection to be the face of its franchise.<br>\nThe pressure may have gotten to Irving in his debut as he finished with six points on 2-of-12 shooting, seven assists, three rebounds and one steal in the Cavs’ 104-96 loss.<br>\nJames’s return in 2014 led to the pairing of him and Irving, which resulted in their success of winning one NBA title in three years of playing with each other prior to Irving having his trade request granted this past summer, landing him in Boston.<br>\nTuesday night was just the beginning of the “Uncle Drew-King James” saga that will continue to build hype as the season progresses.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Oct. 19, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79181\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blast-from-the-past-rookie-flashbacks-of-todays-nba-stars/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79181\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blast-from-the-past-rookie-flashbacks-of-todays-nba-stars/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blast-from-the-past-rookie-flashbacks-of-todays-nba-stars/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blast-from-the-past-rookie-flashbacks-of-todays-nba-stars/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blast-from-the-past-rookie-flashbacks-of-todays-nba-stars/","id":1881,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1880,1879,1878],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
