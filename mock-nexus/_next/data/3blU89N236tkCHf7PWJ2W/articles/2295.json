class=\"wp-caption-text\">As previously <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/historic-el-centro-building-set-to-reopen/\">reported</a> in Jan. 2017, occupants of the building received a 45-day eviction notice for the demolition of the building due to structural issues, including insect infestation, poor ventilation and structural damage that made the building highly unstable in the event of an earthquake.<em> Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Last Saturday — after nearly a year of fighting against the demolition of the building — students, community members and UCSB staff and faculty came together for the reopening of the renovated El Centro Arnulfo Casillas building.</p>\n<p>The open house celebration started with a ceremonial song and blessing by Chumash elder Marcus Lopez.</p>\n<p>“This center is to celebrate the new vision of the world that we are going to live in,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>He said the reopening shows that “tradition can break the master narrative” of historical colonial power over people of color and that the students, community and everyone involved in El Centro will redefine what the new narrative is.</p>\n<p>“I’m happy to see and to be here and to give you that message through these ancient songs,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>In commemorating the students for their work in saving El Centro, Lopez said “this is your strong hold, make it wise, make your connections with what you need to connect.”</p>\n<p>As previously <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/historic-el-centro-building-set-to-reopen/\">reported</a> in Jan. 2017, occupants of the building received a 45-day eviction notice for the demolition of the building due to structural issues, including insect infestation, poor ventilation and structural damage that made the building highly unstable in the event of an earthquake.</p>\n<p>After the eviction notice, students and alumni voiced their frustration toward the administration and continually fought for the permanency and improvement of the building, according to Shahryar Mooraj, a member of the El Centro committee and fourth-year mathematical science and physics double major.</p>\n<p>“As students, we came together to stop that and to fight for the history and the culture that has been built in that space over time and to ensure that El Centro has a permanent physical space on campus,” Mooraj said.</p>\n<p>“Keeping the doors open for those yet to come,” is written on the sign hanging over the front door entrance.</p>\n<p>The reopening ceremony commemorated past and present students and faculty that have fought for the fruition and continuation of El Centro through decades of social justice work, community resistance and grassroots organizing so future students of color can feel they have a space at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I was one of the students who lead the negotiation for the rebuilding process in the El Centro committee,” UCSB alumna Damaris Adame said.</p>\n<p>Adame said the day they were served the eviction which “essentially condemned” and made “immediate evacuation” necessary on Jan. 9, 2017, feels like “decades ago [rather] than just last year.” But it was last year when we as students were told that the temporary building 406 was essentially condemned and our immediate evacuation was necessary,” Adame said.</p>\n<p>According to Adame, they were asked to “remove the art, the decades of posters, murals and designs” that mark student protests and struggles that were born and grew out of El Centro, but they were also asked to abandon “the safety [they] had created within these four walls.”</p>\n<p>Adame said that the students El Centro carry with them, the Chicanx movement of MEChA, the hunger strikes of 1988 and 1994, and more movements uplifted them.</p>\n<p>Congressman and UCSB alumnus Salud Carbajal and Chancellor Henry T. Yang were present at the ceremony along with Ozzie Vargas, director of the Educational Opportunity Program and representatives from Counseling and Psychological Services. Many Chicano/a studies department faculty and Associated Students (A.S.) officials were also present.</p>\n<p>Event organizer, Yaneli Gutierrez, distinguished A.S. executive director, Marisela Marquez as a staff member that has been a supporter of El Centro since her time as a graduate student on campus.</p>\n<p>Marquez told the story of the day she first visited El Centro in 1988. She said “it was the first time I had exhaled in three years.”</p>\n<p>“In the early years, I watched [students] negotiate and sell M&amp;M’s to actually create the first La Raza college day,” Marquez said, referring to when El Congreso, one of El Centro’s organizations, brings high school and middle school students of color to campus to introduce them to how higher education works.</p>\n<p>Marquez said the Chicanx and Latinx student population has gone from approximately 12 percent to over 25 percent and credited El Centro as a main reason for UCSB’s effectiveness as a Hispanic Serving Institution.</p>\n<p>Marquez emphasized that past and present generations of students have created a space where future students will retain what El Centro has to offer.</p>\n<p>“Without [the students’ work] we wouldn’t be standing here. Its known that the next generation of students are right behind you and they’re taking it to heart,” Marquez said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the April 19 print edition

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Sophia Dycaico has been involved in the community since her freshman year, working as a community coordinator for the then-external vice president of local affairs, taking an active role campaigning for local self-governance efforts and being a serviceable helping hand to campus organizations as a student senator.</p>\n<p>If Dycaico can focus her organizing efforts on finding real-world solutions to the numerous problems affecting I.V., including safety and police presence, then her experience and knowledge of the community’s history will make her an effective EVPLA next year.</p>\n<p>The EVPLA is the executive A.S. representative for all things Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>As a first-year history of public policy major, Dycaico helped Third District Supervisor candidate Joan Hartmann register voters in the community. In the spring, she worked as the Community Services District (CSD) coordinator for the EVPLA office, months before the CSD became a reality.</p>\n<p>Dycaico spent that fall going door to door, asking people to vote on measures that would create both the district and a tax to fund it. She helped host a forum, held by the EVPLA office, featuring CSD Board of Directors candidates. Many of those candidates ended up on the board, but the CSD didn’t get its funding. This June, it will have another chance, and Dycaico is again campaigning for it.</p>\n<p>Since then, Dycaico has hunkered down on campus efforts. She was elected off-campus senator last spring. During her term, she is most proud of having been an effective liaison between the Senate and organizations like Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) and UCSB Lobby Corps.</p>\n<p>Rena Bahl, EAB co-chair, agreed Dycaico was a viable liaison who attended 75 percent of the org’s meetings — more than she was required to by A.S. legal code.</p>\n<p>“She did a lot more than she was supposed to and put in way more effort than previous liaisons,” said Bahl, a third-year environmental studies and global studies major.</p>\n<p>During her <em>Nexus</em> endorsement interview, Dycaico proved she has a solid level of background knowledge of I.V.’s workings. She’s aware of current CSD projects and other I.V. fixtures like the Beloved Community conference and the I.V. Recreation and Parks District. Dycaico has formed opinions on tenant-landlord mediation and making Halloween safer.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Dycaico’s ideas for improving I.V. could use further work. Combatting I.V.’s burglary rates, she said, starts with giving its residents more replacement keys for their houses because too many are leaving their homes unlocked.</p>\n<p>Dycaico’s plan fails to consider that The Home Depot is only a 13-minute bicycle ride away from the southernmost block of I.V.</p>\n<p>Dycaico also introduced nothing new when it comes to engaging I.V.’s non-student population, including families and residents who do not speak English as a first language.</p>\n<p>Still, when it comes to understanding the projects already underway in I.V. and the bureaucratic tangles that may slow them down, Dycaico is the right candidate for the job. If she can get to know more of the folks in the community this summer and commit herself to understanding how they would like to be helped, Dycaico would do a fair job of representing the student population in I.V.</p>\n<p>Students can vote for Dycaico in the A.S. Elections by logging on to G.O.L.D. from April 23-26.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 19 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

His plan for a fiscal accountability task force would reallocate unused student funds for projects within A.S. and, if Dumlao follows through, could help ensure students’ money is not wasted.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> is also interested in Dumlao’s idea to reform UCSB students’ healthcare.</p>\n<p>Dumlao wants Student Health to accept all major insurance providers, as he said the service currently only accepts Gaucho Health Insurance. Through Dumlao’s plan to incorporate UCSB into the UC Health system, more students will have access to Student Health services, regardless of their insurance plan.</p>\n<p>While Dumlao is an advocate for empowering student voices within the association and has long-term goals like healthcare reform, the candidate also understands the day-to-day lives of students on campus.</p>\n<p>Dumlao’s proposal to create community study spaces in the library would provide a location for students of shared majors to study and communicate, which he said will facilitate more dialogue among the student body.</p>\n<p>While vague in its implementation, Dumlao’s eagerness to create small- and large-scale change on campus is admirable in a presidential candidate, especially with a term limited to a school year.</p>\n<p>Brooke Kopel, Dumlao’s opponent running with Campus United, is qualified for the job of president with her experience as an L&amp;S senator and an apparent dedication to equality for students.</p>\n<p>Yet Kopel’s primary concrete plan for a natural disaster relief program, while well-intentioned in its structure, does not compare with Dumlao’s presentation of multiple feasible ideas and projects.</p>\n<p>Dumlao should also remember to carry himself with the dignity of his position, as his conduct in opposing ideas he disagrees with has a strong possibility of causing rifts within the organization.</p>\n<p>Dumlao has ambitious goals and a series of plans for tangible projects, but the <em>Nexus</em> would like to remind the candidate to remain inclusive of all perspectives as the leader of the student body.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 19 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

Tamari Dzotsenidze / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Morales’s platform includes addressing the rising costs of higher education, increasing outreach to students and uplifting groups in the community who may feel they lack representation.</p>\n<p>To address college affordability, Morales has served as the legislative outreach director for the Coalition for For a Better UC and has worked on Assembly Bill 3153, which would extend the Cal Grant through the summer sessions.</p>\n<p>She said she has also worked with Monique Limon to address food insecurity on college campuses.</p>\n<p>Morales takes a refreshing approach to resources for students and affordability and is focused on including students that do not qualify for benefits or come from out of state.</p>\n<p>“Not all students are eligible for these kinds of programs including out-of-state and undocumented students, and yet we are still required to pay these student fees,” she said.</p>\n<p>Morales has experience working with Lobby Corps and arranging lobbying trips though she does not address the issues with lobbying, such as a lack of preparation and the effectiveness of the trips, like her opponent Madeline Loudon.</p>\n<p>According to the Associated Students legal code, the purpose of the external vice president for statewide affairs (EVPSA) is to “serve as the official representative” of A.S. to the University of California Students’ Association (UCSA) Board of Directors as well as the United States Students’ Association (USSA).”</p>\n<p>Morales has served within USSA, giving her experience as a representative of the university, specifically within marginalized groups.</p>\n<p>While both Morales and her opponent have acknowledged their respective privileges and emphasized the importance of letting marginalized groups speak for themselves, Morales specifically addressed anti-blackness within the USSA and the UCSA.</p>\n<p>“I know what is good about [USSA] and I know what is bad, one of those things we have to work on in both spaces is getting rid of the anti-blackness that a lot of students have faced,” Morales told the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Her experience working with El Congreso and in the Student Activist Network gives her a more diverse background, and the <em>Nexus </em>believes that her many ties to student groups on campus will allow for increased outreach and mobilization.</p>\n<p>It is her conviction and breadth of experience that make her the best candidate for EVPSA.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the April 19 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
