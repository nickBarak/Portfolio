In a place like California, it’s hard to see it any other way.</p>\n<p>It’s June 2, 2010. I’m eating dinner with my girlfriend in Goleta while the Blackhawks play the Flyers in Game 3 of the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals. I check the score on my phone. It’s 2-2. There are two big screen TVs in the restaurant: one tuned to SportsCenter, the other to ESPNews. I ask the bartender if he can turn on the hockey game. “Sure, chief. No problem.”</p>\n<p>Ten minutes later I’m still watching ESPNews. Again, I go up to ask him to change it. He’s annoyed. He’s annoyed? I do the best I can to keep my cool, but it’s the Stanley Cup fucking Finals. He begrudgingly grabs the remote.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The championship series of one of the world’s major sports can’t get play over early-season baseball highlights. That’s Santa Barbara’s relationship with hockey in a nutshell. The bartender changed the channel to the NHL network — a repeat of a Bruins game from two years ago. But he can’t tell the difference.</p>\n<p>Hockey’s not a sport that translates well to a small screen. The camera follows the puck so your eyes follow the puck, but the overall picture is much more crucial. Hockey’s about momentum: It’s easier to understand if you can see the entire ice surface at once.</p>\n<p>Make your way across the border to Canada and you’ll notice that hockey’s prominence in the media equals America’s big three sports. If you live in Toronto and you’re not a Maple Leafs fan, people question why. If you live in Toronto and root for the Senators, you have thousands of enemies.</p>\n<p>Forsaking the sport completely in Canada is akin to living in Hollywood and not enjoying film. It just doesn’t make sense.</p>\n<p>Even in American hockey “hotbeds” like Boston and Minnesota, the hockey teams take a backseat to the Red Sox, the Patriots and the Celtics, the Twins and the Vikings.  The state of hockey is even more dire in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>If you want to understand hockey and keep up with the happenings of the sport in America (particularly on the West Coast) you really have to dig.</p>\n<p>The sport is a chain of ebbs and flows that demands sustained effort. Success is built step by step and requires intense precision. A team can’t score without getting the puck into the zone, which can’t happen without an individual effort to get the puck up the ice or to place an accurate pass through bodies and skates, which can’t happen without first getting the puck out of their zone and so on.</p>\n<p>All of these actions take place at high speed, on ice, on skates, with players the size of linebackers interrupting the puck carrier with body checks.</p>\n<p>Think of scoring a goal like climbing a ladder while getting attacked by bees. Then you’ll see that poise in the face of pressure is prized above all else.</p>\n<p>These are the kinds of things I wish someone would have explained to that bartender in Goleta. Rather than having to go back to the bar a third time, the game would have been on from the moment I walked in the door. I’d be discussing the Blackhawks’ breakout patterns and the Flyers’ goalie Michael Leighton and his poor positioning, with other hockey fans at the bar.</p>\n<p>Yet, when I write that faux-retrospective fantasy in a Santa Barbara state of mind, it seems ridiculous. I can count on both hands the people I know from around here with whom I would be able to have that kind of conversation.</p>\n<p>I love hockey. I want everyone to love hockey. Goddamn it, if I have to explain the sport on a fundamental level and build it from the ground up to get people interested, then that’s what I’ll do. It’s not just that I want more friends to talk hockey with, I think everyone deserves to at least have an understanding of the sport and give it a fair shake.</p>\n<p>People never give hockey a chance. The next time you’re flipping through channels and you come across a hockey game, stop, and even if you don’t completely understand what’s going on. If you find yourself confused, that’s OK. But if you find yourself intrigued, pursue that interest. It’s a beautiful sport, the greatest there is: I’m still impressed every day by the unpredictability and the endless possibilities of what 12 players on ice with sticks and a puck can do. Learn it and enjoy it. I promise you won’t regret it.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

all the work that came with it lived up to her expectations.</p>\n<p>“I felt like I had a lot of insight coming into office … I made sure I knew what I was getting myself into,” she said.</p>\n<p>Her position as UC Santa Barbara’s external vice president for statewide affairs (EVPSA) required her to advocate on behalf of the student body to the University of California Regents, UC Office of the President and other partner organizations with Associated Students (A.S.).</p>\n<p>Hsu told the <em>Nexus</em> she believes she successfully addressed all of her campaign platforms during her year in office.</p>\n<p>She ran on a platform of advocating to legislators for the “rights, resources, and representation of students across the state and nation.”</p>\n<p>During her time as EVPSA, Hsu focused on preventing a tuition increase for the 2018-2019 school year that the UC Regents were planning to impose in response to the lack of state funding.</p>\n<p>Hsu went on a number of advocacy trips throughout the year to advocate on behalf of UCSB students to encourage the UC Regents to listen to student needs including advocating for bills regarding sexual assault, violence and harassment on campus.</p>\n<p>Because of the work Hsu and other student advocates have been doing to prevent this increase, the Regents <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-29/uc-regents-postpone-vote-on-tuition-hike/\">postponed the vote</a> to raise in-state tuition until the end of May and have instead begun partnering with students to advocate for more funding from the state, Hsu said.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Hsu, along with UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang, A.S. President Hieu Le and other university members went to Sacramento to meet with legislators and lobby for “budget asks and what [A.S.] determines to be priorities.”</p>\n<p>The group asked legislators for $140 million to address “deferred maintenance, over enrollment [for the 2017-18 school year] and buying out the tuition increase.”</p>\n<p>The latter was in response to Governor Brown’s proposed budget for the UC, which was significantly less than the Regents expected.</p>\n<p>The results of their efforts will be seen in June when the legislators create a budget for the UC and submit it to the House and Senate.</p>\n<p>In addition to lobbying for students, Hsu promised to “advocate for the establishment of a campus-based Middle Class Scholarship for UCSB students as a response to the elimination of the CA Middle Class Scholarship.”</p>\n<p>Initially, Brown planned to eliminate it, but later decided not to following public and legislative backlash.</p>\n<p>Since the scholarship was never eliminated a replacement was not necessary to implement, Hsu said.</p>\n<p>Hsu also fulfilled her goal of bringing all candidates running for California Governor to UCSB to speak with students.</p>\n<p>Governor Candidate Delaine Eastin visited UCSB on Earth Day, Antonio Villaraigosa will be visiting in a few weeks, and both John Chiang and Gavin Newsom are planning to visit before the June 5 primaries, according to Hsu.</p>\n<p>Hsu’s final platform item stated she would “collaborate with key state and student organizers to work on a system-wide campaign to reclaim the cost of higher education during the 2018 election.” Hsu said she has worked with Reclaim California’s Higher Education Coalition throughout the school year to create an informational video, released in October, that explains how people of all backgrounds can achieve higher education.</p>\n<p>“In some shape or form I have responded to all my platorm points,” Hsu said.</p>\n<p>Hsu said she is most proud of helping unite students voices at UCSB with state legislators who can make changes to the higher education system, specifically in regards to their fight for increased budgets.</p>\n<p>“It’s always been a struggle of whether these powers or institutions or higher authorities will take students seriously,” she said. “I think this year the work that UCSB students have done really shows that we are a force to be reckoned with.”</p>\n<p>Hsu said the money the EVPSA’s office received for the 2017-2018 school year went to funding their advocacy trips and events the office hosted throughout the year, including the GOP tax panel last fall, which featured Congressman Salud Carbajal.</p>\n<p>“This panel was set to inform people about how [the GOP tax] would affect both undergraduate and graduate students alike,” she said.</p>\n<p>Hsu also partnered with Rose Le, the EVPSA office’s mental health coordinator, to organize a panel for the science, technology, engineering and mathematics students on campus to aid them in maintaining their mental health amidst the stresses of their heavy class load.</p>\n<p>Nushi Yapabandara, the Re-Ignite coordinator for EVPSA, praised Hsu and the rest of the team for the work they were able to accomplish this year.</p>\n<p>“[The EVPSA is] one of the most productive A.S. exec offices and I am going to miss being able to work with such down-to-earth people in the ‘real world,’” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>Yapabandara and Hsu partnered together to work on projects including the establishment of permIGNITE, an organization on campus that works to “empower the marginalized voices that proudly exist within the UC campuses and beyond,” according to the EVPSA’s Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Hsu said the biggest challenge that both she and her team faced over the year was time.</p>\n<p>“Everyone else works on this regular calendar year January through December, but student leaders work May to May which is odd,” she said.</p>\n<p>Hsu said the unusual time differences were difficult because students live such different lives than regular government officials.</p>\n<p>Hsu’s elected successor was fourth-year global and Chicanx studies double major Mayela Morales, who was later <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualified from her position</a> by A.S. Elections Board on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>As she transitions out of her position, Hsu wants the student body to know about all the hard work that both she and the rest of A.S. do throughout the year.</p>\n<p>“A.S. is really a space for students to be their own advocates and … to feel empowered on the issues that they care about,” Hsu said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the May 17, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83141\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83141\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/","id":2268,"author":{"id":88,"name":"Katie Wolf"},"related":[2267,2266,2265],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"AFSCME Strike Comes to an End, A.S.

Yang to state his support for the union to the University of California Office of the President (UCOP).</p>\n<p>“I authored the resolution because I have high respect for our custodial/maintenance workers here on campus,” Gessesse said. “By cc’ing Chancellor Yang, we want direct action, a statement that shows his support for the workers on campus to the Regents, UCOP and other agencies written on that resolution. I believe it’s pertinent to this movement.”</p>\n<p>“This strike should not be overlooked,” she added.</p>\n<p>American Federation of State, County &amp; Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299’s three-day strike at UCSB began on Monday morning and ended Wednesday evening, going from approximately 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day.</p>\n<p>More than 200 workers and student supporters <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-07/afscme-begins-strike-draws-over-200-supporters-at-ucsb/\">marched around campus</a> several times throughout the day, chanting and holding dozens of handmade signs.</p>\n<p>This is the largest strike in the history of the UC, according to an AFSCME press release on Wednesday morning.</p>\n<p>The Senate resolution was student-sponsored by Michael Kile, fifth-year chemistry major and AFSCME intern.</p>\n<p>“With community comes empathy, and with empathy comes action,” Kile said during an A.S. Senate meeting Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>The resolution references data from a report AFSCME 3299 released in mid-April, which states that black and Latinx employees are making starting wages that are 20 to 21 percent less than their white counterparts.</p>\n<p>AFSCME <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/union-votes-to-strike-following-final-impasse/\">voted to strike</a> following more than a year of negotiations with the UC. Currently the union represents over 24,000 workers, according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>“UC workers are going on strike to fight for their right for dignity and respect in the workplace in which negotiations for their right to sanctuary campuses, fair hiring practices, and an ending to contract practices that push womxn and people of color, especially into inescapable low wage jobs,” the resolution reads.</p>\n<p>UCOP released a statement Monday morning when the strike began, calling the strike “ill-advised” and “highly inappropriate.”</p>\n<p>“AFSCME leaders are demanding a nearly 20 percent pay raise over three years — twice what other UC employees have received. The university cannot justify to taxpayers such an excessive raise, no matter how much we appreciate our service workers,” UCOP’s press release states.</p>\n<p>“A disruptive demonstration will change neither UC’s economic situation nor the university’s position on AFSCME’s unreasonable demands,” the press release reads.</p>\n<p>As of Wednesday night, the university has not sent out a statement addressing the end of the strike.</p>\n<p>“[The A.S.
