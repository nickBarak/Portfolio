Synthetic drugs mimic the effects of illegal substances and have slightly altered chemical structures, which tend to be more powerful and unpredictable than non-synthetic substances. They can cause excited delirium, anxiety and paranoia which can lead to violent aggression and self-injury. The risks of using these drugs include seizures, heart attacks and death.</p>\n<p>Alcohol and Drug Program Director Jackie Kurta said users of synthetic drugs are looking for effects similar to LSD but have much more severe experiences.</p>\n<p>“The kind of trips students are expecting to take when they take LSD is not the kind of response they are getting from the substances,” Kurta said.</p>\n<p>Kurta said N-Bomb, Flakka and bath salts are the most common synthetic drugs students have reportedly been attaining.</p>\n<p>“These substances are not pure LSD, but they are chemically combined substances which result in unpredictable self-harm, unexpected psychotic unexplainable behavior,” Kurta said. “We know that it’s out there and that it’s very available.”</p>\n<p>According to Department of Psychological and Brain Studies professor Karen Szumlinski, bath salts are synthetic derivatives of cathinone, an active stimulant prohibited in some states and banned in some countries. Szumlinski said it blocks re-uptake of dopamine and serotonin, causing pleasurable effects, and blocks norepinephrine receptors, increasing the user’s heart rate.</p>\n<p>“Bath salts are a generic name for a composite of all sorts of different chemicals,” Szumlinski said. “With bath salts, because they’re more amphetamine-like, you will have more delusions of issues that are related to your illegal drug activity.”</p>\n<p>Szumlinski said the cathinone derivatives are also found in spice, Flakka and K-2 synthetic marijuana that can cause psychosis. According to Szumlinski, Flakka has the effects of hallucinogens and amphetamines and can cause aggressive behavior.</p>\n<p>“Flakka blows my mind and is frightening,” Szumlinski said. “Flakka is LSD-like and actually activates the same receptors that LSD activates, the serotonin 2A receptors.”</p>\n<p>Szumlinski said N-Bomb is similar to LSD in that it also activates the serotonin 2A receptor that LSD activates, and it is not a safer alternative.</p>\n<p>“The effects are shorter than LSD,” Szumlinski said. “In terms of it being safer than LSD, the answer is not at all.”</p>\n<p>An anonymous first-year biochemistry major who is a repeat user of LSD and a one-time user of N-Bomb said while both drugs are euphoric, a LSD trip can be described as more of a “central experience” while N-Bomb is more of a “chaotic” party drug.</p>\n<p>“With N-Bomb you have more visual effects, and LSD has more mental and psychological effects,” the student said.</p>\n<p>The student said they chose to consume the synthetic drug out of curiosity, but did not have a positive experience.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t have a good time with it, and I’d rather just stick with actual LSD,” the student said.</p>\n<p>The students also said for many users of N-Bomb, “you don’t know what you’re getting into.”</p>\n<p>“If you don’t know it’s N-Bomb, you can get a bad trip,” the student said. “It’s kind of like weed in a way, you laugh a lot, at random shit, and the visuals are much more than LSD.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) Sergeant Daniel Calderon said synthetic drug use is “everywhere.”</p>\n<p>“It’s throughout California, it’s throughout the states, it’s a worldwide problem. There has been an increase in synthetic-type drug use, but that’s globally across the board, it’s not just in Isla Vista,” Calderon said. “I believe that people sometimes think it’s safer because they are synthetic and/or man-made.”</p>\n<p>Calderon said IVFP receives medical calls for synthetic drug users displaying erratic behavior or psychological episodes. According to Calderon, these subjects often “can’t comprehend logical thought” and do not want care from emergency response.</p>\n<p>“They’re in such a delusional state that they’ll actually try to fight against the medics,” Calderon said. “Any type of drug can be dangerous because you don’t know how your body is going to react.”</p>\n<p>IVFP Deputy Simon Trujillo said the use and possession of these drugs is not prohibited, but the sale to minors is illegal in some areas.</p>\n<p>“The main problem with them is there are many combinations, there’s many different chemical compositions … there is no uniform way to control how they are produced. Their effects are often unpredictable,” Trujillo said. “If a user were to use them multiple times they may get a different reaction or a different experience each time they use them.”</p>\n<p>Calderon said part of the appeal of synthetic drugs is that they are an alternative to traditional street drugs, and that they can be marketed and distributed in packaging similar to candy wrappers.</p>\n<p>Calderon said in medical emergencies involving drugs, it is best to seek help and notify the authorities of information that can aid responders in helping intoxicated persons.</p>\n<p>“They’re not going to get in trouble and it’s better to call,” Calderon said. “They’re protected by law against any prosecution in a medical emergency.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66539\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-17/increased-usage-of-lsd-like-synthetic-drugs-identified-in-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66539\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-17/increased-usage-of-lsd-like-synthetic-drugs-identified-in-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-17/increased-usage-of-lsd-like-synthetic-drugs-identified-in-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-17/increased-usage-of-lsd-like-synthetic-drugs-identified-in-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-17/increased-usage-of-lsd-like-synthetic-drugs-identified-in-i-v/","id":2607,"author":{"id":138,"name":"Selina Alvarez"},"related":[2606,2605,2604],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":138,"name":"Selina Alvarez","biography":"Not available","articles":[2600,2607,2631,2666,2674],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Study Shows Increase in Students Receiving Mental Health Treatment","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-new-logo.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-new-logo.png?resize=512%2C512&ssl=1","description":"A recent RAND Corporation study found that more University of California students have been receiving mental health care following an increase in state funding for mental health services on campuses.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A recent RAND Corporation study found that more University of California students have been receiving mental health care following an increase in state funding for mental health services on campuses.</p>\n<p>California Mental Health Services Authority (CalMHSA), a statewide mental health initiative funded by the 2004 Mental Health Services Act (Prop. 63), implemented new mental health service programs at California’s public colleges in 2010, asking the Santa Monica-based think tank RAND Corporation to conduct an evaluation of the statewide programs over the course of a year. The RAND report indicates the percentage of students accessing mental health treatment increased by about 13 percent from 2013 to 2014. UCSB’s Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) confirms an increase in the number of students it has been treating since receiving CalMHSA funding in 2011.</p>\n<p>RAND Corporation associate policy researcher and lead author of the study J. Scott Ashwood said the increase indicates more students are going to counseling services to receive necessary help.</p>\n<p>“A lot of students at UCs and other systems experience mental health disorders, and it’s also the case that most of those students don’t receive services or treatment for those mental health disorders,” Ashwood said. “We think an increase of 13 percent is a really positive increase because it means that more students are getting treatment for these conditions that they weren’t getting treatment for before.”</p>\n<p>Ashwood said there could be more than one reason campuses treated more students between 2013 and 2014 than in previous years, such as an increase in the amount of insured students due to the Affordable Care Act, but he believes CalMHSA funding for campus mental health services is the primary reason for the increase.</p>\n<p>“We’re pretty confident that some of this increase, at least — and possibly all of it — is due to CalMHSA’s investment,” Ashwood said.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. director Jeanne Stanford said UCSB’s mental health services center has seen a 20 percent increase in the amount of students it serves every year since it first received CalMHSA grant funding in 2011.</p>\n<p>“I never knew what money would do for mental health services until we got the grant,” Stanford said. “It made us visible and it made mental health visible. None of that, or maybe a quarter of that, would have been done without the CalMHSA funds.”</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. mental health specialist Gladys Koscak, who helped decide how to spend CalMHSA grant funding, said C.A.P.S. used the state money mostly for outreach, such as the center’s #SaySomething campaign, which launched in 2012.</p>\n<p>“[The grant] gave us the opportunity to have money for outreach and marketing materials that we typically don’t have money to be able to purchase,” Koscak said. “That really helped spread the word both about our services and also about mental health in general.”</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. psychologist Janet Osimo, who also helped allocate CalMHSA grant funds, said the additional money allowed C.A.P.S. to develop a mobile phone app and an online interactive screening program alongside its #SaySomething campaign, which she said encouraged students to access C.A.P.S. over the past few years.</p>\n<p>“I think what the extra funding does for us is it really helps address the unspoken need out there that we’re not aware of so we can start opening our doors more,” Osimo said. “Fortunately, we’ve been able to continue that.”</p>\n<p>Stanford said she hopes the increase in the number of students that C.A.P.S. has treated since 2011 leads university policy makers to give even more funding for campus mental health services.</p>\n<p>“I hope it increases the allotment and that it increases what the universities are willing to give to student mental health,” Stanford said.</p>\n<p>Stanford also said she hopes to see administration designate more campus space to C.A.P.S. to meet the university’s increasing demand for mental health treatment.</p>\n<p>“You can’t just increase the numbers in the schools or build more residence halls without thinking about mental health,” Stanford said. “It’s about finding the space for mental health and wellness services on a campus and making it a policy that every campus has to increase their ability to provide services.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and sociology double major Siavash Zohoori said the RAND Corporation findings will demonstrate to the UC Board of Regents that increased funding toward campus mental health services allows universities to treat more students.</p>\n<p>“I think that the study was a necessary step that a lot of activists were waiting for so that we could prove to the Regents and the policy makers that the funding is really necessary and will be effective,” Zohoori said. “Increased funding will actually benefit students.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Not quite like Diana; she’s [swam] between countries,” Wilson said. “I’ve never met her but I have a built-in appreciation and wonder for what allows her to do these extraordinary things to the brink of human ability.”</p>\n<p>Wilson said Nyad’s commitment to perfection is essential to her accomplishments.</p>\n<p>“I endorse and completely subscribe to Diana’s philosophy of putting 100 percent into life in and out of the water,” Wilson said. “In anything a student or student athlete does, you need passion and full engagement to overcome adversity.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Marine Science Institute Director and project scientist Andrew Brooks said ocean wild life was the biggest threat to Nyad’s undertaking.</p>\n<p>“While the media plays up the shark issue, the most dangerous threat she faced were the jellyfish, and the Australian box jelly can easily be fatal,” Brooks said. “Dehydration from saltwater or simple sunburn, cramping and lack of energy would be things I automatically worry about.”<br>\nBrooks said Nyad’s long-distance swim between countries is “staggering.”</p>\n<p>“She accomplished something amazing and was able to push the limits of the human body,” Brooks said. “I think it certainly speaks to her mental ability and strength.”</p>\n<p>Third-year physical geography major Jack Sargent said that as someone who regularly surfs the California coast he appreciates Nyad’s ability to brave the elements to accomplish her goal.</p>\n<p>“Knowing the unending monotony of the ocean, I just cannot imagine that mental strain and physical strength required for over two days in the Florida straits,” Sargent said. “I’m really looking forward to hearing Diana’s story.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Nov. 12, issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66423\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/nyad-to-speak-about-record-swim-memoir/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66423\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/nyad-to-speak-about-record-swim-memoir/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/nyad-to-speak-about-record-swim-memoir/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/nyad-to-speak-about-record-swim-memoir/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/nyad-to-speak-about-record-swim-memoir/","id":2604,"author":{"id":141,"name":"Ari Plachta"},"related":[2603,2602,2601],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Autopsy Results Released in Death of UCSB Student","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image1.jpg?resize=720%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Santa Barbara County Sheriff-Coroner’s Office released new information Monday about the death of 19-year-old, second-year UCSB student Andres Sanchez in Isla Vista on Oct. 11.

The most common method of ingesting 25I-NBOMe is orally. The most prevalent street names for this drug are ‘25I’ or ‘N-Bomb.’ Although 25I-NBOMe has been around for more than 12 years, recreational abuse rates for the drug have increased dramatically in the past few years, resulting in a significant number of hospitalizations for overdoses, as well as deaths. Ingestion of 25I-NBOMe can result in seizures, aggression, self-harm and agitation, distortions in space and time, psychosis-like symptoms, an abnormally rapid heart rate, increased body temperature, and rapid breakdown of muscle tissue. Existing case reports of 25I-NBOMe abuse indicates that there is a substantial risk of toxicity after ingesting limited quantities of this hallucinogenic substance. Ketamine is an anesthetic, with hallucinogenic properties. Common street names for ketamine, include ‘K’ and ‘Vitamin K,’ among many others. Although it was developed in the early 1960’s as an anesthetic, its popularity as a recreational hallucinogenic drug has increased dramatically in the past ten years as result of its association with “rave” dances. Misuse of ketamine can result in hallucinations, delirium, irrational behavior and progress into cardiovascular and respiratory irregularities.</em></p>\n<p>Sanchez was also under the influence of marijuana at the time of his death, according to the statement.</p>\n<p>Read the full press release below:</p>\n<p style=\" margin: 12px auto 6px auto;
