DeWeese continues to be one of the bright spots in the lineup, recording a total of six clean sheets on the season.</p>\n<p>Cal State Northridge will come into this matchup with an overall record of 8-4-3. The Matadors have been extremely impressive this year behind strong play from sophomore goalkeeper Amanda Delgado. Delgado has recorded 41 saves on the year with a save percentage of 78.8%.</p>\n<p>Offensively, CSUN is led by sophomore forward Alexis White who has scored five goals on the year along with an assist.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly, on the other hand, has struggled this season as the Mustangs are 4-9-1 this year and have lost three of their last six matchups.</p>\n<p>Freshman midfielder Camille Lafaix leads the team with four goals and two assists with freshman forward Nikki Trucco coming in right behind her with two goals.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs have not been able to put it together defensively in particular this year as the team tends to fall behind early, putting them in the difficult situation of constantly trying to come from behind.</p>\n<p>In order for Santa Barbara to have success in these matchups, the Gauchos must continue to play aggressively on the defensive side of the field while avoiding fouls. Over their past three games, UCSB has found a good balance between the two which has allowed them to control the time of possession.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos have found success as of late, it will be crucial for the team to continue to rely on their fundamentals as that has helped put them over the top in their recent close games.</p>\n<p>That being said, the team must also continue to develop their offensive identity as the team has still not found their second scorer behind Murison.</p>\n<p>Even though UCSB has had success despite this fact, the team will surely need to find their second threat on the offensive side of the ball — especially with the team looking to compete for the Big West title.</p>\n<p>Although Murison has found ways to score despite double-teams and opponents keying in on her in the penalty box, a second scorer can help take some of the pressure off of her shoulders.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara seems to have found their rhythm at the perfect time as UCSB remains undefeated in conference play.</p>\n<p>Their important test coming up against CSUN will be a good indicator of where the Gauchos are against a team that is playing extremely well. If UCSB is able to make the Matadors uncomfortable in their own half, the team will have opportunities to capitalize on mistakes that could potentially lead to a transition attack.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are back in action twice this week with one game on Thursday against CSUN at 7 p.m. and the other back at home against rival Cal Poly at 1 p.m. on Sunday, where the ‘Chos will look to secure their third and fourth win in conference play.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

id=\"caption-attachment-90318\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / The Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Santa Barbara women’s soccer team will head to UC Davis this Thursday where the Gauchos will look to take on their second conference win of the season and add another win to their overall record of 5-3-3.  After an impressive win against Long Beach State, Santa Barbara seems to have found their rhythm as of late, which is an encouraging sight heading into the heart of conference play.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their most recent matchup against Long Beach State, freshman midfielder Dylan Lewis netted the only goal in the thirteenth minute of the game. Lewis played an integral part throughout the game as she had a total of three shots on goal, putting constant pressure on the 49er goalkeeper. Multiple players had shot attempts in this matchup with Shaelan Murision leading the way with four. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese continued her stellar play as she had two saves, which included a crucial save on a penalty in the second half. DeWeese has proven to be the anchor of the ‘Chos defense as she now has a total of six clean sheets thus far. With the Gauchos’ defenders constantly pressuring the opponent’s teams forwards, there have been few shots on goal which has led to DeWeese finding her comfort zone in front of the net. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Davis heads into this game on a four-game losing streak and an overall record of 5-7 including an 0-2 conference record. In their most recent matchup against UC Irvine, the Aggies took the lead in the fourth minute of the game but gave up two goals in the 10th and 34th minute. A common theme for UC Davis has been their inability to find ways to win close games as three of their last four losses have been by just a goal. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, the Aggies are extremely talented with sophomore Casey Palmer and redshirt freshman midfielder Leslie Fregoso leading the way offensively with three goals each. Defensively the squad is led by junior goalkeeper Nicki Rucki who has a total of 27 saves on the year with a save percentage of 73%. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for UCSB to have success in this matchup, it will be crucial for players to continue to emerge offensively. Lewis was a key contributor last week and will look to continue playing at a high level this upcoming Thursday. This will take pressure off of senior forward Murison and allow her to operate in the penalty box without a double team coming. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the team will need to continue to keep up their pressure on the defensive end. With consistent pressure in the middle half of the field, Santa Barbara has limited the amount of opportunities that opponents have had on goal. By remaining disciplined, this will ensure that opponents do not become comfortable or create chances on a transition attack. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the season has gone on, the ‘Chos have started to close out games rather than ending up with a tie. Much of this can be attributed to the team building their chemistry throughout the season, especially with this young of a group. It could not have come at a better time as well with conference play starting up as Santa Barbara will look to make a push for the Big West championship. With a team playing as hard as they are, surely good things will continue to happen for the talented squad. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is back in action this Thursday against UC Davis at 4 p.m. where the Gauchos will look to pick up their second win in conference play as well as their fourth win away from home. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90317\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/ucsb-womens-soccer-heads-north-to-face-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90317\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/ucsb-womens-soccer-heads-north-to-face-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/ucsb-womens-soccer-heads-north-to-face-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/ucsb-womens-soccer-heads-north-to-face-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/ucsb-womens-soccer-heads-north-to-face-uc-davis/","id":1287,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[1286,1285,1284],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 17 UCSB Men’s Soccer Ties UC Davis Aggies 1-1","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2019-10-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_5292-1.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_5292-1.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The men’s soccer postseason starts in two weeks for the Gauchos, but the team still has a pair of road games ahead of them before they can think about playoff glory.

Whether it was motivated by protecting their home field in order to earn the top spot in the Big West or determination to defeat a top-20 program in the nation in UCSB, the Aggies got off to a fiery start as they peppered the Gauchos’ goal with plenty of shots early on in the match. So much so that junior defender Hunter Ashworth already saw yellow by the seventh minute of play and was the first of four Gauchos that would go on to be booked by the referee.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It wasn’t until minute 13 that the Gauchos found their first chance of the game off a corner kick by junior forward Ameyawu Muntari. Unfortunately, senior midfielder Thibault Candia, who has been brilliant for the Gauchos all season, picked up a knock and freshman midfielder Finn Ballard McBride came on for the injured Gaucho. Following this sequence, UCSB slowly began to find their rhythm, but UC Davis kept their shots flooding in as the first half went on.</p>\n<p>Then, by the 38th minute, a corner kick for the Aggies set up the match’s first score as a crowded penalty area triggered a Gaucho own goal.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the Aggies’ celebrations of going one up had gone to their heads, as it literally took a matter of seconds for UCSB to respond. And respond they did, as the Gauchos seemingly went straight for the host’s goal from kickoff.</p>\n<p>The equalizing goal was set up off a shot from senior forward Will Baynham. Baynham’s initial shot was saved by Aggie goalkeeper Wallis Lapsley, but the ball rebounded off his gloves and took a favorable roll for the visitors as it met Ballard McBride’s boot before meeting the back of the net.</p>\n<p>Already in the midst of a sensational rookie season, Ballard McBride continues to light up the scoresheet. With the day’s deciding goal, Ballard McBride now has his ninth goal of the season — leading all Gauchos in goals scored. He also has a pair of assists to his name, but the Australian’s ability to produce off the bench has been nothing short of phenomenal this year.</p>\n<p>Following the back-to-back goals, the remainder of the match proved to be a cagey affair with a total of 38 fouls across the two teams. Nevertheless, even with UC Davis outshooting UCSB 19 to 9, the Gauchos managed to hold on through two periods of extra time and secure a point on the road.</p>\n<p>The performance from UCSB’s sophomore goalkeeper, Ben Roach, was also worth noting as his nine total saves kept his side in it through all 110 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>The men’s soccer postseason starts in two weeks for the Gauchos, but the team still has a pair of road games ahead of them before they can think about playoff glory. For now, all eyes remain on the Big West and the conference berths will depend upon how these final fixtures play out.</p>\n<p>UCSB travels south to CSUN this Saturday, Oct. 26, for their penultimate regular season conference matchup — kickoff is set for 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

12 spot in the Top Drawer Soccer National Rankings. Although the record books say UCSB’s greatest unbeaten streak of 17 wins occurred back in 1982, the Gauchos are staring at potentially tying for second all-time in the program’s history if they come out of this week with twelve straight.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Still, even with the team finding themselves atop the Big West standings, conference matches always prove to be a formidable test.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">UC Riverside’s schedule hasn’t gone quite as smooth however, as the Highlanders are coming off of a 1-0 win over Cal Poly but only after six consecutive losses..</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">On the season, UCR stands at a 6-5-2 overall record and will start a new week of conference play first away at Santa Barbara before weekend travel to UC Davis — the Big West’s second-place team.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">UCSB has the historical advantage in this matchup, as the Gauchos lead in the all-time series over the Highlanders by a record of 26-6-2. This will also prove to be a bit of a revenge game for the home side as UCSB lost 1-0 to UCR in their previous matchup during last season’s conference campaign.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">After outscoring last week’s opponents by a tally of 7-0, there are several ones to watch for the Gauchos this week; two worth highlighting are sophomore keeper Ben Roach and senior defender Noah Billingsley. Through the unbeaten streak, Roach has amassed more clean sheets than not with six total shutouts — a wall in between the posts. Meanwhile, Billingsley was the orchestrator in the 5-0 win over Fullerton which had five different Gauchos score on the night. Although he wasn’t one of the scorers, Billingsley earned a hat trick in assists with three for his team.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For the Highlanders, junior forwards Roberto Garcia-Vargas and Hugo Magana Jr. have been the key attackers as the pair leads UCR in scoring with three goals scored each.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">All of the Big West action starts this Wednesday at Harder Stadium, when UCSB hosts UC Riverside on Oct. 16 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90458\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-16/no-12-ucsb-undefeated-in-ten-straight-set-to-host-ucr-and-uci/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90458\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-16/no-12-ucsb-undefeated-in-ten-straight-set-to-host-ucr-and-uci/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-16/no-12-ucsb-undefeated-in-ten-straight-set-to-host-ucr-and-uci/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-16/no-12-ucsb-undefeated-in-ten-straight-set-to-host-ucr-and-uci/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-16/no-12-ucsb-undefeated-in-ten-straight-set-to-host-ucr-and-uci/","id":1289,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1288,1287,1286],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
