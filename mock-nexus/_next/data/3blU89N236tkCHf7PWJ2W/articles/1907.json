The board includes an undergraduate and graduate representative from each UC campus, except UC San Francisco, which only has graduate students and thus only a graduate student representative. The board is tasked with meeting regularly to advise the system-wide office on Title IX policy changes and to provide student input on the office’s decisions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of publication, the system-wide Title IX Office and UC Office of the President Media Relations staff did not respond with information about whether the graduate position remains vacant. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the Nexus, Reynolds noted that the timing of her appointment is particularly important in light of recent sexual assault <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/sigma-pi-removes-fraternity-member-following-sexual-assault-allegations/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1578556795293000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGRkktG4x3EpTr6IfWY69YOkBQAow\">allegations</a> against fraternity members during Fall Quarter of 2019 and the subsequent campus <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/speculation-and-scrutiny-community-reacts-to-timely-warning/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1578556795295000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHsZSIXhGlRx0Nt7lrhQJT9fY0bRA\">response</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Right now, we’re at a very heightened time with regard to discourse around sexual assault and sexual harrassment [at UCSB] … so I think it’s really important that we use that discourse not just to bring awareness to these things and to talk about them, but also to provide tangible change that can prevent future instances,” Reynolds said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Right now, especially because I know of a lot of personal stories of students who have or have not gone to [the] Title IX [office] because they feel that the Title IX system is very backlogged, and it can just be extremely frightening to go to Title IX as it is.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, Reynolds served as the policy analyst for Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) and currently serves as its director, bringing the experience to her role as the undergraduate representative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the first projects I had was when the Department of Education released their proposed changes to the federal Title IX document, and my job was to read over that hundred-page legal document and condense it,” Reynolds said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The changes to Federal Title IX policy were first proposed in November 2018 by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and would </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">req</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uire “presumption of innocence throughout the grievance process” and a live cross-examination of survivors among other changes, according to the U.S. Department of Education <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-devos-proposed-title-ix-rule-provides-clarity-schools-support-survivors-and-due-process-rights-all&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1578556795289000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG2xXna0hJncvtIYtY4cFhcSfOIUg\">website</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The live cross-examination during the judicial process of a Title IX investigation would mean that survivors would be in the same room as potential perpetrators, allowing cross-examination through the potential perpetrators’ lawyer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It [is] very invasive and potentially retraumatizing, I remember that was one that I specifically had a problem with,” Reynolds said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Reynolds, it was important this year more than ever that UCSB had representation on the student advisory board, because she expects the Department of Education to make a decision about whether or not to implement the proposed federal Title IX changes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Title IX Student Advisory Board was first <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/ucsb-title-ix-student-advisory-board-selected-attends-first-meeting/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1578556795289000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE7uvwSiRXwKb9VOKubgI5ZjjybBw\">created</a> in November 2017 under the first system-wide Title IX Coordinator Kathleen Salvaty. In January 2018, Mariah Tanaka and Jennifer Selvidge were appointed as the undergraduate and graduate representatives to the board, respectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In summer 2018, Tanaka resigned, leaving the undergraduate position open and Selvidge as the only UCSB representative on the board. She later <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-08/ucsb-graduate-rep-resigns-from-title-ix-student-advisory-board/\">resigned</a> in November 2018 following a disagreement between her and system-wide Title IX leadership over comments made to Associated Students (A.S.) and the Graduate Student Association (GSA) over proposed policy changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since November 2018, UCSB has had no representation on the board. That December, GSA voted to boycott the board over the treatment of Selvidge and the lack of power in appointing its own candidate, since the system-wide office has final say over appointees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board has continued to operate over the past year without any UCSB representation. All UC representatives on the board ended their yearlong terms in the beginning of the 2019-20 academic year, so the Title IX office has had to work over Fall Quarter 2019 to not only fill long-lasting UCSB vacancies, but also new vacancies created at all of the other UC campuses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Reynolds, it is vital that all UC campuses are represented in decision-making, not only regarding Title IX but in all UC policies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students are the ones that are paying for these services and the people that are paid by the UC system, we’re paying for them,” Reynolds said. “So it’s important that we know exactly what that money is being used for, and that it’s a very transparent process and it’s not under some sort of blanket or that people don’t know what’s going on.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The full board will meet for the first time on Jan. 17 at UCOP’s office in Oakland. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the January 9 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

I gotta go and run my ass off,” he told himself as he set into the starting blocks.</p>\n<p>BANG!

His athleticism was evident even then, with a recorded 10.68 100m time in his senior year track season as well as his 35-plus-inch vertical leap.</p>\n<p>“It was tough and a big learning curve,” Azu-Irondi admitted. “It was good, though; I made some cool friends and learned a lot. As a little freshman coming in and playing football at a D-I university, it was tough but it was fun.”</p>\n<p>Azu-Irondi floundered in the transition to college football, though, as he redshirted his first year before transferring to his hometown community college, College of the Canyons, to live closer to his family and try to get back to a four-year university as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>“At College of the Canyons I was doing my best to get out with a scholarship, but things weren’t working out, but I was still fast, you know?” Azu-Irondi laughed. “So during track season, I did what I could and did my own recruiting.”</p>\n<p>After three back-and-forths with Coach Anderson, a former sprinter at Oregon, the prospective Canyon transfer was left wondering about his future and searched everywhere for a new track home. Finally, in the summer of 2015, Azu-Irondi sent an email asking if UCSB was still interested, and his new coach responded saying that he’d be a Gaucho in the fall.</p>\n<p>An ankle injury kept him sidelined for the vast majority of his first year in Santa Barbara, but Azu-Irondi chugged through this rough patch, biding his time for a historic return.</p>\n<p>“When I kicked it on around the 15-meter mark, I made up for it,” Azu-Irondi recalled of his historic dash at UC San Diego two weeks ago. “My turnover came in, not as fast as Coach has seen me or I had wanted it, but once I turned it on, I stayed strong even though I was a little tense after having to catch up from the slow start.”</p>\n<p>“It was a solid race. I’d say like a seven out of 10.”</p>\n<p>Azu-Irondi speaks so humbly of his 100m time, but when 10.55s flashed on the scoreboard next to his name, the San Fernando native solidified his place in the UCSB record books as the fastest man in school history — just barely beating Sandy Combs’s 30-year-old record of 10.56s.</p>\n<p>Perhaps he prefers to keep a low profile while he sends waves nationwide during his first D-I track season. But as every great runner knows, it takes a bit of arrogance to succeed on the track, and even Azu-Irondi, after enough prodding, confidently declared his goal for the season, which is as grand a goal as a college sprinter can have.</p>\n<p>“I’m gonna be in the World Championships in London. I have to hit a 10.12 to get to the trials and then go from there. I don’t want to jinx it, but I could see myself doing some crazy things. Especially with the help of Coach Anderson, I’m gonna get there for sure.”</p>\n<p>A bold benchmark to set for oneself, undoubtedly, but everything about Azu-Irondi is bold. He walks around the track with his chest out and a massive smile on his face and proceeds to leave the audience stunned with his smooth stride and blazing speed. His confidence can be seen in his step, but it is partnered with a hard-working, humble upbringing that clearly has the sprinter prepped for great success.</p>\n<p>Azu-Irondi is just getting started, too. With a season and a half left in his collegiate track career, who knows? Maybe he’ll leave UCSB with the 10 fastest 100m marks in school history. Every personal record will be a school record, and time is on his hands.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 and 9 of the April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76648\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/running-with-history-in-mind-the-emergence-of-sike-azu-irondi/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76648\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/running-with-history-in-mind-the-emergence-of-sike-azu-irondi/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/running-with-history-in-mind-the-emergence-of-sike-azu-irondi/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/running-with-history-in-mind-the-emergence-of-sike-azu-irondi/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/running-with-history-in-mind-the-emergence-of-sike-azu-irondi/","id":1904,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1903,1902,1901],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"For the Love of the Game: UCSB Club Baseball","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?resize=800%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Off to a hot 7-1 and 4-1 conference start, the UCSB club baseball team is looking to shock many as it has made its way into the national club rankings.

What the fourth-year UC Santa Barbara club baseball team captain lacks in terms of size and stature, he makes up with tremendous speed on the basepaths and lightning-quick bat speed. Think of a Dustin Pedroia or a Jose Altuve type. Rosenblum loves the game of baseball and plays with an immeasurable amount of hustle and heart. Not only does he play the game each time as if it is his last, Rosenblum is a true student of the game. After playing second base his first three years at UCSB, this offseason Rosenblum elected to make the transition to third base to open up a spot at second. To learn the nuances of playing third base he sought advice from UCSB division one infielder Jeremiah Muno.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76654\" style=\"width: 576px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76654\" data-attachment-id=\"76654\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-carries-5-game-win-streak-into-road-slate/img_0695-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_0695\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-76654\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?resize=566%2C425\" alt=\"\" width=\"566\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76654\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">UCSB club baseball’s core group of seniors out at the wood bat tournament in Mesquite, Nevada. <em>Photo courtesy of Max Fernbacher</em></p></div>\n<p>Rosenblum is just one of the reasons UCSB club baseball is off to a hot 7-1 start this season. The other contributions have come from the twenty-nine other players on the roster, all of whom are UCSB students. Four junior college transfers bolster the pitching staff and eight seniors provide leadership on the team. According to Rosenblum the team is composed of former high school and junior college baseball players that simply want to continue playing the sport they love.</p>\n<p>“Our team is made up of guys who want to continue their playing careers after high school or junior college. Many of us have tried to make the division one team here at UCSB but we were unable to secure a roster spot. That includes myself, as I was told I was too small. So we play club baseball because it allows us to play baseball at a high level while we are focused on getting a great education here at UCSB,” Rosenblum said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The club team at UCSB is part of the National Club Baseball Association (NCBA), a national body that governs club baseball at the collegiate level. College club teams in the NCBA either do not have NCAA baseball teams at their schools or like in the case of UCSB have generated enough interest to form a club team. The UCSB club team is in the Southern Pacific West Conference, a NCBA conference that includes Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, UCLA, the University of Southern California, Long Beach State and Cal State Fullerton. With a 4-1 conference record and 7-1 record overall, the Gauchos trail only Cal Poly SLO in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>In early March the team traveled to play in a wood bat tournament in Mesquite, Nevada and went undefeated in four games. Despite packing four or five ballplayers to a room and living off the $8 Chinese buffet down the street from the hotel, the Gauchos thrived on the field in Mesquite. There they defeated twentieth ranked Utah State to earn a national ranking of their own. Rosenblum could not remember a time in his four years when the UCSB club team had been ranked.</p>\n<p>The team’s early season success can be attributed to each player’s dedication to improvement. Unlike the division one team at UCSB, the club team does not have access to a state of the art weight room or a hitting facility with lights. They lift in the Robertson Gym weight room or UCSB Recreation Center and make the trip over to Girsh Park near Costco to get their hacks in. Last quarter, unable to reserve a diamond at Girsh Park, they practiced twice a week at night on the Recreation Center fields. In essence, the team has embraced the old adage “where there’s a will there’s a way” when it comes to honing their craft.</p>\n<p>Off the field, Rosenblum acts as club president and is thus responsible for all the team logistics. This includes dealing with jerseys, gear, finances and arranging field time for the team.</p>\n<p>“Dealing with team dues, uniforms, gear and umpires can be time consuming but it is just part of my role as president. But really nothing has been tougher than our inability to find a field for practices and games. We are at the bottom of the totem pole when it comes to getting field reservations, below high school and even little league teams in the area,” Rosenblum said.</p>\n<p>However, things are looking up for the team as spring quarter approaches. According to Rosenblum, the team has made arrangements to practice and play at Girsh Park for spring quarter. Thus, they will no longer have to practice at the Recreation Center fields nor have to travel 55 miles south to play their home games in Santa Paula.</p>\n<p>Michael Gilbert a fourth-year math major and first generation college student, credits the club baseball team as the most important extracurricular outlet for him in college. The self-described “pride of Moreno Valley”, Gilbert has a love for the game that compares to Rosenblum’s. Quiet and humble, similar to fellow Moreno Valley native Kawhi Leonard, Gilbert has been a valuable utility player for the team the past four years. Gilbert says playing on the club team all four years of college has been his defining experience at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“To be honest, I do not think I would have been able to get this far in school if I was not playing club baseball. I did not know what I was getting myself into coming to UCSB and we all know college can be very taxing on your mind. I feel lucky to have been able to play baseball for the past four years with a group of guys that became my best friends. Joining club baseball was the best decision I made in my four years at UCSB”, Gilbert said.</p>\n<p>Communications major Erik VanWinkle, another fourth year student on the club team, has enjoyed his time playing on the club team and hopes the team can make the NCBA World Series this year.</p>\n<p>“All the games coming up in April will be huge for us. We hit the ball really well in Mesquite so hopefully we can continue doing that, play some good defense and win ballgames. The team, especially our seniors, want to make it to the club nationals in North Carolina this year,” VanWinkle said.</p>\n<p>The UCSB club baseball team (7-1) looks to continue its winning ways on April 8th and 9th, when they host a three game home series against the University of Southern California (1-8).</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76651\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/for-the-love-of-the-game-ucsb-club-baseball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76651\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/for-the-love-of-the-game-ucsb-club-baseball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/for-the-love-of-the-game-ucsb-club-baseball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/for-the-love-of-the-game-ucsb-club-baseball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/for-the-love-of-the-game-ucsb-club-baseball/","id":1905,"author":{"id":149,"name":"Max Fernbacher"},"related":[1904,1903,1902],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2016-17 NBA Awards Predictions: Will ‘The Beard’ Prevail?","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-04-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-17-at-12.09.48-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-17-at-12.09.48-AM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With the regular season officially over, it is now time to reflect upon each player’s impact and determine what praise is deserved.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>Most Valuable Player: James Harden, Houston Rockets</strong></p>\n<p>When the NBA MVP race is this close, it comes down to wins.

Harden leads the league in offensive win shares per Basketball Reference as well as win shares overall. That’s generally a pretty good indicator of a worthy MVP.</p>\n<p>Westbrook leads the league in player efficiency rating, another solid MVP benchmark. There’s a counter for every argument but one: wins.<br>\nHarden’s Rockets have secured the third seed in the west while Westbrook’s Thunder was only able to sneak in at the six spot. With that, Harden is the rightful MVP.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Player of Year: Draymond Green, Golden State Warriors</strong></p>\n<p>Almost no one likes Draymond Green, and for good reason: He plays dirty, as Steven Adams can tell you, and he can be incredibly annoying. That said, he’s still the best defensive player in the league this year.</p>\n<p>Honestly, I think there’s a serious case to be made that he’s been the best defender in the league for the past few years, but that’s a different debate.<br>\nNo one else in the NBA quarterbacks a defense like Green does. He’s constantly moving and talking, the heart and soul of a very good Warriors defense.</p>\n<p>He’s tied for the league lead in steals with John Wall, and he’s 14th in blocks.<br>\nOpponents shoot just 40 percent when matched up with Green, per NBA.com. That number rises to only 48.2 percent from inside six feet. Just for reference, opponents shoot 49 percent against Rudy Gobert, who’s quite a bit larger than Green.</p>\n<p>Gobert and Kawhi Leonard are both fantastic defenders, but they just can’t compare with what Green does on defense.</p>\n<p>He’s the most versatile and effective defender in the NBA, and that’s why he’s my Defensive Player of the Year.</p>\n<p><strong>Rookie of the Year: Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers</strong></p>\n<p>Joel Embiid was the best rookie in the NBA this year. That’s why he should get the award.</p>\n<p>It’s really that simple. I realize he only played in 31 games, but that doesn’t matter.</p>\n<p>Just because Malcolm Brogdon and Dario Saric played all year doesn’t mean they were better rookies than Embiid.</p>\n<p>In only 25 minutes per game, Embiid averaged 20.2 points and 7.8 rebounds, all while giving Philadelphia the first breath of basketball hope it’s felt since “The Process” began.</p>\n<p>When Embiid was on the court, he was as dominant as any rookie I can remember, holding his own against players like DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis.</p>\n<p>There’s no way that Brogdon (10.2/2.8/4.3) or Saric (12.8/6.3/2.2) match up with what Embiid did, even taking into account the missed games. Were this the MVP award, I could agree with the pro-Brogdon/Saric arguments. This is the Rookie of the Year Award, though, and Embiid is far and away the most deserving candidate.</p>\n<p><strong>Sixth Man of the Year: Andre Iguodala, Golden State Warriors</strong></p>\n<p>It’s hard to feel good about giving any award to a player with a slash line of 7.6/4.0/3.4. Those are solid numbers for a role player but they don’t exactly scream “Sixth Man of the Year” at first glance.</p>\n<p>That’s why it’s important to go a little deeper with Andre Iguodala.<br>\nEric Gordon and Lou Williams have flashier stats, but Iguodala has been absolutely essential to the Warriors, particularly after Kevin Durant went down with a knee injury.</p>\n<p>Iguodala’s 4.5 assist-to-turnover ratio is the best in the league, a demonstration of how he steadies the occasionally turbulent Warriors offense.</p>\n<p>He’s still a top-notch defender, too, with a solid 101 defensive rating. A scoring average of 7.6 points per game makes Iguodala an unexciting award candidate, but the rest of his stats make him a deserving one.</p>\n<p><strong>Most Improved Player: James Johnson, Miami Heat</strong></p>\n<p>Coming into this season, there were essentially no outside expectations for James Johnson. He was a largely anonymous veteran backup on a one-year, $4 million deal who had never averaged double-digit points per game and hadn’t played much the season prior.</p>\n<p>Over the course of this season, Johnson became one of the linchpins of Miami’s stunning drive to playoff contention, averaging career highs in points (12.8), rebounds (4.9), assists (3.6) and three-point percentage (34.5 percent, up from 30.3 the year before).</p>\n<p>If that’s not enough to win Most Improved Player, then I don’t know what is.</p>\n<p><strong>Coach of the Year: Mike D’Antoni, Houston Rockets</strong></p>\n<p>The Houston Rockets finished one game ahead of the Utah Jazz for the Western Conference eighth seed with a 41-41 record last year. They were dysfunctional and depressing.</p>\n<p>Harden seemed disinterested at times while Dwight Howard was clearly disinterested at all times. Mike D’Antoni turned this team around.<br>\nThe Rockets were projected to finish 11th in the Western Conference this season by Bleacher Report but, instead, they’re the third seed with more than 50 wins.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, D’Antoni’s offensive system has pushed the Rockets from 106.5 points per game last year to 115.2 this year, behind only the Golden State Warriors.</p>\n<p>Golden State’s Steve Kerr, Washington’s Scott Brooks and Boston’s Brad Stevens are all very strong candidates for the award, but none of those coaches have accomplished anything close to the kind of job D’Antoni has in bringing his team from the infighting and apathy of last year’s Rockets to the excellence of this year’s version.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 13, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76864\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/2016-17-nba-awards-predictions-will-the-beard-prevail/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76864\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/2016-17-nba-awards-predictions-will-the-beard-prevail/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/2016-17-nba-awards-predictions-will-the-beard-prevail/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/2016-17-nba-awards-predictions-will-the-beard-prevail/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/2016-17-nba-awards-predictions-will-the-beard-prevail/","id":1906,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[1905,1904,1903],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
