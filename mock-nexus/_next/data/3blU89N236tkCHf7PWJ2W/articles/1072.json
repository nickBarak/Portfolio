With the loss, the Gauchos now drop to 3-12 on the season, and sit in last place in the Big West with an 0-2 record during conference play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many ways, Saturday’s game magnified the issues the Gauchos have had all season: slow starts, inefficient offense and lack of depth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In front of a home crowd of 1,100 people, the Mustangs came out firing in the first quarter, desperate to pick up their first conference win of the season. In that quarter, Cal Poly outscored Santa Barbara 18-10, shooting 50 percent from the floor while holding the Gauchos to only 33 percent shooting. Perhaps most importantly, the Mustangs outrebounded UCSB by a margin of 9-4, with junior center Natalia Bruening having to sit for Santa Barbara after picking up two early fouls. Once again, the Gauchos found themselves having to play from behind the entire game, only holding the lead for 21 seconds in the entire game.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside of Miller’s career night, Santa Barbara’s offensive deficiencies once again hamstrung their ability to keep pace with the Mustangs. After scoring only 3 points in the first quarter, Miller went ballistic on the offensive end, scoring 30 points combined in the last three quarters while shooting 59 percent from the floor and 50 percent from deep. One of the biggest bright spots for the team this season, Miller displayed her elite shooting touch on Saturday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside of Miller, however, the Gauchos shot merely 37 percent from the floor; in fact, the rest of the team made combined for only two three-pointers on the night. With Bruening logging only 14 minutes due to foul trouble, Santa Barbara lacked a presence in the paint </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">forcing them to take difficult shots all night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside of Coco Miller and sophomore guards Danae Miller and Bri Anugwom </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who both scored 12 points on the night </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">no Gaucho player scored more than 4 points on Saturday. Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson once again relied heavily on her starters, with the Santa Barbara bench contributing only 4 points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the flip side, Cal Poly found themself getting good looks all night. For a normally anemic offense, the Mustangs played one of their best offensive games of the season, shooting 50 percent from the floor. With seven players scoring more than 7 points each, the Gaucho defense struggled to contain the balanced Mustang approach.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the night, Cal Poly was paced by senior guard Dye Stahley, who scored 16 points on 4-9 shooting. Freshman guard Maddie Willett also played one of her best games on the season, scoring 15 points while shooting 60 percent from the floor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, the Gauchos should be commended for their effort despite what has been a trying season. Just as they did against CSUN two weeks ago, UCSB outscored Cal Poly in the fourth quarter in a valiant comeback attempt. Unfortunately, as has been the case for much of the season, they fell just a little bit short.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking to get back on track in conference play, the Gauchos will now turn their attention to Long Beach State. After struggling in non-conference play, the Beach picked up a commanding victory last Thursday, defeating UC Riverside 63-45.

Ramsey and McLaughlin, a pair of sophomores, control the ball on the attack for the offense, but it is graduate guard Ar’Mond Davis who delivers the bulk of the scoring for the Gauchos with 14.2 points per game.

Sow is the most efficient shooter in the Big West Conference, shooting 58.2 percent on field goals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been flashes of stardom from the other two freshmen on the team as guard Sékou Touré has the highest player efficiency rating in the Big West and as forward Jay Nagle owns the third best three-point percentage in the conference with 46.2 percent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With such a well-rounded team for the Gauchos this season, the real question is who will face the wrath of Head Coach Joe Pasternack in his second season with Santa Barbara.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a look at all of the teams in the fight for the Big West crown:</span></p>\n<p><b>UC Irvine, 12-4</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anteaters held the top spot in the conference for the majority of the first half of the season before losing a couple toward the end of their non-conference schedule. Neck and neck with the Gauchos, Irvine has earned the mid-major No. 15 spot with a 12-4 record, placing the team second in the Big West. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Eaters opened the year up 7-0 with big wins against Texas A&amp;M and Santa Clara. They followed it up with another impressive victory of 80-75 over Saint Mary’s College in late November but finished off their non-conference season with a pair of losses a month later. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, this Irvine team has a remarkable rotation with a dangerous and experienced duo of guards in the backcourt in, thanks to junior guards Evan Leonard and Max Hazzard who bolster Irvine’s deadly three-point attacks. Irvine’s 36.2 percent from deep is ideal when competing against the first-place Gauchos, who allow just 28.1 percent from the three, the 13th best in the NCAA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCI’s graduate forward Jonathan Galloway sits in the No. 2 spot of the Big West in rebounding with 7.3 boards per game while senior forward Elston Jones supports with 7.1 rebounds per game, fifth in the conference. The pair of big men patrol the paint as well as any frontcourt in the Big West, allowing just 66.6 points against per contest which ranks slightly below UCSB’s top mark of 64.3 average points allowed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anteaters, who surrender just 38 percent of field goals from opponents, thrive on the defensive end with the best defensive shooting percentage in the Big West. This makes the Eaters the most significant threat against UCSB which currently shoots a conference best of 48.1 percent from the field this year.</span></p>\n<p><b>University of Hawaii, 9-5</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winners of three games straight, the Rainbow Warriors have emerged as legitimate contenders to make a run for the title of Big West Champion as they currently sit in third place heading into the latter half of the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawaii has a solid collective of starters that can score the ball well, as four players average double-figures in points led by junior guard Eddie Stansberry who posts 13.2 points per game following a 26-point performance against Alabama A&amp;M.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Stansberry delivers the most scoring on average, it is sophomore guard Drew Buggs who strikes with a pass-first mentality. Buggs owns the second highest assists per game in the Big West, averaging 5.0 per contest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buggs has an array of weapons at his disposal with Stansberry running the wing but when the Warriors look to move the ball inside, junior Zigmars Raimo is the likely recipient.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raimo, a Latvia native, rebounds at the fifth highest rate in the Big West with 7.1 boards per game while shooting 57 percent from the field, placing him as third in the conference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawaii recorded statement wins against University of Colorado at Boulder and Utah earlier in the non-conference half of the season to build up its resume and makes an underdog run for the Big West title come conference play. </span></p>\n<p><b>Cal State Northridge, 6-10</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a 6-24 season, one of the most disappointing years in program history, Cal State Northridge wiped the slate clean with the hire of first year Head Coach Mark Gottfried, in addition to adding former NBA Champion Mo Williams to the assistant coaching staff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new-look leadership is certainly a huge reason why the Matadors rank among the best offenses in the Big West, but without freshman phenom Lamine Diane, CSUN could be in the same position as the season prior.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diane has catapulted CSUN into fourth place in the conference through his Big West best of 24.3 points and 11.1 rebounds per game. The freshman also ranks among the top defenders with 1.7 steals per game while blocking 2.3 shots on average, both coming in first in the Big West as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the CSUN attack doesn’t just rely on Diane’s two-way ability. While the freshman tops out the Big West as the No. 1 scorer, it is sophomore guard Terrell Gomez who delivers 18.4 points on average for the third best mark among Big West players. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complementing Gomez in the backcourt, freshman guard Darius Brown II produces a play-making boost with 5.1 assists per contest, another first place in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Irvine is UCSB’s biggest threat on the defensive end, the Matadors are certainly the top threat on offense with their harrowing attack. CSUN ties UCSB in first with 77.8 points per game while passing the ball better than any other team in the Big West. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only thing holding CSUN back? Its sluggish defense. The Matadors are last in opponent field goal percentage, allowing a massive 82.9 points per contest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There may be some kinks to smooth out but CSUN is a contender for the long hall with a trio of young, ambitious attackers and new leadership at the helm.</span></p>\n<p><b>Long Beach State, 6-10</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tied for fourth in the conference with two other squads, the 49ers look to turn their season around come conference play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beach has relied on the dynamic offensive production by senior guard Deishuan Booker who has posted 14.2 points per contest, the third most in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the paint, redshirt senior center Temidayo Yussuf drags down 7.2 rebounds per game for the Niners as he contributes 12.9 points on average. Yussuf shoots at the seventh best rate in the Big West, knocking down 49.7 percent on field goals, but Long Beach still struggles offensively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Niners have shot just 41.7 percent from the field this season, the lowest mark in the Big West, while they fail to take care of the ball as well, with conference-high 16.0 turnovers per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While CSUN appears to be in first-place contention for years to come with a trio of talented young players, Long Beach seems to be searching for its next generation of studs as all three of its top leading scorers are seniors and will depart from the program next year.</span></p>\n<p><b>UC Riverside, 5-10</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talk about a team that can shoot the three well. Between junior guard Dikymbe Martin and sophomore forward Ajani Kennedy, the Highlanders have one of the most dangerous three-point duos in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martin is the only double-digit scorer on the Highlanders with 15.9 points per game as the fifth best scorer in the conference, but he also hits on 44.8 percent from behind the arc.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Kennedy, the sophomore out of Moreno Valley owns the most efficient three-point percentage in the conference, shooting 56.3 percent from deep along with his 7.5 points per game which is second on the Riverside roster. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just a hundredth of a percent behind UC Irvine, Riverside is second in the Big West in shooting from the perimeter with 37 percent but struggles to get second chance opportunities on misses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nobody on the Highlanders roster brings down over 4.5 rebounds per game as UCR is the second worst rebounding team in the Big West, solely in front of last-place UC Davis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expect minimal post play while jumpers are hoisted from deep since the Highlanders shoot the most three-pointers in the Big West. But who can blame them? With a pair of spot-up shooters like Martin and Kennedy, all eyes should be around the perimeter. </span></p>\n<p><b>Cal Poly, 4-9</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mustangs have hit a metaphorical wall in the world of Big West basketball. The last time Cal Poly had a winning team was during the 2012-13 season and coming off a 9-22 year, Poly showed that this season is more of the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not all bad for the Mustangs who have a leader in senior point guard Donovan Fields who posts 15.8 points per game to go along with 4.3 assists.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, sophomore wing Mark Crowe is a dynamic threat from virtually anywhere on the floor as he shoots the fifth best rate from the field in the Big West while also splashing 51.6 percent from range, No. 2 in the conference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, much like the Highlanders, Cal Poly doesn’t have a solid facilitator to protect the restricted area in its strife to get rebounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only two of Cal Poly’s four wins have come against Division I programs </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of those schools is playing its first season in Division I.</span></p>\n<p><b>Cal State Fullerton, 4-10</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming off of a Cinderella Big West Tournament last season that ultimately landed them in March Madness, Fullerton loaded its front half of the season with difficult matchups throughout. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Titans have a pair of two of the most effective scorers in the Big West as seniors [[senior guards]] Kyle Allman Jr. and Khalil Ahmad pose significant threats to any defense. Allman Jr. adds 18.5 points per game while Ahmad follows close behind with 18.2 on average. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With junior forward Jackson Rowe averaging 7.2 rebounds per game in the post, the third most in the Big West, Fullerton seems to have all the bases covered.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, the lingering question remains: what the heck is this team doing wrong? My answer: playing teams that are, quite simply, better than them. Fullerton gets little to no production from its offense, barring the three aforementioned starters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, with a dangerous offense, don’t count out the Titans. CSUF looks like the ideal team to impede a playoff-hopeful team with its dynamic scoring duo, so make sure to remember the Titans when they face off against top teams in the Big West. </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Davis, 4-10</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sitting in dead last, the Aggies have suffered a heartbreaking year. Heading into 2018-19, Davis had eyed a repeat crown as Big West regular season champions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Aggies returned every starter from last year’s first place roster, but the results are drastically different. Davis hasn’t won a game on the road this season, going a shocking 0-7 when playing away this year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With senior forward AJ John out with an injury halfway through the season, senior guard and 2017-18 Big West MVP TJ Shorts II is left to bear the scoring burden. His 14.2 points per game just haven’t been enough to carry the Aggies’ struggling offense, which scores only 62.9 points each contest, the least in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Aggies have trouble shooting from deep and have been unable to match teams on the boards with a -3.6 rebounding margin, another Big West Conference low. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On paper, the Aggies should be a fierce competitor with 2017-18 Coach of the Year Jim Les at the helm but on the hardwood, finding points have been slim pickings, something they hope will turn around come Big West play. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

The fans were jumping out of their seats and the energy in this Blue-Green rivalry seemed to even surpass the rivalry on the soccer field.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos came out the gates with a burst of energy of their own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They started off the game hot from the three, as Jaquori Mclaughlin knocked down his first two triples, and combined with an early Ar’mond Davis deep shot, UCSB jumped out to an early 11-5 lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, after a very early timeout, the Mustangs showed that they weren’t going to go down easy. Donovan Fields put up two quick buckets to cut the lead to three and effectively stopped the Gauchos early run. The junior guard has commanded the offense all season for the Mustangs, averaging a team-leading 16.1 points to go along with 4.6 assists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although most defenders that the Gauchos threw at him had a significant height advantage, Fields was still able to get to the basket at will, and he ended the game with a team-high of 19 points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main theme of the first half for UCSB was fluidity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coach Pasternack made five subs in the first five minutes, which allowed the Gauchos to play an intense switch-heavy defense to start off the game. Combined with great off the ball movement on the offensive end, UCSB’s hockey-style substitutions meant that the rock was not in any one player’s hand for long. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although they started off hot from the three-point range, the Gauchos also didn’t settle for long jumpers as the ball zipped around on offense, leading to easy buckets for the frontcourt. A layup by freshman Amadou Sow, followed by a thunderous Robinson Idehen dunk in the next possession, lit up the Thunderdome and gave UCSB a 24-14 lead with just under seven minutes to go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal Poly did not back down, however, and a quick 11-2 run by the Mustangs cut the lead down to just one point with two minutes to go in the half. Cal Poly was not very efficient from three, but back to back deep jumpers by Donovan Fields and Kuba Niziol forced the Gauchos to call a time-out, and it seemed as if the two teams would be deadlocked going into the half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jaquori Mclaughlin had other plans, however. After a couple of quick buckets by freshman Sekou Toure, the Oregon State transfer knocked down his fourth three of the half to put UCSB up 35-27 going into halftime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two teams started the second half off by trading buckets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the frenetic pace at the start of the game favored UCSB, the Mustangs were able to slow the game down in the second period. Freshman Daxton Carr knocked down a couple buckets to bring the score to 43-41 with 14 minutes to go, and for a second it seemed as if Cal Poly had finally worn down the switch-heavy Gaucho defense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, just as the Mustangs were poised to take the lead, UCSB kicked into another gear. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s always about our defense,” Head Coach Joe Pasternack explained postgame. “Holding them to 37 percent from the field was the key to the game for us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos stifled Cal Poly in the last 10 minutes, but another important factor was cleaning up the glass to finish off their solid defensive possessions. UCSB ended with a 45-35 advantage in rebounding, and their +16 second-chance point margin showed that they didn’t allow the Mustangs to get multiple possessions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With nine minutes left to go, junior guard Max Heidegger knocked down his only bucket of the game to put the Gauchos up two, and they never looked back, as the lead never went under five again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four clutch free throws by transfer guard Devearl Ramsey helped seal the game down the stretch, and threes by Armond Davis and Jaquori Mclaughlin ballooned the lead to double digits as the clock wore down.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately this was a great win for the Gauchos to start off conference play. However, they know they have a long and arduous road ahead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every game we play… we don’t have a margin of error,” Pasternack said. “Every conference game moving ahead is gonna be more [difficult], every time we play it’s not gonna be easy.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 9, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

It’s our last weekend at home and it’s our last series in conference, so we’re going to play with our hearts and go all out. We just to have to know that we’re better and that we can do it.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach travels to Santa Barbara at 36-16 overall and 13-5 in conference. Third-place Cal Poly also figures into the mix, just one game behind both the Gauchos and 49ers. The Mustangs play last-place UC Riverside this weekend.</p>\n<p>While both Santa Barbara and CSULB stand atop the standings, it is the Gauchos that carry the momentum as winners of 12 of their last 14 games. UCSB will also have the advantage of playing at home for its seniors with Senior Day on Sunday. Long Beach, on the other hand, was swept by Cal Poly last weekend to lose control of its lead in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>“We’re all really excited. Even at practice today, we had a big team talk about how we want to see our name on that selection show on Sunday,” junior third baseman Jenessa Jeppesen said. “We have to take it one game at a time.”</p>\n<p>After sweeping Riverside last weekend, sophomore catcher Meme Moore was named Big West Field Player of the Week. Moore had an incredible series, tallying a slugging percentage of .800 and a batting average of .600. In the series finale, she hit 4-4 with two runs and two RBI. Moore is currently tied for first in the Big West in doubles with 13.</p>\n<p>Last weekend, Wisdom was on her game as well, as she gave up just three earned runs in the circle while hitting 6-10 from the plate with three runs and one RBI on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>At 21-13, Wisdom is approaching an important milestone this weekend. Currently tied with Sandy Ortigies for most career wins at 62, Wisdom could etch her name into the UCSB record books with a win against Long Beach. Ortigies’ record has stood since 1987.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, the record doesn’t really matter to me unless we get those two wins,” Wisdom said. “I’m only a win away and that one win won’t matter. We need [two].”</p>\n<p>One thing these two teams have in common is that offense can come from anyone. Last weekend, the Gauchos’ offensive success was a team effort. In game one, for example, seven of 10 players in the Santa Barbara lineup got a hit and five had at least two hits.</p>\n<p>One of Santa Barbara’s biggest offensive weapons is freshman left fielder Kristen Clark, who leads the league in batting average (.432) and in hits (83). The lead-off hitter leads the league in hits by a large margin with the second-ranked player with 67, 16 less than Clark. Two weekends ago against Hawaii, she broke the single-season UCSB hits record previously owned by Assistant Coach Christine Ramos.</p>\n<p>“It helps a lot when we get our bunts down and move runners around,” Wisdom said. “Hitting is contagious, so once one person gets a hit, the next person can get a hit easier.”</p>\n<p>The 49ers’ success also relies on offensive production from multiple players. Senior second baseman Cya Neal is tied for third in the Big West in runs and ranks fifth in hits, while sophomore left fielder Darian Tautalafua sits in fifth in conference in runs. Furthermore, junior shortstop Shayna Kimbrough ranks fourth in conference in hits and third in batting average. Teammate and senior right fielder Sarah Carrasco is tied for first with Meme Moore in doubles. Senior catcher Karli Sandoval and senior first baseman Ashlynn Booker sit in third and fifth in league in RBI, respectively. Booker also ranks sixth in home runs.</p>\n<p>As a team, Long Beach leads the league in runs, hits, RBI, batting average and on-base percentage.</p>\n<p>“They can read the defense well, so we need to make sure we don’t let them read us,” Wisdom said. “[Long Beach wants] exactly what we want, so they’re going to come out and compete and we need to be ready for it.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, senior Erin Jones-Wesley is LBSU’s top-pitcher. Her ERA of 2.96 ranks third in the Big West. UCSB, meanwhile, will counter with Wisdom, who ranks fifth at 3.17.</p>\n<p>The 49ers also have depth in their bullpen and will look to junior Amanda Hansen as well, who ranks just behind Wisdom in ERA at 3.17.</p>\n<p>“The biggest thing for us is taking it one pitch at a time,” Jeppesen said. “We need to not get too excited and stay composed and play our best.”</p>\n<p>First pitch is set for noon tomorrow. After tomorrow’s double-header, the series will wrap up Saturday with game three beginning at noon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 6 of May 8, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55214\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-08/gauchos-face-long-beach-state-with-ncaa-tournament-birth-at-the-line/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55214\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-08/gauchos-face-long-beach-state-with-ncaa-tournament-birth-at-the-line/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-08/gauchos-face-long-beach-state-with-ncaa-tournament-birth-at-the-line/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-08/gauchos-face-long-beach-state-with-ncaa-tournament-birth-at-the-line/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-08/gauchos-face-long-beach-state-with-ncaa-tournament-birth-at-the-line/","id":1069,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1068,1067,1066],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
