The loss marked the first time in program history that the Aggies have beaten the Gauchos twice in a single season. It was also the fifth loss in the last six games for UCSB.</p>\n<p>With the pair of losses, Santa Barbara drops to 9-5-3 overall and 3-4-1 in the Big West. Six points out of playoff contention with only two games remaining, UCSB’s chances of making playoffs are extremely slim. Davis, on the other hand, takes control of first place, improving to 8-5-4 overall and 6-2 in the conference.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s hard,” senior midfielder Nic Ryan said. “We’ve got a couple games left, but I don’t think we’re going to make the Big West tournament because of this and that was our goal for the year, so we feel like we’ve failed.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos looked like the better team the entire game and were extremely dangerous from the start, outshooting the Aggies 26 to 11.</p>\n<p>“Every game we play, it’s the same story,” junior midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “No matter how many shots you have, if you don’t put them on frame or put them in the back of the net, they don’t really count. We were hoping for that second goal, but we unfortunately didn’t get it.”</p>\n<p>In the 28th minute, UCSB finally found the back of the net on a goal from senior forward Achille Campion, who was back in the lineup for the first time since Sept. 16 due to injury. UCSB exhibited beautiful passing with junior midfielder Goffin Boyoko receiving a ball streaking towards the endline, who passed it back to Ryan in the penalty box. Ryan then sent the ball square to freshman midfielder Ema Boateng, who flicked it to Campion. Campion converted for his sixth goal of the season and give UCSB a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>“It was a nice build up play,” head coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “It’s something we hadn’t seen and something we’ve been looking for as far as combination play. It was great.”</p>\n<p>UCSB continued to dominate the possession in the first half, but went into halftime tied at one apiece due to a goal by Davis with three seconds remaining in the first half. Davis sent a ball into the box, which was headed down by junior defender Peter Schmetz. Unfortunately for the Gauchos, the header went off the heel of Boyoko and landed into feet of sophomore defender Ramon Martin del Campo, who passed the ball to sophomore forward Matt Sheldon. Sheldon sent the ball across the goal and past Mansker to equalize the game.</p>\n<p>“We kept saying, we’re due to catch a break…something has to go right,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s crazy. You’d think you’d get a break on something and we didn’t get one today. [The ball] can’t go off his heel and bounce up or go somewhere else?”</p>\n<p>Entering overtime deadlocked at one goal, Sheldon came up big once again for his team. On a long throw in by the Aggies, UCSB sophomore keeper Austin Mansker came out to grab the ball, but missed. Scrambling ensued in the box. Sheldon got a shot off, which was blocked by Schmetz on the goal line. However, Sheldon converted on the rebound.Sheldon led the Aggies offensively with the two goals on four shots.</p>\n<p>“They got a throw in, which is their best way of scoring,” Ryan said. “The ball rolled to one of their players and they put it in.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos begged the referee for a foul call, claiming Mansker was pushed and that his arm was grabbed, but was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>“We like to control the result, but I feel the ref took that away from us,” Ryan said. “He called a lot in the box the whole game and to let guys go up like that and hit our keeper is totally on him.”</p>\n<p>As the team started to walk off the field, senior defender Peter McGlynn pushed the ref to the ground, earning himself a red card. He was escorted off the field by UCSB police, although Vom Steeg said the referee doesn’t plan on pressing charges.</p>\n<p>“When you say, ‘well I think everything could go wrong,’ now it has,” Vom Steeg said. “I didn’t see it coming. Obviously, [his season is] done. There are lines you don’t cross, and if you cross the line, the privilege to be a Division I college athlete is gone.”</p>\n<p>In Friday’s non-conference match-up against Stanford, UCSB lost 1-0 on a golden goal in overtime, the team’s second consecutive loss in extra time. With the win, the Cardinal improve to 7-7-1.</p>\n<p>“We did a lot of good things, but no one wanted to score,” Vom Steeg said. “We just didn’t put the ball in the back of the net and that’s the extent of it.”</p>\n<p>It took over 95 minutes for either team to score, with Stanford securing the win on a header from their leading scorer, Adam Jahn. Sophomore midfielder Jimmy Callinan sent a beautiful cross from about midfield into the box, which Jahn snapped into the back of the net, past sophomore keeper Austin Mansker, who had no chance of saving the shot. The goal was Jahn’s ninth goal of the season.</p>\n<p>“The only thing we discussed was the fact that the only way this team was going to score was if the ball goes wide and they cross it into the box,” Vom Steeg said. “They had two guys open on that last play, so that’s a breakdown.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos outshot the Cardinal 16-12, including 7-3 in the second half, but both team shot an even four shots on goal.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t think we had a whole lot of chances, but we had some good ones that would’ve allowed us to score and take the game,” Baiden said. “We aren’t taking advantage of our opportunities.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s best opportunity came in the second half with just 21 seconds remaining in regulation when senior midfielder Dion Acoff dribbled down the left sideline before cutting in and taking a shot from the center of the 18 yard box.  Unfortunately for UCSB, the shot went wide left.</p>\n<p>“It’s frustrating because we do a lot of good things and I thought we got good performances from different players, but it’s the same repeating theme — nothing on frame,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>Leading the attack for the Gauchos was McGlynn, who took three shots on the evening.  In the first half, McGlynn struck a bending ball from the right side of the box that had Stanford’s keeper beat, but rolled just wide of the post.</p>\n<p>“I thought he hit three really good shots,” Vom Steeg said. The one was very unlucky that it went just wide of the post.  McGlynn, right now, is one of our better players and he’s playing at a high level.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will play its final two games of the regular season next week with Sac State on Wednesday.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48462\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-downed-davis-overtime/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48462\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-downed-davis-overtime/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-downed-davis-overtime/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-downed-davis-overtime/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-downed-davis-overtime/","id":1612,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1611,1610,1609],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Ends Season With Loss","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A late second half goal against the UCSB women’s soccer team brought a disappointing conclusion to the team’s season, as the Gauchos were unable to find the back of the net against rival Cal Poly ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A late second half goal against the UCSB women’s soccer team brought a disappointing conclusion to the team’s season, as the Gauchos were unable to find the back of the net against rival Cal Poly in their final game of the year yesterday afternoon and lost 1-0.</p>\n<p>“If you look at the statistics, it was a dead even statistical game, except for [the score],” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “This was one of the more complete performances by everybody; this was a game where so many people played well.”</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara finishes the year with a 5-12-2 overall record and 2-6-1 in conference.

Nevertheless, they were unable to draw even against the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>“They worked so hard and they just have not been rewarded for their efforts this year,” Stumpf said. “I wish we could keep going because we are so close with this.”</p>\n<p>UCSB says goodbye to three seniors, but will retain a large portion of this year’s squad as they look to be serious contenders for next year’s Big West title.</p>\n<p>“We gained so much experience with our young players; we were in every game and the girls did a good job of always competing and always working hard,” Stumpf said. “I definitely like the future of this program.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48456\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-ends-season-loss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48456\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-ends-season-loss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-ends-season-loss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-ends-season-loss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-29/ucsb-ends-season-loss/","id":1610,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1609,1608,1607],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Sees Top Keepers in Pair of Games this Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_10.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_10.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Preview UCSB women's soccer vs. UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After splitting its road games last week, the UCSB women’s soccer team will stay at home to play UC Riverside this Friday before traveling to Cal State Fullerton on Sunday, in what is the team’s second-to-last week of conference play remaining.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara comes into the weekend’s matches with an overall record of 8-6-1 and 2-2 in the Big West conference.

Taking over the starting position at the beginning of the season, Ritter has amassed seven shutouts, the most in the Big West. The eight combined shutouts this year rank fifth in program history for a single season and the most since 2008.</p>\n<p>Although Ritter has been one of the hottest goalkeepers, the Gauchos will encounter goalies just as impressive this weekend. Both Riverside’s and Fullerton’s goalkeepers rank in the top three in save percentage and shutouts.</p>\n<p>UC Riverside suffered its first conference loss last week against UC Irvine by a 2-0 margin. Prior to that the Highlanders had outscored its opponents 5-1 in two league matches with much of the success due in large part to sophomore goalkeeper Elizabeth Silas who ranks fourth in the Big West in total saves (73). Silas has allowed only three goals in the last four games and has emerged as an elite goalkeeper in the Big West.</p>\n<p>After playing UC Riverside, Santa Barbara travels south to Fullerton for another conference challenge. Fullerton’s goalkeeper, senior Lindsey Maricic ranks first in save percentage and total saves so far this season, being a deciding factor in the two games the Titans have earned results in.</p>\n<p>Aside from Maricic on the defensive side of the ball, UCSB will also have to take into account senior midfielder/forward Erica Mazeau. Mazeau has played both her positions well this season, leading the team in goals with three and assists with four.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s defense has been the team’s backbone, however, the team has become a threat offensively. Junior midfielder Madison Beckley leads the team with five goals, ranking third in the league and sophomore forward Angelisa Cortez has notched three goals of her own for the team.</p>\n<p>Kick-off for Friday’s game against UC Riverside is scheduled for 7 p.m. and Sunday’s match versus Cal State Fullerton will begin at 6 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 17th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52512\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-sees-top-keepers-in-pair-of-games-this-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52512\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-sees-top-keepers-in-pair-of-games-this-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-sees-top-keepers-in-pair-of-games-this-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-sees-top-keepers-in-pair-of-games-this-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-sees-top-keepers-in-pair-of-games-this-weekend/","id":1609,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1608,1607,1606],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Soccer: Back on Top","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.6.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-8.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.6.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-8.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"No. 3 UCSB travels to UC Davis","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Off to its best start in conference play since 2009, the No. 3 UCSB men’s soccer team, leaders atop the Big West North Division will travel to UC Davis on Saturday in its first matchup against a division foe.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara enters Saturday with a 9-4 overall and a 4-0 Big West record after winning five-straight matches with a chance to extend its two game lead over Davis who sits second in the North Division at 6-6-1 overall and 2-2 in conference.</p>\n<p>“We just have to find a way to win the game; we don’t care how it happens,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Ever since the New Mexico and Stanford games where we found ways to lose, we’ve matured a little bit, gotten better.

Two weeks ago McNeely was named Big West Defensive Player of the Week, an honor awarded to senior defender Peter Schmetz on Monday, as Gauchos have owned the award the past two weeks.</p>\n<p>“From the start our goal has been to win our conference and after that the goal would be to win the conference tournament,” McNeely said. “Going beyond that, getting to the final four and far in playoffs would be a big step for the program.”</p>\n<p>Headlining the Gaucho offense is senior forward Achille Campion, who leads the team and ranks tied for fifth in the conference with five goals scored on the season. Senior midfielder Goffin Boyoko ranks right behind Campion with four goals this season.</p>\n<p>Aiding the two seniors are a pair of freshmen in midfielder Drew Murphy and forward Ismaila Jome. Murphy’s six assists this season rank tied for first in the Big West, while Jome’s five tie for fourth.</p>\n<p>The Aggies enter Saturday fresh off a 2-0 victory over Riverside, a win that ended a two-game skid in conference play.</p>\n<p>“The stats kind of tell it all for Davis. What that tells you is they can beat anybody … but then they can also lose to anybody,” Vom Steeg said. “They don’t give up a lot and they don’t get a lot and that’s a recipe for a low-scoring game, which we have been fortunate in the last two games to find a way to win. Hopefully we can do that again on Saturday.”</p>\n<p>Davis, a team known for low-scoring affairs, has scored a mere 10 goals in 13 games this season, tied for second-fewest in the Big West. Similarly, the Aggies have allowed only 11 goals this season, tied with UCSB for the fewest in the conference.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ranks third in the Big West with 20 goals scored this season as they struggled to put the ball in the back of the net early in the season. In the last four games, however, the Gauchos have scored at least two goals in every game, once putting up three in a victory over Fullerton.</p>\n<p>One key to the game may be how effectively the Gauchos can attack a stout Aggies’ defense and put a ball between the posts. Factoring in Davis’ inability to score and the Gauchos’ knack for shutting opponents down, Santa Barbara may be on its way to taking a three-game lead in the Big West north if it can score an early goal on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“We are now playing the teams in our own division and these are now six-point swings,” Vom Steeg said. “Either we jump ahead three games or we go back down to one game.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s kickoff is scheduled for 3 p.m. at Aggie Soccer Field.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em> A version of this article appeared on page 1 of October 17th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52506\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-soccer-back-on-top/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52506\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-soccer-back-on-top/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-soccer-back-on-top/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-soccer-back-on-top/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-soccer-back-on-top/","id":1611,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1610,1609,1608],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
