Levine’s research is based on an experiment in which he gave sheets presenting the issue of climate change to different subject groups with varying degrees of urgency and observed which participants chose to sign a petition in support of political action on climate change. He found those who received more personalized, urgent information were less likely to want to engage in a solution.</p>\n<p>Levine said people become less willing to conserve resources when climate change is presented as an urgent, personalized issue.</p>\n<p>“It might have cognitive consequences which might decrease the belief that because the really important goal is difficult to achieve, perhaps what I need to do is conserve my resources to focus on those goals,” Levine said. “What we are finding is that seemingly helpful rhetoric can backfire in [a] really important and consequential way, and that it is important to highlight that,” Levine said.</p>\n<p>Bren Environmental Science and Management (EMS) graduate student Michelle Graff said Levine’s research contradicted her preexisting ideas.</p>\n<p>“It is a belief that you should make things more personal because somebody can find those connections,” Graff said. “So I did think it was really interesting that sometimes that actually does the exact opposite.”</p>\n<p>According to Graff, using fear tactics to motivate people to act on environmental issues is ineffective.</p>\n<p>“There has generally been a shift in climate change communication to it being a doomsday kind of thing,” Graff said. “It will be difficult, but there are ways to approach it in a manageable way — more of focusing on people’s ability of what they can get done.”</p>\n<p>Bren EMS graduate student Tova Handelman said Levine’s research reveals why people are often pessimistic about environmental issues.</p>\n<p>“Maybe one of the reasons that the messaging against climate change has been so effective [is] because it kind of gives people the option to not do anything about it” Handelman said.</p>\n<p>Sierra Club member Robert Bernstein said Levine’s research is “priceless.”</p>\n<p>“Somebody has actually done evidential research on what it is that motivates people to do environmental action,” Bernstein said.</p><div

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Associate Professor of Sociology at Indiana University Dina Okamoto gave a lecture titled “Asian American Panethnicity and Shifting Ethnic Boundaries” Thursday at the MultiCultural Center (MCC) to discuss Asian-American identity throughout history.</p>\n<p>Okamoto spoke about Asian ethnic groups in the United States and how various social and cultural forces led to the creation of the panethnic Asian-American group, a term and identity used to describe Americans from all Asian backgrounds.</p>\n<p>According to Okamoto, Asian ethnic groups in America did not organize to form a shared panethnic identity until 1968.</p>\n<p>“Before 1968, the legal identity of Asian Americans was divided, with representatives from China, Japan, Korea,” Okamoto said. “They didn’t form alliances — instead they formed their own separate ethnic communities with their own systems of social assistance and support, and at times they intentionally distinguished themselves from one another.”</p>\n<p>Okamoto also said there are a variety of differences between Asian ethnic groups, preventing the formation of a unified group prior to 1968. According to Okamoto, social, religious and economic factors contributed to separations between Asian immigrant groups in America.</p>\n<p>“They spoke different languages; they brought different cultural traditions with them from their homeland; they also practiced different religions. This is something that still happens today,” Okamoto said. “I would also argue that during this period different ethnic groups didn’t work together in the fields … because they arrived in successive waves to the United States. When one group fell out of favor, another group came to meet the labor demand.”</p>\n<p>According to Okamoto, a new Asian-American identity formed in the 1960s when Asian-Americans sought involvement in the black power movement, the anti-war movement and protests at UC Berkeley and San Francisco State for ethnic studies programs.</p>\n<p>“Asian American students and community activists began to realize their unique position and perspective, and they created an identity that encompassed all Asian origin groups,” Okamoto said. “They rejected the label ‘oriental’ because it represented the European colonialist view and instead adopted the identity of Asian-American.”</p>\n<p>Okamoto said the creation of a panethnic group like Asian-American does not replace individual ethnic groups such as Chinese and Korean-Americans.</p>\n<p>“I argue that when panethnicity occurs — when ethnic backgrounds expand to other groups and an all encompassing identity — this doesn’t necessarily mean that boundaries have been displaced or attenuated,” Okamoto said. “Instead, the boundaries can have a layered quality where multiple identities can coexist and even be complimentary.”</p>\n<p>According to Okamoto, the creation of panethnic groups allows immigrant groups to build new, powerful communities.</p>\n<p>“By trying to alter widely agreed-upon racial categories through organizing, Asian-Americans have attempted to change the meaning of these racial categories,” Okamoto said. “By doing this, immigrant groups can create new forms of community and identity and can call for shifts in the current distribution of resources.”</p>\n<p>MCC program director Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said Okamoto was invited to the MCC’s “Race Matters” series to emphasize a theme of intersectionality and bring a new perspective to the MCC.</p>\n<p>“The logic of the ‘Race Matters’ series is to bring a diverse group of academic experts working in various fields that intersect with race in one form or another,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “We wanted a representative from the Asian-American community to bring diversity and variance to the MCC, and Dina Okamoto’s work is very cutting edge, and she’s an incredible sociologist.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Arpan Singh said she enjoyed hearing about Asian-American involvement in the 1960s protest movement.</p>\n<p>“I liked how she explained the different perspectives in the protest movement,” Singh said.</p>\n<p>Graduate student Annie Hikido said issues of Asian American identity are especially relevant in California.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really important, particularly in California, [which] does have an incredibly large Asian American population that is increasing both as a general race and as the ethnicities within it,” Hikido said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

emotional issue. <em>Andrew Gates/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB Students for Life of America hosted an event titled the “The Abortion Debate” between pro-choice UCSB professor of philosophy Quentin Gee and pro-life author Trent Horn to discuss abortion and women’s reproductive rights in the United States.</p>\n<p>Horn is the author of pro-life book Persuasive Pro-Life: How to Talk About Our Culture’s Toughest Issue, which claims to equip readers with the knowledge to be “a bold and effective apologist for the unborn.” Gee’s current research focuses on collective responsibility and the topic’s relation to ethical, political and legal philosophy. The debate format followed a 15-minute opening speech, 10-minute rebuttal and an eight-minute cross examination for each participant and ended with an audience Q&amp;A session. Ph.D. candidate in philosophy Keith Hess moderated the debate.</p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">Opening the evening’s discussion, Gee said debates at universities cannot be based on religious dogma and should instead pursue a “practically available, publically moral status” for the issue. Gee then posed a hypothetical “thought experiment” about the ethicality of aborting fetuses.</p>\n<p>“If you were in a fertility clinic which was about to burn down, and you could save one infant in basket or save 10,000 embryos in cold storage, I doubt anyone would vote to save the embryos.”</p>\n<p>According to Gee, the “cutoff line” for permissible abortion can operate at 23 weeks gestational age. Gee said although it is a contentious issue, the fetus cannot commonly feel pain at this stage.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it is necessarily wrong afterwards, but as a precaution to avoid a potential problem,” Gee said.</p>\n<p>Gee said those who factor religious reasoning into the abortion debate lack knowledge of embryotic life.</p>\n<p>“If you do in fact think the embryo has same status as baby, approximately 50 percent of embryos fail to lead to full pregnancy because of an inability to implant to the uterine wall,” Gee said. “By this logic, if you don’t think God is the number one baby death enabler, death is not indicative of the status of a fetus.”</p>\n<p>Gee said the core of his argument is that a fetus’s conceivable rights do not hold precedence to a woman’s rights in controlling her body.</p>\n<p>“A fetus and newborn baby, even if they have interests, doesn’t mean they trump all other interests,” Gee said. “I think it is possible for a woman to say ‘I cannot take care of this baby’ … it wouldn’t be looked upon well … but I think this is permissible.”</p>\n<p>In his introductory statement, Horn said it is generally wrong to directly kill innocent human beings, that fetuses are innocent human beings and that it is therefore wrong to kill fetuses.</p>\n<p>Horn then showed a series of photographs of fetuses at various stages of development from eight weeks to 22 weeks. According to Horn, abortion is the killing of a human being.</p>\n<p>“Abortion is not a passive removal of life, it is the act of killing a child via dismemberment,” Horn said. “It’s like giving someone a kidney and then ripping it out, killing him or her in a violent process.”</p>\n<p>Horn said because a fetus is a human with potential for growth, it follows that the fetus has the basic right to not be killed.</p>\n<p>“Saying an unborn is inhuman because it is just a fetus is like saying a 15-year-old is not a human because they are just a teenager,” Horn said.</p>\n<p>According to Horn, subjecting fetuses to a non-human status based on their inability to feel pain is an act of “ableism,” a form of discrimination based on stigmatizing disability. Horn also said Gee’s “thought experiment” is unfounded because logical decisions cannot be based on intuition.</p>\n<p>“My position is unborn [fetuses] are human organisms; all humans should have basic human rights regardless of their functional ability,” Horn said, “Just because we have different intuitions at different times doesn’t mean we should rely on our feelings. Instead, let’s look toward rational arguments.”</p>\n<p>The cross examination portion of the debate contrasted Horn’s requirement for a definition of personhood with Gee’s assertion that intuition plays a role in deciding the moral worth of a human in any stage.</p>\n<p>Gee said rather than a definition of personhood, the moral state of a fetus involves a “cluster of requirements.”</p>\n<p>“There is some sort of mental concept, no possibility for a rich mental life. It involves a conscious interest and desire to keep living,” Gee said.</p>\n<p>In response, Horn said a fetus does not need to consciously demonstrate its desire for life in order to be considered viable for the right of life.</p>\n<p>“I think you can have an interest in living without consciously alluding to it, because the zygote — there is some element of an interest in its living in terms of growth,” Horn said.</p>\n<p>Horn and Gee began the Q&amp;A portion of the event by responding to the question of what would motivate the two participants to change their stance on the topic of abortion.</p>\n<p>Horn said he would require an argument separating the worth of humans with those of children.</p>\n<p>“I could be moved to change my mind if it could be shown that all human beings don’t have equal rights … that they don’t really have a right to live in the organ designed for them,” Horn said.</p>\n<p>Gee said he would change his position if a fetus was shown to have certain mental capabilities.</p>\n<p>“I would require something on the order of showing that the organism in question has a deep, fairly rich mental life,” Gee said. “I think if you could show that, we could be concerned with killing the life.”</p>\n<p>In a closing statement, Gee said he would like to reassert his claim that a fetus’s rights should not be considered with more weight than a woman’s “deeply personal” autonomy over her own body.</p>\n<p>“While there is some value for whichever stage the zygote or fetus is in, I don’t think it is a value that trumps a woman’s right to bodily integrity,” Gee said. “If there was a body that had the same moral status as you and me, then there would be more value.”</p>\n<p>In Horn’s closing statement, he said humans should be defined and valued by their membership in a social community rather than their functional capabilities.</p>\n<p>“Human beings should be valued not for their functions, but because they belong to this community. I think an important question tonight is ‘Who are we allowed to kill?’” Horn said. “We should have a pit in our stomach regardless of whether it is a child or a fetus, because in the end, they all have the same intrinsic potential.”</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Delaney Forester said she wanted to further understand Horn’s position.</p>\n<p>“Horn made a comment earlier about a biological parent’s inherent responsibility to take care of a child unless they are deemed unfit,” Forester said. “My question is, what is the deciding factor in what makes you unfit?”</p>\n<p>Hess said the audience contributed to a civil and constructive debate, allowing both speakers to properly assert their views.</p>\n<p>“I liked how the students kept it civil. There wasn’t any … hot-heads or name-calling so I think this is the way that debates should be done,” Hess said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Students for Life of America President and fourth-year economics major Katie Devlin said the event was successful in fostering a productive discussion on the controversial topic of abortion.</p>\n<p>“I thought both speakers did a wonderful job. The audience also had really good questions,” Devlin said. “It was great how we could have a civil conversation about this sometimes controversial topic.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on

emergency contraceptive company Plan B One-Step Thursday in front of the UCen to educate students about various birth control options.</p>\n<p>The “Perfectly Imperfect” initiative serves to promote the emergency contraceptive Plan B One-Step through events held at college campuses throughout the country. At UCSB’s event, students had the chance to learn information about various contraceptive options, participate in a photo booth and interact with MTV series “Girl Code” celebrities Carly Aquilino and Nessa Diab. Aquilino, Diab and Obstetrician and Gynecologist Dr. Diana Ramos spoke about the campaign and Plan B One-Step, followed by a Q&amp;A session at a media event in the Flying A Room of the UCen.</p>\n<p>Third-year feminist studies and sociology double major Kevin Tang said he is happy to see a campus event on sexual education.</p>\n<p>“I think that it’s really good that it’s on campus because I feel like our country just doesn’t give people the sex education that they need, so I think it’s a good resource to be on campus,” Tang said.</p>\n<p>Third-year communication and global studies double major Natasha Mehrdad said Her Campus’s involvement in the campaign emphasized the theme of female empowerment.</p>\n<p>“The fact that Her Campus is involved with all of it brings back the whole feminist ‘girl power’ vibe to it,” Mehrdad said. “They are all so open and welcoming and all that stuff. Like, I wanted to get involved, too, and they’re just so welcoming with open arms.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65714\" style=\"width: 459px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Her-Campus_Jenny-LUo-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"765595074\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65710\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65714\" data-attachment-id=\"65714\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/her-campus-hosts-perfectly-imperfect-to-promote-plan-b-body-positivity/her-campus_jenny-luo-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Her-Campus_Jenny-LUo-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 6D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1445477612\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"32\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Her Campus_Jenny LUo-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Her-Campus_Jenny-LUo-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Her-Campus_Jenny-LUo-3.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-65714\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Her-Campus_Jenny-LUo-3-1024x682.jpg?resize=449%2C299\" alt=\"Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus\" width=\"449\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Her-Campus_Jenny-LUo-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Her-Campus_Jenny-LUo-3.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Her-Campus_Jenny-LUo-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Her-Campus_Jenny-LUo-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65714\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>According to Tang, society criticizes imperfections that should instead be celebrated.</p>\n<p>“I think our society pressures people to think they’re imperfect, especially young women,” Tang said. “I think everyone has something special — something great about them, and that’s to be celebrated instead of putting that down.”</p>\n<p>Third-year communication major Erica Valbusa said students need to hear that that having imperfections is normal.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s cool because in college you strive to be the best, but there are some setbacks, so this kind of reassures you that not everyone is perfect and it’s ok, so embrace it and there are ways to help you get there,” Valbusa said.</p>\n<p>According to Dr. Ramos, the emergency contraceptive Plan B One-Step is not an abortion pill but an option for when other forms of contraception fail. Dr. Ramos said the active ingredient in the Plan B One-Step is levonorgestrel, a manufactured hormone in a class of medications called progestins.</p>\n<p>“87 percent of the women’s survey believe that emergency contraception will harm the existing pregnancy, and the reality is it will not — as a matter of fact, it helps prevent a pregnancy,” Dr. Ramos said. “So, it’s really important to realize that it works similar to the way birth control [works], but you’ve got one hormone at a much higher dose, so it is not an abortive agent.”</p>\n<p>Diab said it is important to make self-image decisions based off of facts and evidence, not societal pressures.</p>\n<p>“We live in a world right now where we’re being judged all the time — there’s so much pressure from day to day,” Diab said. “When you have this pressure to constantly be perfect, you might make decisions based off pressure and … that’s why it’s important to be true to yourself … to be prepared for situations like this and to accept the fact that we’re not perfect.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65710\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/her-campus-hosts-perfectly-imperfect-to-promote-plan-b-body-positivity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65710\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/her-campus-hosts-perfectly-imperfect-to-promote-plan-b-body-positivity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/her-campus-hosts-perfectly-imperfect-to-promote-plan-b-body-positivity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/her-campus-hosts-perfectly-imperfect-to-promote-plan-b-body-positivity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/her-campus-hosts-perfectly-imperfect-to-promote-plan-b-body-positivity/","id":2643,"author":{"id":115,"name":"Sierra Deak"},"related":[2642,2641,2640],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
