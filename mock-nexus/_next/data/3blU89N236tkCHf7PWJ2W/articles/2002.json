She was just being courteous. But UC Santa Barbara anthropology professor Manasendu Kundu didn’t realize this initially.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How naïve I was ⁠— how different American culture was from Indian culture,” he said, recounting how, following his arrival to the United States from India in 1982, he had reacted to a woman in the airport who smiled at him in passing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I got confused. In my country, unknown men and women do not smile at each other. In certain quarters of my city, there are women who look at men and smile to have them as their customers,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I thought, ‘Oh my god.’ And then I did a bad thing. I gave her a very harsh look as if to say, ‘Look lady, I am not that kind of person.

Kundu wrote a scathing response, and, not knowing what to do with his paper, began sending it to various professors at several American universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To his surprise, some professors got back to him and liked what he had written. At the end of a reply, one professor even invited Kundu to apply for graduate school and study under him in the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That professor was Mattison Mines, who taught anthropology at UCSB from 1970 to 2005. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I pinched myself,” Kundu said, recalling the invitation from Mines. “He is my guru.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Kundu arrived in Santa Barbara for graduate school in 1982, he was primarily interested in the modernization of agriculture, population studies and the Green Revolution in India.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until Kundu was fully immersed in the environmental studies circles at UCSB that he began to see the darker sides of what he was studying — how human behavior and modern agriculture were negatively affecting the environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Mankind’s] connection to environmental degradation … I had no idea until I came here. At the time, that conversation was not happening in India. Everyone was still thinking of how good the Green Revolution was, thinking they had found the solution,” Kundu said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the late 1980s, nearing the completion of his Ph.D., Kundu applied for a lecturer position in the environmental studies department and was subsequently accepted. However, he realized that he hadn’t quite considered the dilemma of whether to return to India or stay in the United States. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had no interest in leaving India permanently. My parents were there, my in-laws, my wife. But I couldn’t leave Santa Barbara either. I fell in love. It is this lifelong love with this campus, its students, its faculty members.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To resolve his problem, Kundu worked out a deal with the department to teach only a couple quarters a year, eventually transitioning to only teaching in the summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu’s first official quarter teaching at UCSB was the winter of 1988. He hasn’t stopped since. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This summer marks his 32nd consecutive year of returning to Santa Barbara from India to teach both environmental studies and anthropology classes including Environmental Studies 132: Human Behavior and Global Environment and Anthropology 148: Ecological Anthropology.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu’s interest in anthropology and the environment began in ninth grade after he attended a village boarding school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There, I came to know the villagers, the farmers. I was born in a city and I had never seen a paddy field before,” Kundu said. “I noticed that these families had a different culture, and I became interested in their lives, the farmers’ lives. It made a deep impact on me.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu was one of the early scholars to approach environmental studies from an anthropological perspective, looking at how the development of human societies and cultures is affecting the environment today. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu wants students to understand that “our own consumption is at the root of the environmental crisis,” noting that during a flight from Japan to the U.S., he received a bottle of water from the Swiss Alps. He lamented the use of resources required to bring the water from Switzerland to Japan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What is the purpose? Was there water scarcity in Japan? I did some research, and no, there’s no water scarcity. The airline wanted to show that they cared about us or something like that. Yet what is the impact? Unless we understand this, we will not be able to change it. Technology is only part of the solution. We need a behavioral solution as well. A change in perspective. That is my key message for students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year biological anthropology major Ana Perez, who is currently taking Anthropology 148: Ecological Anthropology with Kundu, said she appreciates the substance and methodology of Professor Kundu’s teaching.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “When he talked about being one of the first people to actually consider putting environmental studies and anthropology together… I didn’t even think of putting those two together. I hope that more people taking his classes decide to pursue environmental anthropology,” Perez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s awesome that he travels the world for this, and I wish more people had the opportunity to take his courses.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Kundu is grateful for his unique career, it is not without downsides. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you have two homes, you are always homesick,” Kundu said. While in Santa Barbara, it is hard not to miss his wife and family in India. However, he said that friends like Debjani Bhattacharya, a financial analyst at UCSB’s Earth Research Institute, help with that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Really, wherever you go outside of India, there will be an Indian diaspora. We met here 17 years ago through a group of friends,” Bhattacharya said. It just so happened that the two were born and raised in the same state in India, West Bengal, and attended the same university for their undergraduate studies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we go back to India, we visit each other’s families, and we have become family friends.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two friends, along with other colleagues, like to get together to cook traditional Indian meals and take walks on Del Playa Drive. Once, during an evening Del Playa walk, some students approached their group and asked Kundu if he was the chancellor of UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without skipping a beat, Kundu replied, “Not yet.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for what the future holds for Kundu, he welcomes more of the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Teaching is my religion. It’s not just my profession. If I wished, I could retire, but I’m not going to retire,” Kundu said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As long as my family will allow, as long as these two departments will allow, as long as my physical abilities are good… I will continue to teach.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [7/28]: A previous version of this article said that Kundu was a full faculty member in the Department of Anthropology. Kundu works as a lecturer during summer sessions. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89400\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-27/anthropology-professor-celebrates-32nd-consecutive-summer-traveling-across-the-world-to-teach-at-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89400\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-27/anthropology-professor-celebrates-32nd-consecutive-summer-traveling-across-the-world-to-teach-at-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-27/anthropology-professor-celebrates-32nd-consecutive-summer-traveling-across-the-world-to-teach-at-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-27/anthropology-professor-celebrates-32nd-consecutive-summer-traveling-across-the-world-to-teach-at-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-27/anthropology-professor-celebrates-32nd-consecutive-summer-traveling-across-the-world-to-teach-at-ucsb/","id":2002,"author":{"id":58,"name":"Alex Bumpers"},"related":[2001,2000,1999],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":58,"name":"Alex Bumpers","biography":"Not available","articles":[2002,2014,4149],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Battle of the QB’s: Omaha Meets “The Dab”","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/campeyton.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/campeyton.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sports Editor Michael Jorgenson and Assistant Sports Editor Sean White choose sides for Sunday's Super Bowl 50 matchup.

This tends to be extremely misleading, especially in sports where numbers don’t quite translate to show a player’s true value.</p>\n<p>When comparing careers as a whole, we generally stick to one golden rule when talking about what number matters most: rings.</p>\n<p>Dan Marino is perhaps the most well-known example in football of how misleading this can be, as the legendary quarterback failed to ever win a ring despite setting just about every passing record there was to set. He would forever be overshadowed by Joe Montana and his four Super Bowl rings, a record for quarterbacks that still stands today.</p>\n<p>It’s not hard to see who the present-day equivalents of Marino and Montana are. Peyton Manning and Tom Brady have followed the same storyline as their predecessors nearly to the tee since they rose to prominence in the early 2000s.</p>\n<p>Brady quickly took up the Montana role, racking up three rings from 2001-2004 as the Patriots dominated the football world with unprecedented postseason success. Over the years, he has made his own individual marks on the record books, albeit nowhere close to the success Manning has had in that respect. However, a fourth Super Bowl win in 2015 brought Brady into a tie with Montana and Terry Bradshaw for the most ever for quarterbacks, further establishing him as potentially the greatest signal-caller of all time.</p>\n<p>On the other side, no matter how well Peyton Manning has done in the regular season, postseason success has almost always found a way to evade him. Whether it’s due to costly interceptions, missed field goals, or freak plays down the stretch, Peyton has managed a 13-13 career playoff record and the most losses of any quarterback, compared to Brady’s magnificent mark of 22-9.</p>\n<p>The key difference between Manning and Marino in the playoffs is the fact that Manning did manage to pull off one Cinderella run in 2006, when his Indianapolis Colts defeated the Chicago Bears 29-17 on a rainy day in Miami. Nevertheless, as he continued rewriting the history books and bringing his MVP tally to an all-time best mark of five, Manning still could never find a way to erase the doubts of his greatness.</p>\n<p>After all, Peyton’s little brother, Eli, who has never come close in the statistics argument, has two rings of his own; ironically, both having been earned against Brady and the Patriots.</p>\n<p>It is too late for Peyton to reach the mark set by Brady and Montana, but this Sunday, his legacy will have everything on the line. Lose, and he likely finishes his career with a 1-3 record in Super Bowls, more evidence for the doubters that more times than not, he failed to get the job done when it mattered most.</p>\n<p>Win, and he gets a John Elway-like send off, potentially ending his career on the highest note possible while finally getting that elusive second ring.</p>\n<p>Ironically, if Peyton wins that second ring, he would be achieving it during what is by far the worst statistical year of his legendary career.</p>\n<p>Just how bad was it? Excluding the 2011 season which he sat out due to multiple neck surgeries, Peyton finished 2015 with the least completions, yards, touchdowns, QB rating and games played of his career. In a game against Cleveland, he broke the all-time record for passing yards minutes before being benched for the first time ever. That was his season in a nutshell.</p>\n<p>Although he was on the field far less than we are accustomed to, when he did play, mistakes were in abundance. He averaged 1.7 interceptions per game, the most since his rookie season, when he averaged 1.75.</p>\n<p>Luckily for Peyton, he gets one more chance to win a ring thanks to the greatest defense he has ever had behind him, a defense that won the Broncos the No. 1 seed in the AFC despite playing with an inconsistent offense that is still searching for  answers.</p>\n<p>Peyton knows better than anyone in this game how defense can win a championship. It was only two years ago that the greatest offensive season in history was demolished 43-8 by the Seattle Seahawks and the league’s top defensive unit.</p>\n<p>It’d be a shame to see him go down like that one more time. Fortunately for his fans, he has looked spryer than he has all season in his last couple performances, looking to have put the plantar fasciitis that forced him to miss time behind him.</p>\n<p>Whatever happens, this Sunday will be a day to remember in the legendary story of Peyton Manning, football’s greatest student.</p>\n<p>Let’s just hope the referee doesn’t ruin things with a controversial coin toss.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67920\" style=\"width: 488px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67920\" data-attachment-id=\"67920\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/battle-of-the-qbs-omaha-meets-the-dab/2016-2-2-football/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?fit=1200%2C900&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,900\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2016 2 2 football\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-67920\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?resize=478%2C359\" alt=\"Emily Zhang/ Daily Nexus\" width=\"478\" height=\"359\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-2-2-football.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67920\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Emily Zhang/ Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Panther’s Balanced Attack Could Ensure Last Rodeo of Manning Era </strong></p>\n<p><strong>By Sean White</strong></p>\n<p>Despite becoming the first team to win the NFC South in back-to-back seasons last year, Carolina’s 7-8-1 finish to crawl into the playoffs was not an astounding achievement as each team in the division concluded the season with a losing record.</p>\n<p>As part of a mediocre division along with the losses of No. 1 Wide Receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn left ACL and a farewell to nine-year veteran Halfback DeAngelo Williams, ending the Panthers’ coveted dual-threat rushing attack alongside Johnathan Stewart, many were convinced that a lackluster season was in store for Carolina.</p>\n<p>But just like the fearless superhero he has constantly portrayed himself to be, the heroic breakout season of Panthers’ Quarterback Cam Newton has amazed the entire National Football League with his incomparable play on the field to help the Panthers finish with a 15-1 regular season record.</p>\n<p>With “Super Cam” at the helm, it may not be too early for Coach Rivera to consider which finger he will have fitted for his second Super Bowl ring. Yet, it can be assured that the primary objective is earning Carolina its first of the famed piece of jewelry.</p>\n<p>The same applies for Newton, who is in search of his first Super Bowl ring and has helped guide the Carolina Panthers to their second Super Bowl appearance in franchise history. While a Panthers-Patriots rematch of Super Bowl XXXVIII would have made the headlines ever more intriguing for Sunday’s game, the opportunity to see Newton play on the game’s most remarkable stage is just as fascinating.</p>\n<p>He set regular season career-highs in passing touchdowns and passer rating with 35 and 99.4 percent, respectively, while throwing a career-low 10 interceptions. Newton complemented his attack through the air with his rushing abilities as well, registering a career-high 8.2 rush attempts per game while collecting 636 yards and 10 rushing touchdowns.</p>\n<p>While it’s inevitable to dislike the charismatic celebrations and giveaways of footballs to children in the crowd after scoring a touchdown, there remains a lack of attention to the level of proficiency he has consistently played with all season long.</p>\n<p>Specifically, his reliability in the Panthers’ redzone trips on offense have been overlooked. He ranked third in the NFL during the regular season when in opponents’ redzone, throwing for 26 touchdowns and zero interceptions. Nonetheless, Newton has performed best in the fourth quarter of games, registering a 64.3 completion percentage and a 110.4 quarterback rating.</p>\n<p>Just like the calm, cool and collected persona that the QB displays, he has been a vital element in the Panthers’ success on third down helping to extend offensive drives. Carolina’s 42.4 third down conversion percentage ranked seventh in the NFL during the regular season. The Panthers’ offense has increased their efficiency when facing possible three and out situations in the postseason now at a 55.2 percentage.</p>\n<p>If I had the privilege of voting for this year’s MVP it would be in favor of Newton, however, I remain a firm believer in the old adage that ‘defense wins championships.’</p>\n<p>Though Carolina ranked a few spots lower than Denver in total defense, pass yards allowed and rush yards allowed, the Panthers’ mastery of takeaways provides the best balance to their dynamic offense.</p>\n<p>Carolina led the NFL with a plus-20 differential between its takeaways and giveaways. Its defense led the league with a total of 39 takeaways while also garnering league-highs in interceptions with 24 and fumble recoveries with 15.</p>\n<p>Leading the Panthers’ stout defense is three-time First Team All-Pro Middle Linebacker Luke Kuechly. Assisting in either run defense or pass coverage alongside veteran linebacker Thomas Davis, it is Kuechly’s versatility that makes him such a challenge for offenses to gameplan against.</p>\n<p>Supporting Kuechly and the rest of the linebacking core are the members of “Thieves Ave”— the Panthers’ secondary. Led by arguably the best defensive back in the NFL in Josh Norman, the crew is responsible for 15 of the team’s 24 interceptions with safety Kurt Coleman’s seven being tied for the most in the NFC.</p>\n<p>Although Peyton Manning has yet to throw an interception this postseason, the time shall come once he squares off against the Panthers’ defense. Carolina’s defense is predicated around the foundation of takeaways, having already recorded six interceptions and two fumbles in two playoff games.</p>\n<p>In addition to Manning throwing at least one interception in each of his three previous Super Bowl trips, there has been just one season in which Peyton has threw less than 10 interceptions.</p>\n<p>That lone season ended with a Super Bowl victory over the Chicago Bears with the Indianapolis Colts during the years of 2006-07. Certainly I’m not inferring that the Broncos can’t win because of this statistic, yet the Panthers’ ball hawing defense may be able to prey upon Peyton’s weakest element which could end with Carolina bringing home the Lombardi Trophy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of February 4, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67896\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/battle-of-the-qbs-omaha-meets-the-dab/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67896\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/battle-of-the-qbs-omaha-meets-the-dab/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/battle-of-the-qbs-omaha-meets-the-dab/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/battle-of-the-qbs-omaha-meets-the-dab/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/battle-of-the-qbs-omaha-meets-the-dab/","id":1999,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1998,1997,1996],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UC Student Governments Call for Divestment of Thirty Meter Telescope Project","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-09-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Convocation-by-Christina-DeMarzo-online-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Convocation-by-Christina-DeMarzo-online-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The letter asks the UC to cease funding for TMT and for any faculty or staff working on the project to “speak out against the exploitation of Mauna Kea.” ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Wednesday afternoon, the University of California Student Association, which represents students across all UC campuses, released a letter signed by all nine Associated Students External Vice Presidents demanding the UC cut financial ties with the Thirty Meter Telescope project.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The call for divestment comes two months after students across the UC system </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-07-22/students-condemn-uc-and-chancellor-yangs-involvement-in-thirty-meter-telescope-express-support-for-native-hawaiians/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">began raising their voices</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in opposition to the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT).

law – several times over.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other four other lawsuits filed against the department, </span><a

All of these lawsuits also allege violations of the Whistleblower Act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stern’s complaint stems from the alleged ignoring of several reported cases of misconduct that began in late 2015, and is mainly centered around five other officers: former Officer Josh Rothermel, former Officer Jeff Savaglio, former Officer Ryan Smith, Officer David Millard and Officer Amanda Siegel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the lawsuit, Stern says he raised concerns about two fellow officers – Rothermel and Savaglio, who are also mentioned in the other lawsuits – in late 2015, alleging they were “causing safety risks” by not responding to requests for backup, turning off radios and not answering phone calls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After speaking with the two about his concerns, Stern alleges he was approached by Smith, who told him that Stern’s concerns about Rothermel and Savaglio were “not valid” and threatened to write him up for “speaking with an officer under Smith’s command.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This would mark the first of several interactions with Smith regarding officer misconduct; beginning June 2016, Stern alleges Smith gave Rothermel, Savaglio and Siegel preferential treatment. Additionally, as detailed in other suits, Siegel was alleged to be having an extramarital affair with Smith. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stern said that any attempt to address concerns with the three’s behavior – Rothermel and Savaglio’s alleged safety risks and Siegel’s capabilities as an officer – was met with threats from Smith to write Stern up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Less than a year later, in February 2017, Stern alleges he was accused by outside investigators looking into the department of knowing about Rothermel and Savaglio’s “improper conduct,” but failing “to notify a proper supervisor.” He then informed investigators that he had reported the two officers’ conduct to Smith and that Smith had allegedly threatened him in response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the following months, Stern says he was demoted from his position as corporal “without any explanation,” was not chosen for another qualified position and was excluded from receiving an award for his actions during the </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2017/02/01/milo-yiannopoulos-event-canceled-violent-protests-erupt-uc-berkeley/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley riots</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and during the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-15/santa-barbara-community-mourns-lives-lost-in-montecito-mudslides/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Montecito mudslides</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. According to court documents, Stern believes this was because he told investigators about Smith’s alleged misconduct. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from complaints about Smith, Stern also lists several allegations against his superior Millard – who is named as a defendant in the suit, alongside the UC Regents – in court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Stern, Millard allegedly lied on a university audit, ordered a dispatcher to lie to a member of the public, mismanaged the release of a trainee officer, “lacked leader and management abilities” and “refused to address issues related to retaliation against officers who made protected disclosures.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stern additionally alleges that on Aug. 19, 2018, after he reported to Millard that other UCPD officers were “legitimately in fear of Smith,” Millard dismissed Stern’s concerns and refused to “address harassment concerns of his fellow officers.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Millard, like Smith, is also named in the other recent UCPD lawsuits. Stern and the plaintiffs of the other lawsuits accuse Millard of covering for Smith, Savagalio and Rothermel’s behavior. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith has not worked with the UCPD since December 2017; he filed his own lawsuit under the pseudonym John Doe against the department in March 2019, alleging that he was harassed and retailed against by his fellow officers for reporting a number of behaviors within the department. His suit detailed alleged police mockery of Chancellor Henry T. Yang, fellow officers and sexual assault and rape victims by members of the department, as well as racial discrimination and the falsification of sexual assault reports.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stern is being represented by the same lawyers representing the Littles, Signa and Reyes. He is scheduled to appear in court again in December. </span></p>\n<p>“Officer Stern filed for the same reasons his fellow officers have, because the UCSBPD and UC Regents fostered an environment of endemic discrimination,” Stern’s lawyer Antonio Castillo said in an email.</p>\n<p>“He filed because it’s long overdue that the UCSB and UC Regents take responsibility for the harm they allowed to occur.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
