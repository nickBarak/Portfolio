San Diego was the only team to improve its overall record which is now 14-21 after a 4-1 mark at the tournament.</p>\n<p>Friday was UCSB’s best day with back to back wins against both Santa Clara and Seattle. In an eight inning game against Santa Clara, the Gauchos found themselves down 4-0 after five innings of play.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara finally woke up in the sixth inning scoring three runs to cut the deficit to one at 4-3. UCSB was able to hold Santa Clara scoreless for the next two innings, while scoring one run in each to earn the 5-4 win.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Lena Mayor and freshman Veronika Gulvin split the pitching duties against Santa Clara with four innings each and both earning four strikeouts in the process. Gulvin secured the win, now 5-8 on the season, after giving up only one run on two hits.</p>\n<p>After struggling through a 2-0 loss against Seattle the day before, the Gauchos got back on the winning track when it beat Seattle 6-3. UCSB out hit Seattle 13-6 with three Gauchos contributing two hits each.</p>\n<p>Junior infielder Kristen Clark scored three runs on the day, while sophomore right fielder Jessica Johnston went 2-3 (.666) with both hits being extra-base hits and knocked in four runs.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos started the game by scoring two runs right off the bat, however, Seattle responded in the second with two runs of its own to make it 2-2. Johnston responded to Seattle’s two-run comeback with a single to right field, knocking in Clark and junior outfielder Stacy Cavazos to make the score 4-2.</p>\n<p>Seattle would add one run in the third inning to make the score 4-3, but two more runs by Santa Barbara in the fourth inning put the game away as it secured its 6-3 victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s final game on Saturday against San Diego was a frustrating finish for the Gauchos considering they held a 2-0 lead until the sixth frame when San Diego scored two runs to tie the score at two. The game then went into extra innings where San Diego scored two runs in the eighth to win the game 4-2.</p>\n<p>Clark and freshman infielder Sierra Altmeyer were the only two Gauchos to put numbers on the board. Senior infielder Arianna Palomares’ sacrifice fly resulted in an RBI that brought home Clark, while Altmeyer contributed with a homer to center field.</p>\n<p>Although the final loss was a tough one, the weekend was a solid one for UCSB to build of off. It showed some great signs of a team that is ready to do well in conference play which begins Saturday.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will stay at home to play a non-conference game on Tuesday, March 29 against Loyola Marymount at 2:00 pm at Campus Diamond.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69131\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-picks-up-solid-wins-in-final-reg-season-tourney/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69131\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-picks-up-solid-wins-in-final-reg-season-tourney/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-picks-up-solid-wins-in-final-reg-season-tourney/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-picks-up-solid-wins-in-final-reg-season-tourney/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-28/ucsb-picks-up-solid-wins-in-final-reg-season-tourney/","id":1141,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1140,1139,1138],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird","biography":"Not available","articles":[48,49,50,51,59,60,62,63,1118,1120,1123,1137,1138,1139,1140,1141,1142,1143,1144,1145,1148,1150,1176,1177,1178,1179,1183,1403,1406,1407,1410,1419,1421,1425,1426,1434,1436,1437,1444,1445,1447,1448,1449,1450,1451,1452,1455,1490,1494,1927,1928],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Looks to Keep Improving at San Diego Classic II","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Softball_vsUCR-20150503-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Softball_vsUCR-20150503-DustinHarris-10-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos look to improve upon their solid start to the season when it heads to San Diego for its final road tournament of the season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB softball team travels to San Diego this weekend for five big games in the San Diego Classic II.

The Gauchos managed to put the tying run on second with 2 outs in the inning, but Reinke struck out Jennifer Johnston to end the game. The loss extended the Gaucho losing streak to three games.</p>\n<p>In the Gauchos’ Friday night game against San Jose State, their losing streak was extended to four games as the Spartans crushed Santa Barbara 12-3.</p>\n<p>The nine run margin is the largest deficit UCSB has endured since playing Texas A&amp;M earlier in the season. San Jose starter Chantrelle Ladner pitched a complete game, giving up three runs on seven hits in seven innings, while striking out six to pick up her fourth win of the year.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, second baseman Arianna Palomares and DP Jacqueline Hinojosa each collected two hits apiece in the game. The Gauchos scored all three of their runs in the second inning. The three runs were tallied by Palomares, senior Samantha Stark, and freshman Melanie Menor.</p>\n<p>San Jose’s powerful lineup took its toll on the Gauchos’ pitching staff, as it recorded 12 hits on the day, with home runs by outstanding sophomore outfielder Brittany Abacherli and infielder Arissa Pinedo.  Abacherli went 2-4 with three RBI’s, while Pinedo knocked in four RBI’s with two runs scored.  Gaucho starter Ashley Ludlow lasted only one inning, giving up four earned runs while striking out two.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ weekend only got worse when it took on the BYU Cougars on Saturday morning, losing 8-0 in just five innings. BYU starting pitcher McKenna Bull deserved all the attention in this one as she threw a masterful five inning no-hitter.  This was Bull’s second no-hitter of the year as she gave up just one walk.</p>\n<p>She struck out seven Gauchos in the game, striking out the side in the fifth to close it out. Cougar DP Madison Merrell went 2-3 in the game with a home run and four RBI’s.</p>\n<p>The UCSB pitching staff seemed to run out of steam when it allowed five runs in the fifth inning, all off Gulvin who had replaced Ludlow in relief.  Ludlow had a tough day giving up five earned runs in four innings.</p>\n<p>The only Gaucho baserunner in the game came on a walk to Altmeyer leading off the second inning.  However, she was left stranded at first base as the Gauchos simply couldn’t find contact at the plate against Bull’s pitching.</p>\n<p>Riding a five game losing streak, UCSB managed to turn things around in its Saturday afternoon game against Colorado State. After facing them the day before, the Gauchos knew what it would take to get a win, and that’s to score early as they won the game 11-7 in a slugfest.  Santa Barbara scored six runs in the third to break open its lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were paced by center fielder Stacy Cavazos who hit a home run and finished with four RBI’s. Second basemen Arianna Palomares also hit a home run and drove in two runs. Right fielder Jessica Johnston went 4-5 at the plate with two runs scored.</p>\n<p>In addition, Altmeyer and third basemen Emily Brucelas each had 2 RBI’s a piece.</p>\n<p>Gaucho sophomore starting pitcher Lena Mayer picked up her fifth win on the year, scattering seven hits and four runs while striking out two.</p>\n<p>Rams’ starter Bridgette Hutton took her fifth loss of the season after giving up six runs on five hits in just two innings while striking out one batter.</p>\n<p>In Sunday’s game, the Gauchos took on San Diego State again and lost in heartbreaking fashion 6-5 on a walk-off solo homer by Aztec third baseman Molly Sturdivant leading off the bottom of the seventh. It was Sturdivant’s only hit in the game.</p>\n<p>The game started out well for the Gauchos as they scored three runs in the first inning capped by a two-run homer from second baseman Emily Brucelas.</p>\n<p>Kristen Clark led off the inning with a single, and she was sacrificed to second by Palomares. While facing two outs, Altmeyer doubled home Palomares, followed by the Brucelas home run to make it a 3-0 Gauchos’ lead. Santa Barbara added an unearned run in the second to make it 4-0 and registered its fifth run in the sixth inning.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs battled back however, with two runs in the second and a run in the fifth before tying it at five all with two more runs in the sixth on three hits when San Diego brought 9 batters to the plate.</p>\n<p>In the top of the seventh, the Gauchos rallied, putting two runners on base.  They got as far as third base with two outs before UCSB’s opportunity to possibly score ended on a flyout to centerfield off the bat of Stacy Cavazos.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were led by Brucelas and shortstop Melanie Menor in the losing effort.</p>\n<p>Brucelas went 2-4 in the game with the home run and two RBI’s, while Menor went 3-3 at the plate with a run scored.  Also contributing for UCSB was Clark who had two hits, two runs scored and an RBI.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had 13 hits in the game. Starting pitcher Ashley Ludlow pitched well for the Gauchos giving up just three earned runs in 5.2 innings while scattering eight hits and striking out two.  Veronika Gulvin came on in relief in the 7<sup>th</sup> and took the loss.</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to rebound next weekend when it returns home to host the Gaucho Classic II, and will take on Bakersfield, Seattle, Santa Clara and San Diego once again.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69056\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/slow-start-ends-with-ucsbs-lone-victory-at-san-diego-classic-ii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69056\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/slow-start-ends-with-ucsbs-lone-victory-at-san-diego-classic-ii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/slow-start-ends-with-ucsbs-lone-victory-at-san-diego-classic-ii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/slow-start-ends-with-ucsbs-lone-victory-at-san-diego-classic-ii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-21/slow-start-ends-with-ucsbs-lone-victory-at-san-diego-classic-ii/","id":1139,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1138,1137,1136],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hoping to Get Back on Track, Host Gauchos Classic II","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-03-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-DustinHarris-4-1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Softball_vsGeorgiaTech-20160227-DustinHarris-4-1-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a frustrating 1-4 finish in last weekend's SDSU/San Diego Classic II, the UCSB softball team is hoping to regain its momentum in its return home as the host of the Gaucho Classic II.

The Roadrunners  currently own an overall record of 6-15, a record which can largely be attributed to their weak hitting. As a team, Bakersfield is hitting only .237, but has one player, sophomore outfielder Julea Cavazos, who is hitting .364.</p>\n<p>Also contributing is junior infielder Selena Gonzalez, who is hitting an outstanding .429 at the plate. The Roadrunners have only scored a total of 59 runs, while giving up a total of 103.</p>\n<p>Bakersfield’s pitching has struggled this year as well, however senior starter Amber Mills carries a 2.92 ERA. She has given up a total of 20 earned runs in 48 innings this season, but has managed to tally only  23 strikeouts .</p>\n<p>The weekend shouldn’t get much harder for the Gauchos when they take on the Seattle Redhawks in <span data-term=\"goog_23356199\">Friday’s</span> late game. Seattle enters the tournament with a 10-16 record and a team batting average of .261. It’s best hitter, junior second baseman Paige Bouska, leads her team with a batting average of .366, and will pose a threat to the Gaucho pitching staff.</p>\n<p>Redhawks starting pitcher freshman Andie Larkins should have a difficult time with the hard hitting Gaucho lineup. Larkins is 8-6 on the year with 52 strikeouts in 86.2 innings.She has a respectable ERA of 2.91, giving up 36 earned runs this season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will continue its weekend with a bout versus Santa Clara <span data-term=\"goog_23356200\">on Friday</span>. The Broncos have one of the worst records of the four opponents the Gauchos will face this weekend. Santa Clara, with an overall record of 5-24, holds the lowest batting average of the four with an average of .233.</p>\n<p>The Broncos are another team who is weak in both hitting and pitching this year. The pitching staff allowed opponents to hit for a lofty .352 average on the season.</p>\n<p>Santa Clara’s best pitcher, sophomore starter Micaela Vierra, carries a shaky 4.83 ERA in addition to giving up 58  earned runs in 84 innings pitched this season.  She comes into the game with a 3-10 record and 41 strikeouts.  Senior infielder Casandra Padilla leads the team in hitting with a .298 average.  She also leads the team with two home runs, 12 runs scored, and 15 RBI’s.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will finish the weekend with perhaps its most competitive game against the University of San Diego. San Diego has an overall record of 10-20, and brings a team batting average of .288. However, San Diego’s best pitcher Megan Sabbatini, with a 3.70 ERA, has the most strikeouts of any pitcher the Gauchos will face, striking out 92 hitters in 87 innings pitched. The hard throwing Sabbatini will surely put the pressure on a strong UCSB lineup.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, the Gauchos enter this weekend’s  tournament as the team to beat. After its tough  losses in San Diego, it will be looking to boost its confidence with wins over the weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69094\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-23/ucsb-hoping-to-get-back-on-track-host-gauchos-classic-ii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69094\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-23/ucsb-hoping-to-get-back-on-track-host-gauchos-classic-ii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-23/ucsb-hoping-to-get-back-on-track-host-gauchos-classic-ii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-23/ucsb-hoping-to-get-back-on-track-host-gauchos-classic-ii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-23/ucsb-hoping-to-get-back-on-track-host-gauchos-classic-ii/","id":1140,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1139,1138,1137],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
