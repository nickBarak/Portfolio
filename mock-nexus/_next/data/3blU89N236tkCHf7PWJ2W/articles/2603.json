through UC Santa Barbara’s campus on Thursday, joining more than 100 campuses nationwide in the Million Student March, a movement demanding free tuition, the elimination of student debt and a $15 minimum wage.</p>\n<p>The march was the largest protest on UCSB’s campus in recent memory and stoked the embers of other activist movements: many students wore black to show solidarity with University of Missouri protesters, sported Bernie Sanders pins or held up Black Lives Matter signs. Approximately a dozen organizers labored to direct the larger-than-expected crowd as they marched from Storke Tower to Cheadle Hall and back while documenting the march on social media. At one point, students began banging on the windows of Cheadle Hall, an administrative building, before organizers directed them back on the planned route.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz as being these places with strong activist spirits, but I think we proved today … that [UCSB is] every bit a part of that legacy of student activism.<br>\n<em>–A.S. vice president for statewide affairs Mohsin Mirza</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Associated Students (A.S.) student advocate general and fourth-year global studies and art double-major Joseline Garcia, who helped organize the event, said she was surprised by the turnout, but not the students’ passion.</p>\n<p>“Whether it was big or small, I expected [students] to be passionate, and I think it exceeded my own expectation,” Garcia said. “I think we made a moment today on this campus.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said the organizers wanted to send a message that people should have the right to graduate college without student debt.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/960x641.png.3937b392a0c541fa93ab7cb4b2dc6a99.large_.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"601445665\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66452\"><img data-attachment-id=\"66436\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/sidebar-gallery/960x641-png-3937b392a0c541fa93ab7cb4b2dc6a99-large/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/960x641.png.3937b392a0c541fa93ab7cb4b2dc6a99.large_.jpeg?fit=960%2C641&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,641\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"960×641.png.3937b392a0c541fa93ab7cb4b2dc6a99.large\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/960x641.png.3937b392a0c541fa93ab7cb4b2dc6a99.large_.jpeg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/960x641.png.3937b392a0c541fa93ab7cb4b2dc6a99.large_.jpeg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignright wp-image-66436\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/960x641.png.3937b392a0c541fa93ab7cb4b2dc6a99.large_-250x167.jpeg?resize=350%2C234\" alt=\"960x641.png.3937b392a0c541fa93ab7cb4b2dc6a99.large\" width=\"350\" height=\"234\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/960x641.png.3937b392a0c541fa93ab7cb4b2dc6a99.large_.jpeg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/960x641.png.3937b392a0c541fa93ab7cb4b2dc6a99.large_.jpeg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>“Our goal was to start a conversation regarding all these issues: free higher education, $15 minimum wage and no student loan debt,” Garcia said. “We have the right to be able to live and prosper and be happy, and we have a right to graduate without student loans and invest in our own future.”</p>\n<p>In a statement released Thursday afternoon, UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang said he supports students and sees the need for a “vital dialogue” on how to make public higher education accessible.</p>\n<p>“We will continue to send a strong message to our elected officials about the value of the University of California and the need to keep higher education accessible and affordable to all Californians,” Yang said in the statement.</p>\n<p>A.S. vice president for statewide affairs and fourth-year black studies and sociology double-major Mohsin Mirza said organizers were nervous about how many people would attend the protest until hundreds of students arrived on the steps of Storke Tower at noon.</p>\n<p>“We were all nervous about how many students we could get to turn out to make this statement,” Mirza said. “It was all about making the loudest statement possible that we, as a generation, agree with these three demands.”</p>\n<p>Once a few hundred students gathered, organizers led the march across campus as administrators and students looked on. Protesters implored students to “walk out” of classes, and by the time the crowd reached Campbell Hall, more than a thousand students had joined the march.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66445\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"453475648\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66452\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66445\" data-attachment-id=\"66445\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/more-than-1000-march-for-free-tuition-living-wage/million-student-march-8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447334061\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"75\",\"iso\":\"50\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Million Student March-8\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66445\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8-250x167.jpg?resize=350%2C234\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"234\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-8.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66445\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Mirza, who helped organize the event, said the march showcases UCSB’s activist culture.</p>\n<p>“We talk about UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz as being these places with strong activist spirits, but I think we proved today … that [UCSB is] every bit a part of that legacy of student activism,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Education Ph.D. candidate Kathy Swift said the march was reminiscent of previous movements on other UC campuses.</p>\n<p>“There’s been some really big student protests at other campuses, and it seems to me like UCSB has been pretty small to negligible,” Swift said. “This is the first time I saw such a massive outpouring of protest from UCSB students concerning tuition and education.”</p>\n<p>Swift said she felt she was the “most senior” person in the march, and wished that more faculty members had attended.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s incumbent upon the professors and the adjuncts and the educators here to come show support with students,” Swift said. “If I’m going to really put my money where my mouth is and be a true educator and teacher, I have to support students.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m carrying massive amounts of debt right now and, in fact, I get no support from my department.

One protester voiced her disappointment that activists did not occupy one of the buildings on campus.</p>\n<p>A.S. assistant director of community affairs and fourth-year political science and history double-major Jared Daniels helped organize the march and said he could not rule out “occupy movements” in the future, but said Thursday’s march was about sending a message to administrators.</p>\n<p>“It’s like a poker game — you don’t want to throw all your cards and chips out on the table when you get a good hand,” Daniels said. “We have a really good hand right now. I think that there will be a time to occupy if [administrators] don’t take us seriously this time.”</p>\n<p>Co-chair of UCSB’s Black Student Union and fourth-year black studies and sociology double-major Jamelia Harris said it is the state of California’s responsibility to make sure all students can attend college.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66449\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-12.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"400980594\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66452\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66449\" data-attachment-id=\"66449\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/more-than-1000-march-for-free-tuition-living-wage/million-student-march-12/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-12.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447336304\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Million Student March-12\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-12.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-12.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66449\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-12-1024x684.jpg?resize=350%2C234\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"234\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-12.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-12.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Million-Student-March-12.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66449\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“The failure of our state’s public higher education system to enhance accessibility and diversity initiatives — especially for black students — must be remedied by an increase in state funds and a decrease in classist, exorbitant tuition expenses,” Harris said. “The burden of improving our public higher education system should be on the state of California as opposed to us students and our families.”</p>\n<p>Graduate Student Association president Aaron Jones said students once could pursue public higher education without being burdened by debt.</p>\n<p>“The state, for whatever reason, has reneged on their commitment to higher education, while at the same time investing heavily in the prison industrial complex, and that’s a very stark example of the prioritization of the state,” Jones said. “What I observed here is the continuation of a movement to really put the public back as priority.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>To see not only so many people on our own campus but across campuses, so many people on Facebook liking, sharing, changing their profile pictures, news articles being posted about this, it’s absolutely amazing.

This is living history.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said State Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson recently asked her if she will attend law school, and Garcia replied she was unsure if she can afford it.</p>\n<p>“I have two younger brothers who also have dreams that I have to think about,” Garcia said. “My father’s a gardener and my mother’s a housekeeper — they don’t make a lot of money. I’m in a position where I have to think about other people’s futures as well and determine how much I can invest in mine.”</p>\n<p>The march demonstrated a re-emergence of student mobilization that has historically driven fundamental change in society, according to Jones.</p>\n<p>“Perhaps the stark realities of being priced out of higher education or being saddled with five or six-figure debt is enough to motivate more people to say ‘this is not right’ and to do something about it,” Jones said.</p>\n<p><em>Assistant News Editor Juliet Bachtel and Reporter Olivia Pla contributed

Sweater Party in the Loma Pelona Center on Monday, encouraging the spirit of the holidays with an ugly sweater contest, cookie decorating, snacks, festive music and a photo booth.</p>\n<p>The Ugly Sweater Party took place after the first day of instruction following Thanksgiving break, and on the official commencement day of “Dead Week.” R.A. of the Zaca house and second-year biochemistry major Mitine and R.A. of the Camuesa house and third-year sociology and psychology double-major Aranki invited students to don holiday attire and relax before finals.</p>\n<p>Mitine said she enjoyed watching friends gather together in Loma Pelona and decorate cookies from an ugly sweater cookie kit.</p>\n<p>“It makes you feel like you’re in kindergarten,” Mitine said. “You’re decorating cookies and people are talking and getting to know each other.”</p>\n<p>Mitine said she is excited for Christmas break because she wants to spend time with friends and family and enjoy her first Christmas in Hawaii. Mitine said organizing the event was fun because she loves Christmas and the winter season.</p>\n<p>“Decorating was fun,” Mitine said. “The holiday times are my favorite, so doing a program like this was not a problem.”</p>\n<p>Third-year biology major Yaneli Gutierrez said her favorite part of the party was decorating cookies, which she modeled after her reindeer sweater. Gutierrez also said she attended the party because she enjoys Christmas and ugly sweaters.</p>\n<p>“The tackier the better,” Gutierrez said.</p>\n<p>Aranki said she wanted to host a fun holiday party as a “de-stresser” for her residents.</p>\n<p>“I really care about residents a lot, especially their mental well-being,” Aranki said.</p>\n<p>Mitine said she hoped the event would be a fun way to bring the residents together.</p>\n<p>“Everyone always talks about how they miss being home for the holidays,” Mitine said. “Dead Week and finals are so stressful.”</p>\n<p>Mitine said the Loma Pelona Center was chosen for the event because it is between Manzanita and San Rafael residence halls and facilitates opportunities to meet other students.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s just a nice way to get people out of their room or away from the library for a little bit and to all be out here together,” Mitine said.</p>\n<p>Third year biology major Heidi Lee said Christmas is one of her favorite holidays because she gets to spend time with friends and family.</p>\n<p>“I want to skip over finals and get to break,” Lee said.</p>\n<p>International student from Belgium Annelies Leenknecht said she is currently taking classes at Santa Barbara City College on a gap year.</p>\n<p>Leenknecht said she enjoyed attending the party in preparation for winter break, although she wishes she was returning to Santa Barbara in January.</p>\n<p>“I wish I could come back here afterwards,” Leenknecht said. “I have to stay home unfortunately.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66885\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/resident-assistants-host-ugly-sweater-party-to-celebrate-upcoming-holidays/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66885\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/resident-assistants-host-ugly-sweater-party-to-celebrate-upcoming-holidays/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/resident-assistants-host-ugly-sweater-party-to-celebrate-upcoming-holidays/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/resident-assistants-host-ugly-sweater-party-to-celebrate-upcoming-holidays/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/resident-assistants-host-ugly-sweater-party-to-celebrate-upcoming-holidays/","id":2600,"author":{"id":138,"name":"Selina Alvarez"},"related":[2599,2598,2597],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Share Childhood Stories about Santa","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SANTA-.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SANTA-.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"For many of us, the holiday season comes with disappointments in the form of finals, failed classes and freezing temperatures as low as 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

But each year the holiday season brings a much more severe disappointment to children around the world: the realization that Santa Claus isn’t real.</p>\n<p>We all have our own story of discovery, and the <em>Nexus </em>asked five UC Santa Barbara students to share the moment they discovered the magical man was, in fact, a legend.</p>\n<p>First-year biology major Sam Lewis said he was sick and home from school one day when his mom sat him down, holding an article about Saint Nicholas to show he was real at some point.</p>\n<p>“Then she said, ‘Even though [Santa Claus] is gone, his spirit still lives on through Christmas, and now you’re part of the knowing club because Santa Claus doesn’t really exist — we’re Santa Claus,’” Lewis said. “‘Your brother isn’t part of the club, so don’t tell him. When he’s about your age, we’ll tell him as well.’ And so for the next couple of years, I was in the know and I thought I was in this cool, exclusive club.”</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Varshini Satish said she was eager to catch Santa Claus one year with her dad. The two of them camped out by the fireplace on Christmas Eve with baseball bats and a garbage bag to catch Santa.</p>\n<p>“I tried to stay awake as long as I could, but I eventually fell asleep,” Satish said. “At some point I woke up when I heard a movement. My dad told me he had gone to get a glass of water, but I saw presents under the tree and I looked at the handwriting on them and it all clicked in my brain.”</p>\n<p>First-year undeclared major Camila Holm’s parents were not ready to tell her the truth about Santa Claus when her aunt spoiled the secret one year.</p>\n<p>“My mom always had special wrapping paper and special tags for Santa to use and then when my aunt came to visit, she mixed them up,” Holm said. “So then Santa and my aunt had the same wrapping paper and when I asked my mom about it, I found out.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Travis Kim discovered the sad reality when he supposedly misread the calendar one year.</p>\n<p>“Santa came on [December] 24th . . . I asked my mom why and she said, ‘Everyone makes mistakes — even Santa,’” Kim said. “But Santa never makes mistakes . . . that’s when I knew.”</p>\n<p>For some, like first-year biology major Sunaina Kongara, the illusion of Santa Claus and his reindeer never existed.</p>\n<p>“I never believed in Santa because my dad was too lazy,” Kongara said. “He wouldn’t even wait until we fell asleep to put presents under the tree or eat all the cookies.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 in the Thursday, Dec. 3 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66918\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/students-discuss-discovering-santas-secret/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66918\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/students-discuss-discovering-santas-secret/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/students-discuss-discovering-santas-secret/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/students-discuss-discovering-santas-secret/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/students-discuss-discovering-santas-secret/","id":2602,"author":{"id":140,"name":"Olivia Pla"},"related":[2601,2600,2599],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Professor Rios Lectures On Justice, Race","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rios_by-Alex-Nagase-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rios_by-Alex-Nagase-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Professor of sociology Victor Rios spoke with students in the Loma Paloma Center on Tuesday about the United States justice system, race relations and mentorship opportunities.

There are many people that can do it for you.”</p>\n<p>Rios said when he was younger, he stood on corners with his arms wide open in despair, hoping to be shot in a drive-by.</p>\n<p>“It was a chance encounter when my best friend was killed that led me to want to change,” Rios said. “I didn’t want to go to prison. I didn’t want to end up dead. People we might consider lost souls are like oysters, they are only going to open up when they are ready to change.”</p>\n<p>Rios said he felt disbelief upon being admitted to California State University East Bay, on academic probationary status and with a 1.9 grade point average, describing the occurrence as a “second chance.”</p>\n<p>“It’s important to speak truth and power, but it’s also important to speak truth to people,” Rios said. “Those college students spoke truth to me, and that is why I am here today … The social justice work that you do is a matter of life or death and I am just one example of this.”</p>\n<p>Rios encouraged the audience to consider applying to graduate school, which he said had opened doors for him.</p>\n<p>“Find your purpose and do something with your education that can open up doors for advocating for what you believe in,” Rios said.</p>\n<p>Third-year black studies and sociology double major Janet Lopez said she took Rios’ course on juvenile justice this past summer.</p>\n<p>“Rios is really down to earth and relatable since he is from the inner cities of Oakland,” Lopez said. “He has been through a lot in his life and he is a really genuine teacher. His life story and the way he interacts with his students is one of the main reasons why I really wanted to come to this talk tonight.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Stephanie Periban said Rios inspired her to act on issues affecting Latino students.</p>\n<p>“Rios is also a true inspiration for the Latino community. Anyone that could overcome the adversities Rios has faced and become the success story and inspiration he is today deserves a standing ovation,” Periban said.<br>\nThird-year sociology major Yessica Becerra said she enjoyed the event and hopes to take a course with Rios before graduating.</p>\n<p>“When I saw this event on Facebook, I got really excited and cleared my schedule,” Becerra said. “I’m really glad I’m here and get to experience him as a lecturer, and hope that in my last five quarters I have the opportunity to take a course with him.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Nov. 12, issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66425\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/professor-rios-lectures-on-justice-race/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66425\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/professor-rios-lectures-on-justice-race/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/professor-rios-lectures-on-justice-race/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/professor-rios-lectures-on-justice-race/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/professor-rios-lectures-on-justice-race/","id":2601,"author":{"id":142,"name":"Erin Kownacki"},"related":[2600,2599,2598],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
