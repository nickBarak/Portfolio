After losing nearly half his life to the prison system, his outlook felt bleak — except for his hopes of going to college. He already had nearly a year’s worth of credits thanks to a newfound passion for learning he discovered while in prison. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising — now two months into his time at UC Santa Barbara as a third-year comparative literature and interdisciplinary major — heard about a program called Berkeley Underground Scholars (BUS) shortly before his release, which helps formerly incarcerated individuals attain college degrees. Eager to learn more, he called Danny Murillo, co-founder of BUS, off of a contraband cell phone, who assured him there was hope after prison through education. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89857\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89857\" data-attachment-id=\"89857\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-20/formerly-incarcerated-student-wants-to-make-a-blueprint-for-others-to-pursue-higher-education/dsc_3294/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC_3294.jpg?fit=2048%2C1363&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1363\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DSC_3294\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC_3294.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC_3294.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-89857\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC_3294.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC_3294.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC_3294.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC_3294.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC_3294.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC_3294.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-89857\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Rising, it’s the prospect of leaving a legacy for his children that motivates him to continue helping formerly incarcerated students. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon release from prison, Rising became houseless, but BUS had not forgotten about him. Members of BUS flew to meet Rising in San Diego, where he was living after prison, to convince him to enroll in San Diego Community College and start his own chapter of Underground Scholars there, but multiple hurdles sent Rising on a detour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising curbed his drug use after taking a class in prison on the pharmacology of drug abuse, but he was still admitted to rehab after leaving prison. He soon left, walking away from an offer to work at the facility so that he could go to school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But upon arrival, Rising instantly felt out of place. While in class, the insecurities of his “tatted up” appearance and his age — a decade older than most — spiraled him into dejection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanted to quit. I didn’t feel like I belonged. So I called Martin [Vela-Sanchez] up at Berkeley Underground Scholars and he goes ‘Flaco, just do 90 days [at the college]. Do 90 days and shake as many hands as you can and you’re going to see that people were there that went through the same exact thing you did,’” Rising said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Three years later, I’m getting my associate’s degree, the first person in my whole entire family to get an associate’s degree, to get any college degree at that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While in community college, Rising learned to embrace his differences and founded the Urban Scholars Union, a support group for formerly incarcerated students. But two years wasn’t much time, Rising said, and following graduation, he was looking to establish something bigger: “I beat prison and I used school as a platform to end the cycle of recidivism, I found a way out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an associate’s degree under his belt, Rising began scouting universities to continue his education. He had applied to four UC schools — UC Irvine, UC Los Angeles, UC Santa Barbara and UC Berkeley — along with the University of San Diego and was accepted to all of them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After visiting UCSB, Rising was sold — in part, he said, because there was no Underground Scholars program here. He felt a calling to carve out a program from scratch, despite everyone at UC Berkeley that was “waiting for [him].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Berkeley has Berkeley Underground Scholars, UC Irvine has UC Irvine Underground Scholars, UCLA has UCLA Underground Scholars, UC Santa Barbara has nothing and neither did USD,” Rising said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He hopes to make his own mark on the campus with the creation of such a program, one that would be the first of its kind at UCSB. Operating like most others within the UC system, UCSB Underground Scholars will support students released from prison in an effort to guide them through their educational experience and walk away with a degree. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have been trained by my mentors — the other students who have come before me — who paved the way so there’s a blueprint that can be implemented to actually help other formerly incarcerated individuals,” Rising said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So I came [to UCSB] with this blueprint in hand, like ‘Hey look, there’s a bunch of formerly incarcerated students that are going to get out with their associate’s degrees and they’re going to have their 60 units credits and they’re going to be wanting to come here.’ What are we going to do to prepare to receive them?”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising said he is currently working with the Office of Admissions, the Educational Opportunity Program, the Transfer Student Initiative, Assistant Vice Chancellor Katya Armistead and other Underground Scholar programs, in addition to seeking out a space on campus to house the initiative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although still in its early stages, Rising already sees the potential of having a space for formerly incarcerated students on campus. By extending a hand to someone who could use help in school, like Rising himself, he said the initiative is a way to break the tumultuous cycle of the prison system, where many individuals often end up back behind bars because they never had the opportunity to pursue higher education.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“From correctional facilities to college, we’re focused on helping people come back out and re-enter through the college system because we’re set up from the gate, we’re set up to fail by probation and parole,” Rising said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We got all these stipulations that are thrown on us. They put us in these re-entry homes that are in the ghettos with drug dealers and drugs around them. And they know that we’re gonna fail and they know that we’re gonna recidivate right back in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising embraces his past, not only to use it as fuel for his ambitions, but also to show people like him that a life outside of prison is completely possible. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m promoting college and I dub it as being a ‘gangsta nerd.’ I’m still that gang member. I still represent East LA, but I represent it in a new way,” he said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Rising, two million incarcerated individuals in America is too high of a number for the country “that celebrates freedom the most.” His solution extends beyond UCSB, where he hopes to see more unity in communities that are hurt the most by crime and incarceration. Oftentimes, he said, it’s the absence of a legacy to aspire to that sends people to prison. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Rising, it’s the prospect of leaving a legacy for his children that motivates him to continue helping formerly incarcerated students as an advocate for education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My children have been through a lot, their dad hasn’t always been there, I’ve been incarcerated,” Rising said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But now, my daughter wants to go to college,” Rising said. “My son, he wants to be an author.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m building a legacy for them to follow.” </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

<em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David Alcocer, associate vice president of the Budget Analysis and Planning office, led the discussion around the possibility of cohort-based tuition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Cohort-based tuition] could benefit students and institutions alike,” he said during the meeting, pointing out that the practice has “been adopted by a number of public universities in other states” but that it has never been done on “as large a scale as we are discussing today.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To better implement the plan, Alcocer said the UC Office of The President (UCOP) reached out to universities that have implemented cohort-based tuition to learn what works and what doesn’t, stating that universities must have stable revenue streams from state funds, tuition and investments in order to reach their principle goals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also pointed out that the tuition changes could be “pegged to the rate of inflation” so that the tuition would remain flat at “constant dollars,” meaning the purchasing power of the cost remains the same throughout each year, but the cash amount goes up with inflation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nathan Brostrom, executive vice president of the UC Office of the Chief Financial Officer, said there are numerous decisions involved with the change, such as deciding whether the approach would be for both undergraduate and graduate students, whether the plan should include just base tuition or other fees as well and how long a cohort should be defined as, noting that many low-income students take longer to complete their degree. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When phasing in cohort-based tuition, the tuition increases would ideally be tied to inflation but would affect only a quarter of the students at the beginning, “so you might have to do a slightly higher increase in the beginning to make up for that lost revenue,” Brostrom said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recalling numerous protests over tuition hikes, Regent Sherry Lansing said that it was not necessarily the tuition hike that caused an outcry but rather inconsistency in the tuition hikes, referencing the</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_California_college_tuition_hike_protests\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 2009 Occupy protests. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lansing stated that she has never seen the Regents want to increase tuition, but by not raising tuition, universities often have to cut programs and limit their growth in response to shortfalls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It seems to me that this is a perfect time to discuss this,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vice Chair Cecilia Estolano explained that for the plan to be successful, the UC would need the California state legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom to both be fully on board with the plan in addition to maintaining the UC’s goals. UC’s </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/uc-2030-dashboard\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">goals for 2030</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are to award upwards of 1 million degrees, close the achievement gap and add 1,100 professor positions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that having a steady revenue for the UC would be necessary to maintain the cohort-tuition approach. Estolano continued by noting that unexpected pitfalls in funding are a guarantee going forward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We know there will be a recession. We know there will be pressure, so we need to have some other mechanism to still achieve these goals,” Estolano said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Regent Lark Park, the issue came down to, “How do we fund the university we want?” He said that if the Regents approach this model, they need to look deeply into where the UC’s money comes from before going forward with any plans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s been very clear from the conversation that we cannot look at this as a singular question but how it relates to other issues, raised with respect to what kind of university we want to build,” Regent Chair John Perez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In closing the discussion, Napolitano said that a working group has been formed to research the topic, consisting of Chair Perez, Regent Maria Anguiano, Student Regent Hayley Weddle and UC Vice Chair of the Academic Senate Kum-Kum Bhavnani. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We obviously have a lot of work to do,” Napolitano said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Moving away is always a difficult thing to do. No matter the age, moving away from the people you made bonds with and the places you grew attached to is something that most would like to avoid.</p>\n<p>Sometimes though, moving away to a new place is the only option to keep on doing what they love. This is true about UCSB’s own Mitchell Hamilton, a junior sociology major who had to leave his dream school to come to Santa Barbara and continue doing what he loves most: playing water polo. It is a decision he certainly has come to love and embrace.</p>\n<p>Hamilton grew up loving water polo. He was a star polo player in high school, leading his team to four league championships. He was also honored with achievements such as First Team All-America and First Team All CCS. However, he says he owes all his success to his mother, the person who encouraged him to play such a demanding sport.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I started playing water polo when I was in seventh grade,” Hamilton said. “My mom was the one who pushed me into water polo and I really owe a lot to her.”</p>\n<p>Being the great high school player that he was, Hamilton had many options to continue his playing career. Ultimately he settled on Cal, a school he admired growing up, not only for its academics, but also its consistently good water polo program.</p>\n<p>Hamilton seemed to have made the right choice at the time. As a freshman, he scored 16 goals for the Golden Bears and was a key player on the team. Cal eventually made it to the MPSF Championship against USC before losing the match 9-5. Still, as a freshman Hamilton played a big role, scoring two goals in that game, a good sign for the future.</p>\n<p>As a sophomore, Hamilton again registered 16 goals along with 15 assists. Once again he was a big factor on the team even though it didn’t make a run as deep as the year before.</p>\n<p>“I loved Cal. The players were great.” Hamilton said. “I liked the competiveness that went on in practice. I felt like everybody was really fighting for a spot to travel every practice.”</p>\n<p>Although Hamilton showed great promise and had a great two years at Cal, something always bothered him. He kept on having troubles with the coaching staff. The issues got so bad that he decided to leave the water polo program after his sophomore season.</p>\n<p>“After a while I didn’t see eye-to-eye with the coach, which is why I left the program.” Hamilton said. “I didn’t want to play for him anymore. It was a tough personal choice.”</p>\n<p>Hamilton now was faced with the toughest choice of his young adult life; to return to Cal without ever playing water polo again or leave the school he loved. He decided to take a semester away from school to really think about what he wanted, working as a math tutor and caterer in the meantime.</p>\n<p>“It was actually really fun,” Hamilton said happily. “It was nice to make some money and just take time off. My family was also very supportive, something I am thankful for.”</p>\n<p>While Hamilton was deciding his next step during the 2014-2015 campaign, the UCSB water polo program was suffering its worst season ever. The Gauchos finished 11-15, winless in conference play, and finished seventh place in the MPSF championships.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Wolf Wigo knew his roster was more than talented to make a better run next year but he also knew getting a player like Hamilton wouldn’t hurt. The two were almost meant for each other. Hamilton needed a new start and Wigo needed another attacker to replace Eric Van de Mortel, who graduated after last season as one of UCSB’s top offensive players.</p>\n<p>“When Wolf reached out and contacted me, he really highlighted the great opportunities I would have at UCSB,” Hamilton said. “And the guys on the team are all a bunch of winners, which are the type of people I like hanging out with.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Hamilton was swayed and decided to come play his remaining two years of eligibility at Santa Barbara, a decision that has been beneficial for everyone involved.</p>\n<p>Since coming here, Hamilton has set new career highs in both goals scored and steals with 21 and 18 respectively. He has also become a team leader and is a guy that the whole locker room respects.</p>\n<p>“My new career highs are cool but I’m not worried about that,” Hamilton said. “I’m just really happy to be on such a great water polo team and contributing to wins.”</p>\n<p>Hamilton’s modesty is admirable; however, his head coach knows that he is a big factor on this team and is happy that he decided to join.</p>\n<p>“He’s the fastest guy on this team,” Wigo said. “He helps with the counter-attack and he’s a great player enjoying a great season. He’s also a guy that works everyday as hard as he can and sets a good example for the younger guys. I’m really proud of him.”</p>\n<p>Hamilton is not just a hit with the coaching staff, but also with the players. He is a great locker room guy that the players love being around. This is no more apparent than with seniors Derek Shoemaker and Chris Whitelegge.</p>\n<p>“He plays a huge role on this team and his shot is deadly,” Shoemaker said. “He’s my roommate and I love hanging with him. He’s a great influence and he’s been a great teammate.”</p>\n<p>“He’s just such a skilled player.” Whitelegge added. “I remember playing against him when he was at Cal and he was good then, I’m glad he plays for us now. He’s great to be around and his positive energy constantly rubs off on the team.”</p>\n<p>With the seniors departing soon as the season is coming to an end, Hamilton will be the new face of UCSB water polo, something that he has earned with his great play and something he hopes to keep living up to.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, leaving Cal was very hard, but it seems to have paid off for Hamilton. He has been able to be a factor on a team that has been very welcoming of him and he has come to love the atmosphere of Santa Barbara in general.</p>\n<p>“I love the ocean, and the girls are beautiful here,” Hamilton jokingly said. “I just really love it here and I love this team. I love being back on a team with a bunch of great dudes, playing a game I love. SB is beautiful and everybody seems like they are happy to be here.”</p>\n<p>Leaving is certainly a tough thing to do, but sometimes in the end, it is worth it. It has worked out for Mitch Hamilton and it has most definitely worked out for anyone associated with UCSB water polo.
