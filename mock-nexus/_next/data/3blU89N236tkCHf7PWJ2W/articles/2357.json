I am truly grateful for all of the opportunities coming my way.”</p>\n<p>The conference was free for the participants and their families thanks to AISA members raising the necessary funds.</p>\n<p>Bradford said their funding comes from “several partners across campus,” including the Chancellor’s and Vice Chancellor’s office, several academic and student affairs departments and A.S. organizations including Community Affairs Board, Student Commission on Racial Equality and Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee.</p>\n<p>Their main source of funding is the Student-Initiated Outreach Program (SIOP), Bradford said. They also receive donations from various partners on and off campus.</p>\n<p>According to the 2016-17 UCSB Campus Profile, Native American students make up 1 percent of the graduate and undergraduate student population, and Bradford said there are currently about 240 self-identified Native American graduate and undergraduate students enrolled at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“This means that these students self-identified on their applications when they were applying to UCSB,” Bradford said.</p>\n<p>She also said, however, that there is no accurate way to identify the actual percentage of Native American students on campus because some students may be multiracial or multiethnic and choose to identify with other demographics when applying.</p>\n<p>Some students, she said, do not disclose their race or ethnicity because it is not required.</p>\n<p>“Some of our AISA members chose not to identify on the application … but of all the UC schools, we enroll the greatest number of self-identified American Indians,” Bradford said.</p>\n<p>Bradford said the organization tabled at the S.T.E.M. Student Welcome day last year where members talked about Indigenous science and ways of taking action on campus in support of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline through fundraisers, honorings and activism.</p>\n<p>The group experienced record-high membership during the 2016-17 school year and attended a dinner with Student Affairs Staff to discuss Native American experiences in April.</p>\n<p>Jeike Meijer, a first-year global and feminist studies double major of Arawak heritage, said it is comforting “to know that you’re not alone” as a Native American student.</p>\n<p>Meijer said everyone in the group is “incredibly welcoming,” and she hopes to become more involved throughout the rest of her undergraduate years.</p>\n<p>Meijer said it is difficult to mobilize more students because of the lack of Native American visibility and hopes to create more opportunities for Native American students as a newly elected Assembly District Delegate for the California Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>“In America there are things that Native Americans go through and face that other people don’t necessarily recognize or think about,” Meijer said. “When you get into a group with other Native American students that realize this, it is very unifying because shared experiences and thoughts allow us to connect.”</p>\n<p>K’Ehleyr McNulty, an AISA member who will soon be graduating with degree in earth science, said AISA is the one place she can feel “worthy” of her own experiences and opinions.</p>\n<p>An Arizona native, McNulty said the organization has become an extension of her home and her Ohlone Costanoan Esselen Native American Nation during her time at UCSB. She said it has become a place where Native American students can find commonalities with one another in their heritage.</p>\n<p>She said she hopes the group will grow in the following years after she graduates in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>“It is the one place I can feel myself the most on this campus,” McNulty said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

id=\"caption-attachment-78383\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The crew of six confronted great white sharks, April fog and uncharitable ships in their 13-mile journey across the Santa Barbara Channel to Anacapa Island. The one-way trip took eight hours. <em>Courtesy of Byron Roos-Collins</em></p></div>\n<p>They had been training for months to trek the 13 miles across the channel, but nothing could prepare them for what lay ahead.</p>\n<p>The group launched at 8 a.m. from Channel Islands Beach in Oxnard and soon met several hiccups.</p>\n<p>To begin, the group had not weight-checked their kayaks prior to launching, and, as a result, some members capsized within the first few hours.</p>\n<p>They also discovered that the radios that they had brought were malfunctioning, which left the kayakers unable to call in for help in the event of an emergency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a thick marine layer of fog that April morning made for especially low visibility. Byron Roos-Collins, fourth-year political science major, said the group could hardly see further than a mile ahead of them. Much of their trek across the channel incidentally followed a zigzag course.</p>\n<p>After paddling for several hours, the group of six reached the middle of the channel, a site of high traffic for cargo ships.</p>\n<p>As the kayakers waited for a cargo ship to pass, they spotted a dorsal fin emerge from the water approximately 20 feet away. It was a distinctly triangular fin jutting nearly three feet above the ocean surface, one that the kayakers knew could only belong to a great white shark.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen thousands and thousands of dolphins and whales, and this was neither of those,” Roos-Collins said.</p>\n<p>With the large freighters still passing by around them, the group found themselves unable to paddle away from the shark; they were stuck. The six kayakers had no choice but to stay put and prepare for the worst.</p>\n<p>Anticipating that the shark might mistake the kayaks for seals, the group put their kayaks together to form a larger vessel. Each person had a spear gun or buck knife at the ready.</p>\n<p>Nik Frey, a UCSB alumnus who had recently returned from volunteering as a frontline medic in Mosul, Iraq, began giving the group instructions on how to apply a tourniquet, just in case anyone in the group lost an extremity in a bout with the shark. He also advised that, in the event of a shark attack, the kayakers stab the shark in its “sensitive face” rather than spearing it “willy-nilly.”</p>\n<p>When the freighters passed, the kayakers immediately took the opportunity to make a full charge toward the island. They only made it halfway across the shipping lanes when they spotted the dorsal fin of yet another great white shark.</p>\n<p>“That one was more disheartening I think,” Roos-Collins said.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the shark was uninterested and passed by the group.</p>\n<p>Spirits were low at this point, and the kayakers decided that they would wave down the next boat that passed them in hopes that it would rescue them.</p>\n<p>When a boat finally did pass by, the group waved their hands in the air and blew whistles to get the driver’s attention. Frey said the driver “must have seen” them, but the boat did not stop for them. The group was left “totally abandoned,” Frey said.</p>\n<p>“They gave us no love; they just kept on going,” Roos-Collins said. “It was pretty clear they had seen us.”</p>\n<p>Help was nowhere to be found, and the group knew they had no choice but to finish the trip. Establishing their compass angle again, the kayakers set off to reach Anacapa Island before the close of day.</p>\n<p>After a few hours more paddling through heavy fog, the kayakers were in close enough proximity to the island to see its ghostly shape. It was at this point, Frey said, that the group realized their incorrect compass angle nearly led them to miss the island entirely.</p>\n<p>The kayakers immediately corrected their bearings, pointing the tips of vessels toward the large land mass in the distance. With strong winds at their sides, however, the kayakers had to angle themselves in such a way that the wind would hit the tail of the kayak.</p>\n<p>“Coming to that island was glorious,” Frey said. “Being able to see the island was great. If we couldn’t see the island, then there’s a very likely chance we wouldn’t have made it.”</p>\n<p>The kayakers finally reached the shores of Anacapa Island at 4 p.m., approximately eight hours after first launching from Oxnard.</p>\n<p>Roos-Collins said their arrival greatly surprised the park ranger, who before that point was the only other person on the narrow archipelago composed mostly of jagged volcanic basalt. The primary occupants of the island were thousands of seagulls, highly aggressive during mating season.</p>\n<p>The group set up camp for the night in a site that they had reserved prior to embarking on the trip. They sat atop a high rock formation and enjoyed what Roos-Collins called “one of the most satisfying sunsets” he had ever seen.</p>\n<p>Daniel Connell, fourth-year financial math and statistics major, said the linguini that they ate that night was the highlight of the trip.</p>\n<p>The six kayakers spent the next morning freediving and exploring the island’s various caves until a pre-booked ferry picked them up in the afternoon and took them back to the mainland.</p>\n<p>On their ferry trip back, the six students and alumni shared a beer, reveling in a trip that had turned out to be a success despite many setbacks along the way.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78409\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78409\" data-attachment-id=\"78409\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/channel-surfers-battle-rough-seas-in-13-mile-voyage/kayakers-3-court-of-byron-roos-collins/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?fit=2048%2C1134&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1134\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"kayakers 3 court of Byron Roos-Collins\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?fit=250%2C138&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?fit=888%2C492&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78409 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins-1024x567.jpg?resize=888%2C492\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"492\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?resize=1024%2C567&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?resize=250%2C138&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?resize=768%2C425&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kayakers-3-court-of-Byron-Roos-Collins.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78409\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">After spending the next morning freediving and exploring the island’s various caves, the six kayakers enjoyed a beer on their a pre-booked ferry back to the mainland. <em>Courtesy of Byron Roos-Collins</em></p></div>\n<p>Set to graduate in a little over a week, Roos-Collins said no other adventure he embarked on in the past year can top last month’s trek to Anacapa Island.</p>\n<p>For Connell, who will also be graduating soon, the kayak trip ranks “damn near the top” among his overall experiences as a UCSB student.</p>\n<p>“We’re fortunate enough to have ocean views from our homes currently, and waking up in the morning and going out on the deck and actually seeing those islands in the distance is kind of a constant reminder of the journey,” Connell said. “I can kind of look in the distance and see where we encountered some sharks and where we were eating salami.

(S.A.N.) at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2016. At the time, he was prepared to organize social justice movements under a Clinton presidency.</p>\n<p>When Donald Trump won the election, Villalobos had to change his plans.</p>\n<p>“I threw myself more into S.A.N. It’s like a full time job for me,” Villalobos said.</p>\n<p>The Student Activist Network is a student-run social justice organization that organizes demonstrations and protests for racial justice, gender equality, immigration, workers’ rights and other issues</p>\n<p>Since Election Day 2016, the network has organized and participated in several on-campus and local demonstrations, including protests after election day, a May Day rally for laborer rights, a rally against rape culture and a sit-in at Cheadle Hall with Fossil Free UCSB.</p>\n<p>Mayela Morales, a fourth-year Chican@ studies and global studies double major, is the head organizer of S.A.N. She became involved in student activism when she started taking Chican@ studies courses at UCSB.</p>\n<p>The biggest change Morales has witnessed in the U.S. since Trump became president is an increase in outward racism throughout the nation.</p>\n<p>She said Trump’s policies, like the administration’s travel ban in March and the repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in September, have spurred racist rhetoric and sentiments.</p>\n<p>“It always comes back to targeting a community in particular,” she said. “Racism has become more blunt — it’s just straight up in your face.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a more organized racism and misogyny,” Villalobos said, agreeing with Morales. “It’s here, it’s present and we’ll organize against it.”</p>\n<p>Racial justice is one of the Student Activist Network’s seven key issues, Villalobos said.</p>\n<p>The group has an organized a caucus for each of the seven issues: racial justice, feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, immigration, the environment, workers’ rights and student movements.</p>\n<p>Morales said many of the caucuses have organized projects in direct relation to the Trump administration’s policies, including Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos’s repeal of Obama-era Title IX policies.</p>\n<p>The feminist caucus, for example, is collaborating with Ro Earvin, a UCSB student who presented a list of demands to Chancellor Henry T. Yang in May to reform how the university handles sexual violence.</p>\n<p>S.A.N. is also working to create anti-war and anti-police caucuses, Villalobos said.</p>\n<p>On Monday, the Student Activist Network printed 500 copies of its “Disorientation Guide,” a booklet that contains historical information about student movements and activism at UCSB, as well as information on labor unions and housing cooperatives.</p>\n<p>“When you come to the university, you get an orientation packet,” Villalobos said. “This is the same thing except it’s from a radical perspective. This shows students [UCSB] is not just a place where you go to class, get your degree and leave.”</p>\n<p>Villalobos said the “Disorientation Guide” will helps students understand the impact students have made on UCSB’s history and know how to better organize against oppression today.</p>\n<p>“When I started S.A.N., it was a piece of beat-up notebook paper,” Villalobos said, reflecting on how much the organization and its structure have changed in the past year.</p>\n<p>Today, the group has a head organizer, an internal organizer, treasurer, a meeting facilitator and a central organizing committee.</p>\n<p>The network also holds core organizing meetings, during which the board discusses long term plans, and general body meetings, in which all caucuses meet together to work on their projects.</p>\n<p>The Student Activist Network is open to anyone interested in joining<strong>, </strong>Villalobos said, which is an aspect of the organization he believes makes it unique on campus.</p>\n<p>“We’re a radical student group, but we accept everyone,” he said, adding that without limits based on political affiliation or identity, the network is able to address a variety of social issues that affect different groups.</p>\n<p>Villalobos also said the Student Activist Network wants to educate more incoming students about the history of movement-based activism and getting involved.</p>\n<p>“The university is a site of struggle, and historically there’s been a lot of action,” he said.</p>\n<p>Villalobos, who will graduate at the end of Fall Quarter, said he wants to keep students engaged with movement-based politics even after the Trump presidency.</p>\n<p>While the Trump administration has inspired more people to become activists, Villalobos said, movements against racism, transphobia, misogyny and gender inequality have always existed.</p>\n<p>“There’s the resistance to all these things that have existed before [Trump] and will exist afterwards,” he added. “They have to be resisted either way.”</p>\n<p>As the Student Activist Network looks toward the future, Villalobos said it is important for students to remain resilient and dedicated to social justice even after Trump leaves office.</p>\n<p>“The message has been like the Democrats aren’t going to save you, the elections aren’t going to save you necessarily,” he said. “We have to save ourselves.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Nov. 9 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Dan Wilson, police received a report that a screaming noise and gunshot sound were heard near the east campus dorms at about 10:29 p.m.</p>\n<p>Wilson said at 10:58 p.m. that “we’re not able to find any type of evidence that there was a gunshot.”</p>\n<p>UCPD would likely rule the lockdown a false alarm if they did not find any evidence pointing to a shooter, Wilson said.</p>\n<p>Police followed up on the initial report and conducted checks of the area surrounding the east campus residence halls.</p>\n<p>Police determined that the threat was “false and unfounded” after searching the area, according to Wilson.
