Tenants Union (IVTU) spoke during the open forum about students displaced from Del Playa due to the cliff erosion. They have created a $15,000 emergency fund and asked Senate to match these funds to ensure that students have access to new housing, financial support, moving support and legal assistance.</p>\n<p>Senate voted to pass a resolution to match this funding, giving up to $300 per displaced UCSB student. SBCC students will not be eligible.</p>\n<p>IVTU is also creating an emergency protocol to ensure that students’ needs are met and that students are aware of their rights and responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Senate also approved a resolution on the “festival ordinance” in relation to Deltopia, changing the dates of the ordinance to include April 1, 2, 6, 7, 8 and 9. The bill also aims to increase the role of the external vice president of local affairs in the discussion of the ordinance and open communication between the community and the police.</p>\n<p>They also voted on a resolution regarding advertisements aired on social media discouraging students from coming to I.V. to attend Deltopia.</p>\n<p>Senator Cole Marting expressed concern about a lack of public data about the effectiveness of the advertising and added a stipulation to the resolution asking that the university provide Senate with data.</p>\n<p>The resolution passed with 19 senators in support. Senator Ashley Selki abstained.</p>\n<p>As for items discussed, the meeting began with a statement from Gina Fischer, a representative for Third District County Supervisor Joan Hartmann, about the installation of traffic light at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Norte.</p>\n<p>Senator Batsheva Stoll expressed concern over the 10 minute intervals between classes when students rush through Pardall, and whether timing on the street lights might affect this.</p>\n<p>“We watch it and make minor tweaks to it to make it run as efficiently as possible,” Scott McGolpin, Santa Barbara public works director, said.</p>\n<p>Senators also discussed law enforcement at the stoplight.</p>\n<p>Stoll said “people will be angry with a $200 traffic ticket,” but Deputy James McKarrell said there would first be an educational period ensuring that students understand proper safety, followed by a probationary period with heavy police presence to give out warnings to students who did not obey the light.</p>\n<p>“If we don’t see a change, then we will have an enforcement period,” McKarrell said. “My job is not to necessarily be out here and have you like me; it’s to make sure you get home to your parents.”</p>\n<p>There was also a discussion regarding anti-Semitism that was discussed during the last Senate meeting, with Jack Tannenbaum, third-year economics major, expressing extreme disapproval of the way Senate handled a discussion about anti-Semitism during last week’s meeting.</p>\n<p>“It’s a right of any minority group to define what hate against themselves is,” he said. “It’s extremely inappropriate to diminish harm students are feeling because it’s late at night.”</p>\n<p>Senators all expressed their support. Senator Marting said he had taken the time to fully understand anti-Semitism, and Natalie Jordan said they would consider doing more trainings to help further understanding.</p>\n<p>The meeting concluded with a statement by Steven Kwok, director of legislative accountability, expressing his disappointment in the lack of engagement by senators with BCUs.</p>\n<p>“I do want to stress how important your presence at meetings is,” he said. “There are a lot of people doing work out there, and I’m not sure how much you know about it.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 23, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Discussion items included the introduction and approval of a new process for distributing honoraria, or monetary compensation, for Program Board officers. Other discussion items included honoraria bill for the Commission on Disability Equality (CODE) that was tabled indefinitely for consideration by the honoraria committee, and a bill to further availability and access of information in A.S. elections code, which was passed.</p>\n<p>Requests granted by the committee included $450 to the University Affairs Committee for honoraria for three student members, $250 for the External Affairs Committee, $75 for the On Campus Senator’s event focused on healthy, productive study foods from the Isla Vista Co-op, $10,550 for the Black Graduates group, $3,840 for La Famille de Colores for tickets and flights for an upcoming conference, $4,000 for the Impact Movement’s national conference in Chicago, $147 for Vocal Motion a cappella group’s fall concert, $80 for Delta Sigma Zeta’s scantrons and bluebooks for a group study session, $400 for the Catalyst Literary Art Magazine third issue launch party, specifically for publicity purposes, to provide propane to keep their upcoming event area warm as well as to provide sculpture transportation.</p>\n<p>The Asian American Christian group EPIC requested and was approved to receive $3,000 for an annual conference held in Orange County at the Doubletree Hotel.<br>\nOfficer for EPIC and fourth-year student Esther Euseon said they needed funding because of their particularly large group this year.</p>\n<p>“We are actually, this year, the largest Christian Asian-American organization on campus,” Euseon said. “We love it when anybody comes to our events.”</p>\n<p>Finance and Business Committee member and second-year history of public policy major Izeah Garcia said EPIC is very inclusive as a Christian organization, unlike other religious groups on campus.</p>\n<p>“”I’ve been to Epic and I’m not Protestant or Christian, in that sense I am Catholic, and honestly they’re pretty chill,” Garcia said. “When organizations say ‘Oh yeah we’re very inclusive,’ it’s hard for people to think they can get into those spaces, but I think with specifically religious organizations they try to make it so they’re as inclusiveness possible.”</p>\n<p>The Art Club requested money for two different events, totaling $1,750, but both were tabled. Representatives from the club will attempt to get money from the Art Department before re-requesting from the Finance Board.</p>\n<p>The Cheer Team also received funding for registration as well as lodging for the USA Nationals competition in Anaheim and a separate competition in Atlanta. The delegated amount was $2,750 out of the $16,780 the team had requested for transportation for future cheer competitions.</p>\n<p>One of Cheer Team’s captains and third-year film and media studies major Nick Gorton-Bufano said this is the first time since 2003 that the team has had both females and males.</p>\n<p>“This is the first year that we’ve been coed since 2003, so that’s cool,” Gorton-Bufano said. “And we gained a lot of support at basketball games from people because we’re co-ed. So we are trying to grow the co-ed aspect as well.”</p>\n<p>Model United Nations also requested $7,332 for extra transportation and housing for their annual Berkeley conference, and received $1,426 to pay for registration fees.</p>\n<p>UCen UStudy, a service that keeps the UCen open for longer than average hours during finals week, received $700 of the $1,085 they asked for to pay for building management to keep Corwin Pavilion open from 1 a.m. – 6 a.m. and to pay for a massage therapist. The Excursion Club received $950 of the $2,750 they requested for I.V. First Fridays, a new events series made to draw people away from Del Playa Drive and the house party scene to provide a large scale source of entertainment in through a variety of activities in I.V., held on the first Friday of every month.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A prior version of this article incorrectly quoted Izeah Garcia as saying ““I’ve been to EPIC and I’m not Protestant or Catholic and honestly they’re pretty chill.” Garcia actually said “I’ve been to Epic and I’m not Protestant or Christian in that sense I am Catholic.” The article has been updated accordingly.]</p><div

UC Santa Barbara has four dining commons across campus, and the building construction will make Portola the university’s largest dining common.</p>\n<p>The Portola Dining Commons are located near the Santa Catalina freshmen dorms on El Colegio Road.</p>\n<p>According to UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada, the building construction cost approximately $20.37 million.</p>\n<p>The original design of the dining commons began in 2013, according to KieranTimberlake, the architecture firm that designed Portola. Construction began in 2015 after the firm completed the building design in 2014.</p>\n<p>“We are really excited to see this project come to life,” Jill Horst, director of dining services, said in an email. “I can’t wait for our guests to walk [through] the doors and experience this amazing venue while exploring a culinary feast-food innovation at its best with flavors forward.”</p>\n<p>According to Horst, the old dining commons contained approximately 450 seats, while the new building has 600 indoor seats and 200 seats on the outdoor patio. The university is in the process of hiring more student and full-time employees to accommodate the increase in the dining commons’ capacity.</p>\n<p>The Portola Dining Commons will be supplied with specialized cooking equipment, including a tandoori oven, rotisserie oven and tortilla machine in the bakery.</p>\n<p>Students will also be able to see their food prepared through the six open kitchens, said Carin Whitney, spokesperson from KieranTimberlake, adding that the cooking and serving areas of the dining commons are “integral” to its overall design.</p>\n<p>“The culinary experience is architectural,” Whitney said in an email.</p>\n<p>Whitney said the university and architecture team considered the dining commons’ environmental effects in its design and operation, including energy-efficient cooking equipment, sustainable food service practices and a solar hot water system for washing dishes.</p>\n<p>“The team expects high performance benchmarks once [the] building opens for service,” Whitney said in an email.</p>\n<p><em>Update: The cost of the Portola Dining Commons’ construction was unavailable at the time of publication and has since been added to the article. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, August 24, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Suck Black D*ck Doesn’t Mean You’re Not Racist,” was part of the 18 total Pride Week events throughout Apr. 10-18. Johari Hunt, the event host and a first-year chemistry major, discussed queer history, racism, sexualization of black bodies and the intersection of people of color, social media and the LGBTQ community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event began with a discussion about queer history and what the minority community within the LGBTQ community looked like throughout the 1900s, specifically “drag ball culture” and the houses in New York that acted as safe spaces and cultural havens for the LGBTQ community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt went on to define racism, prejudice and how the “system of advantage based on race” allows society to understand various forms of oppression. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Racism isn’t defined by someone saying the n-word, but its systematic and institutional,” he said in an interview. “It is whenever a black person says they’re afraid of police. It is being seen as a criminal before you’re even seen as a child.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Racism] is … a system involving cultural messages and institutional policies and practices as well as the beliefs and actions of individuals,” Hunt added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connecting racism and prejudice to the perceptions and stereotypes of masculinity and femininity within the LGBTQ community led to an engaged discussion at the event about the intersections of social media, people of color and the LGBTQ community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt’s final segment focused on HIV/AIDS history and the fact that HIV and AIDS transmission within the black community has been neglected in conversations about sex. This has led to a lack of visibility about the topic, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During audience discussion, audience members pointed out the history of United States Vice President Mike Pence and the LGBT community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an archived version of </span><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20010519165033fw_/http:/cybertext.net/pence/issues.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Vice President Pence’s 2000 congressional campaign addressed the issue of the Ryan White Care Act, which provides federal funding for </span><a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/aids/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HIV</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">/AIDS patients and was reauthorized by Congress that year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website stated that reauthorization of the act should be completed only after an audit to ensure that federal funding would not be given to organizations that “celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website also stated that funding and resources “should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the World Health Organization, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 70 million people have been infected with HIV, and about 35 million people have died of HIV. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2015, 1.1 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses worldwide, and Sub-Saharan Africa remains most severely affected.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76975\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76975\"

experiences, like being black and gay or living with HIV, that are not in a research paper or in an article, need to be talked about,” Hunt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt said the hardest part of organizing the event was putting something so blatant into context. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt said he wanted the audience to start a conversation about what it means to be a minority group in the LGBT community and learn about different life experiences within the LGBT community that most people do not realize exist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the process of creating the event, Hunt said he thought about issues that gay men face “all the time” and found that masculinity, and what it means to be masculine, is a critical concern.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Then it went to being black as perceived,” Hunt said. “And then I reached the actual sexualization of black bodies.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt said he felt the event presented his central points openly enough to promote and discuss as well as establish future conversations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He wanted his audience to leave “not with answers, but with the willingness to look for them.”</span></p><div
