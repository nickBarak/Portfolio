The remaining 97 votes went toward other Democratic and third-party candidates.</p>\n<p>Nearly 90 percent of voters chose to support Democratic candidates at the polls. Abboud said Sanders’s strong lead was likely due to support from the Sanders campaign support throughout campus and I.V.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t just that people wanted to vote for Bernie, but Bernie helped get people politically aware,” Abboud said. “A lot of the people we talked to knew about the issues very early on, so it was a good year.”</p>\n<p>The voter turnout among UCSB students and I.V. residents is even more astonishing because the primary election was held on last week of the quarter, when most students were completing final exams.</p>\n<p>“The numbers … show the level of organization and volunteer efforts here for the primary were extremely higher than average,” Abboud said. “The whole campaign was centered around driving turnout, because the primary was during finals week.”</p>\n<p>Abboud also noted that UCSB and I.V. voters will be especially important to the general election in November because of specific ballot measures, such as a marijuana legalization bill and the vote for I.V. to become a Community Services District (CSD).</p>\n<p>“The Isla Vista Community Services District election is in November and that is the most direct thing anyone could ever vote on to make Isla Vista a better place,” Abboud said. “So we believe that the excitement and the promise of CSD plus the importance of all the other races of elected office and the wide array of propositions on the ballot will be driving factors for people to vote.”</p>\n<p>Voters in Santa Barbara also selected candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the state senate, assembly and the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors. Final results will be determined after the general election on Nov. 8.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, June 23, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: A previous version of this story said Clinton had won the Democratic presidential nomination, she has not yet secured the nomination.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Guest House, which began renovations in 2014, welcomed UCSB students and staff to its grand opening ceremony on Jan. 31. The $30 million project was financed primarily by a 30-year, $12.84 million loan.<em> Campbell Nolan / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Marc Fisher, vice chancellor for campus design and facilities, the original building needed renovation because of building damage and a lack of modern conveniences such as an elevator.</p>\n<p>The heating, plumbing and electrical systems had all been in place since the building’s construction in 1968 and were at risk of failure.</p>\n<p>In order to make The Club economically viable, the university added 30 guest rooms to the four remaining original rooms after two were torn down in the course of renovation.</p>\n<p>The total cost of the building was $20.6 million, $1 million of which was donated by Betty Elings Wells, a frequent donor to UCSB.</p>\n<p>The project took a year longer than expected because of unforeseen soil conditions, as well as discrepancies between the working drawings from the 1960s and the actual condition of the faculty club.</p>\n<p>The renovation was partially financed by a 30-year loan, which is standard for large buildings, according to Chuck Haines, the acting assistant chancellor for the Office of Budget and Planning. The loan totals $12.84 million and has a 3.78 percent interest rate.</p>\n<p>Haines estimates that the interest payments will come out to around $9 million, pushing the total cost of the project to about $30 million.</p>\n<p>The university expects revenue from The Club to pay for the cost of the building. According to Haines, UCSB will not use student tuition dollars to finance the building.</p>\n<p>According to Robert Kelley, UCSB historian, the original faculty club was completed in 1968 at the suggestion of Professor Steven Horvath.</p>\n<p>Horvath insisted that the building be a distinguished venue for visiting guests as well as faculty and community gatherings and that it be by the lagoon to capture a “serene ambiance.”</p>\n<p>Fisher said the campus had explored the possibility of relocating The Club to a different location or repurposing the old building, but the university felt strongly that the location’s historical significance be preserved.</p>\n<p>The new building, which overlooks the lagoon, has 34 guest rooms, a bar and lounge, private meeting and conference areas and a terrace.</p>\n<p>Room rates start at $270 for non-members and $230 for members. In addition to paying off the loan, revenue from The Club will also support the staff and building upkeep.</p>\n<p>“The Club &amp; Guest House at UC Santa Barbara is designed to serve the temporary housing needs of University-affiliated guests and individuals conducting University business,” the building’s website says.</p>\n<p>In order to accommodate the limited space and high demand, guests who wish to stay at The Club must be attending a campus event or visit, be a club member, visiting faculty or conducting university business.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, Feb. 9, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Higher Education’s (AASHE) Sustainability Tracking, Assessment &amp; Rating System (S.T.A.R.S.). UCSB also received a gold ranking in 2014.</p>\n<p>AASHE received submissions from 800 schools in 30 countries. The association’s rating system allows universities to track their progress in improving campus sustainability.</p>\n<p>UCSB received 73.4 points out of a possible 100, with a nearly perfect score in diversity and accessibility, but it fell short in curriculum, energy and food and dining.</p>\n<p>The S.T.A.R.S. report found that more than half of all students at UCSB felt that courses generally incorporated diverse perspectives, and a significant majority of the school community is satisfied with the overall climate.</p>\n<p>“Social equity is critical,” Mo Lovegreen, the director of campus sustainability who spearheaded the submission, said. “As we’ve grown, we’ve been more inclusive, and we figured out methodologies to make sure we’re more inclusive.”</p>\n<p>Despite the high diversity score, the report details areas for improvement in the university, citing that 24 percent of respondents believed they had experienced exclusionary or offensive conduct, and 3 percent of respondents saying they had experienced unwanted sexual contact.</p>\n<p>The report also showed a significant weakness in learning outcomes, with UCSB receiving only .95 out of eight points. Out of the 3,773 courses offered, only 102 address the interconnectivity between humans and the environment.</p>\n<p>“I don’t agree from the perspective of academic freedom,” Lovegreen said. “You can’t require all disciplines to teach [sustainability], but we’ve done, I think, amazing on our campus [because] there are that many departments that are offering content about the environment and sustainability.”</p>\n<p>The university offers incentives such as New Leaf grants to help incorporate sustainability into other courses, as well as faculty members who are helping to incorporate sustainability in courses.</p>\n<p>Food and beverage purchasing was also a weak category, with UCSB receiving .95 out of six points.</p>\n<p>The submission process, which took over 800 hours, began early last year, according to Lovegreen. The process took longer than expected due to a change in the requirements and was ultimately finished on Nov. 8, costing around $3,200 in wages for student interns who helped compile the report.</p>\n<p>“We’re glad they’re over, so now we can get onto other stuff. We are ecstatic about that,” Lovegreen said. “We only do it every other year because it’s so time intensive. We have to make progress on our campus on other areas.”</p>\n<p>Despite the large time commitment, Lovegreen said she believes the program is worth the time because it allows the university to gauge its progress and rank against other schools. The S.T.A.R.S. award also helps the university decide what steps should be taken for further improvement, she said.</p>\n<p>Lovegreen said she hopes to improve the ranking to platinum, the program’s highest available ranking, by 2020. It will take many small steps in a variety of areas, she said, and will also include larger action aligning with Janet Napolitano’s carbon neutrality initiative.</p>\n<p>“It’s just crafting a plan,” Lovegreen said. “How hard is that?”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, Feb. 9, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.
