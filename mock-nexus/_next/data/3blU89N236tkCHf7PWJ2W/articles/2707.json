Finance and Business Committee for an upcoming event featuring Ben Shapiro, a political commentator who will present a criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>\n<p>Shapiro, former editor of conservative news source Breitbart, last <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-13/fox-contributor-speaks-on-guns-media-at-ucsb/\" target=\"_blank\">spoke at UCSB</a> in 2013. He has previously been banned from speaking engagements at other universities and was escorted off the CSU Los Angeles campus in May 2016 due to protests.</p>\n<p>During the College Republicans’ lengthy presentation, speakers swore more than once and had to field multiple questions from the finance and business committee, including doubts about safety.</p>\n<p>“Our purpose is not to be offensive for the sake of being offensive; that’s childish, and no one wants that,” Andrew Gates, president of College Republicans, told the <em>Nexus</em>. “We believe that offering a different perspective would open a civil dialogue.”</p>\n<p>The group asked for $350 to reserve Corwin Pavilion, $650 for security and $4,000 for Shapiro’s speaker fee.</p>\n<p>The hefty security budget of $650 highlights an underlying risk of violence. Gates has organized similar events in the past and reassured the committee there would be no tolerance for any form of violence.</p>\n<p>“We won’t assault anyone,” he said at the meeting.</p>\n<p>Two attendees in support of College Republicans were seated at the front of the room wearing “Make America Great Again” hats, drawing looks of disapproval from other audience members.</p>\n<p>Shapiro has been vocal in his criticism in the Black Lives Matter movement, saying that it lacks values and acts as a source of violence.</p>\n<p>“Obviously, Ben Shapiro has a message, and we agree with that message,” Gates said, “Anyone who thinks he’s irrational or immoral or the worst person ever is free to [say] so at the Q&amp;A portion of the event.”</p>\n<p>“I understand the purpose of the Black Lives Matter movement; I understand the reasoning behind the name,” Gates said, but added that he takes issue with how statistics are applied to support assertions of inequality in black communities.</p>\n<p>Gates also said it’s unfair to suggest that white people cannot be subject to racism.</p>\n<p>“It’s sort of a clever way of in academia to get away with saying shitty things about white people,” he said.</p>\n<p>After heated discussion between committee members, finance and business committee chairman Reilly Hobson interjected, reminding everyone that ideology does not influence whether a group should receive funding.</p>\n<p>After an initial objection, followed by a vote with seven members voting to approve funding and four members abstaining, College Republicans were granted the funds.</p>\n<p>They are pursuing additional funding from Young Americans for Liberty as well as other conservative political organizations in the Santa Barbara area.</p>\n<p>The funding is pending approval by the A.S. Senate during Wednesday’s meeting at 6:30 p.m. in the Flying A Room of the UCen.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73657\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/a-s-to-fund-college-republicans-event-featuring-ben-shapiro/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73657\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/a-s-to-fund-college-republicans-event-featuring-ben-shapiro/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/a-s-to-fund-college-republicans-event-featuring-ben-shapiro/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/a-s-to-fund-college-republicans-event-featuring-ben-shapiro/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/a-s-to-fund-college-republicans-event-featuring-ben-shapiro/","id":2707,"author":{"id":109,"name":"Brandon Chen"},"related":[2706,2705,2704],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":109,"name":"Brandon Chen","biography":"Not available","articles":[2707],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"First Students Move Into Sierra Madre Villages","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sierra_Anna-Gagliardo-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sierra_Anna-Gagliardo-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB’s Housing & Residential Services opened Sierra Madre Village Apartments on Storke Road this fall to accommodate an increase in student enrollment and faculty members.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_64946\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64946\" data-attachment-id=\"64946\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/first-students-move-into-sierra-madre-villages/sierra_anna-gagliardo-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sierra_Anna-Gagliardo-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1440&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1440\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"7.1\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3000\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1332320589\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Sierra_Anna Gagliardo-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sierra_Anna-Gagliardo-1.jpg?fit=250%2C180&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sierra_Anna-Gagliardo-1.jpg?fit=888%2C639&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64946 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sierra_Anna-Gagliardo-1-1024x737.jpg?resize=888%2C639\" alt=\"Parts of Sierra Madre Villages which are not finished are scheduled for completion in two or three weeks.

The apartments consist of several three-story buildings and 109 total apartment spaces with three varying floor plans. Parts of the complex are still under construction, including faculty housing and the administration and recreation buildings scheduled for completion in the next two to three weeks.</p>\n<p>Third-year feminist studies and sociology double major Kevin Tang said he was assigned to live in Sierra Madre; he enjoys living there and prefers it over his apartment at Santa Ynez last year.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t choose to live here; I got randomly assigned, but I like it a lot. It’s nice to have a new apartment and not have to share a shower with more than one person,” Tang said in an email. “I lived in Santa Ynez before and it definitely a lot nicer [here], especially the new appliances, also there’s a lot less ants.”</p>\n<p>Third-year communication major Allie Lobos said she chose to live at Sierra Madre and though the new apartments are clean, she dislikes the 1.8 mile commute to campus.</p>\n<p>“Living here is great. It’s new, it’s clean, but I wish I did live in Isla Vista,” Lobos said. “My biggest complaint is the distance; I have three 8 a.m.s a week.”</p>\n<p>Tang said despite the distance, he would be willing to choose to live in Sierra Madre Village Apartments again.</p>\n<p>“It’s kind of far and taking the bus can be annoying when I miss it and become late for class, but I like it a lot and would choose to live here again,” Tang said again, in an email.</p>\n<p>Third-year communication major and transfer student Vanessa Guevara said she likes living farther from campus and closer to the supermarkets, and she is looking forward to the completion of the convenience store and recreational building.</p>\n<p>“I like how far it is; it feels more secluded from the main campus and it’s close to groceries,” Guevara said in an email. “I hope the store and gym opens soon though. I bike so it’s not really a problem and the living space is nice especially since it was just built.”</p>\n<p>Project Executive Joe Linden said the administration and recreation building will be completed in two to three weeks’ time, and until then students will be surrounded in a loud environment. Linden also said the faculty building which burned down July 4, 2014 is nearing completion.</p>\n<p>“Everything is on schedule but some community buildings still have about two weeks left,” Linden said. “Building seven which is located by Whittier and Storke Road has two to three weeks left as well.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 1 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

University architects and planners believe the crosswalk plan will enhance safety and create easy access between the two sides of El Colegio and Storke Road.</p>\n<h3 align=\"JUSTIFY\">Visiting Scholars’ Residence for the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP)</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_72581\" style=\"width: 3010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"374399950\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72566\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72581\" data-attachment-id=\"72581\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/campus-construction-chugs-along/kitp-visiting-scholars-residence-isla-vista-aug-19th-2016-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg?fit=3000%2C1622&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,1622\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"KITP Visiting Scholar’s Residence, Isla Vista, Aug 19th 2016.\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg?fit=250%2C135&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg?fit=888%2C480&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72581\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg?resize=888%2C480\" alt=\"Hari Patel / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg?resize=250%2C135&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg?resize=768%2C415&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C554&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Visiting-Scholars-Residence-by-Hari-Patel-PRINT-3.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72581\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Hari Patel / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Spanning 75,000-square-feet, the large visiting scholars’ residence next to the San Clemente apartments is slated to open the first week of January 2017.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The development was announced in October 2015 as an addition to UCSB’s storied KITP. The main location of the research program is the orange porthole building next to the Channel Islands Five (Chi-5) Residence Halls.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The residence on El Colegio Road will include meeting rooms, shared kitchens, dining rooms, a gym and 61 apartment-style, fully-furnished private bedrooms with private bathrooms.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">All developments have gone as planned, according to KITP residence manager James Brill, and the building will soon allow for “unhampered creative exchange” between all visiting scientists.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Charles Munger, business partner of Warren Buffett, made the construction possible by donating $65 million to KITP. More recently, he committed $200 million to UCSB to replace the Chi-5 dorms with more modern amenities. The plan is still running through several stages of approval.</p>\n<h3 align=\"JUSTIFY\">Faculty Club Construction</h3>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The faculty club is a reiteration of an earlier faculty residence and conference area, first designed by Charles W.

stronger community while playing games and enjoying food.</em> Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Isla Vista Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) will host the seventh annual Pardall Carnival Oct. 3 from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. on Pardall Road.</p>\n<p>The carnival will feature a Ferris wheel, games, prizes, free food and more than 60 different campus organizations and local businesses, including UCSB Health &amp; Wellness, the I.V. Food Co-op, A.S. Food Bank, the Commission on Student Well-Being (COSWEB) and KCSB-FM. IVCRC plans to hold many food-related activities to fulfil its goal of focusing on food security and food justice this year.</p>\n<p>IVCRC advisor Ruth Guevara Garcia said the carnival is meant to strengthen the I.V. community in the recently restored central area.</p>\n<p>“Pardall Carnival was established in 2009 as a way to highlight the renovation of Pardall Road and bring students and kids living in Isla Vista together,” Garcia said.<br>\nIVCRC external chair Aimee Hanna said A.S. Food Bank and COSWB will provide services at the event.</p>\n<p>“A.S Food Bank’s table that will be hosting a food distribution, as well as UCSB’s COSWB will be there providing free yoga to carnival-goers,” Hanna said.</p>\n<p>Hanna said IVCRC will reward game participants at the carnival with “Pardollas,” which they redeem at I.V. restaurants on the day of the event.</p>\n<p>“If people participate in any of the free games we have going on, they will receive Pardollas in which they can use in restaurants that are participating to score deals on free food,” Hanna said.</p>\n<p>According to IVCRC publicity manager and third-year global studies major Lauren Lim, the carnival will feature free activities music from KCSB-FM.</p>\n<p>“We really want to emphasize that there will be tons of free giveaways and games to participate in,” Lim said. “I’m really excited about KCSB attending and providing cool DJ sets for people to listen to while they’re there as well.”</p>\n<p>Lim said IVCRC expects a large turnout at the carnival.</p>\n<p>“We have over 1,000 people that have RSVPed on the Facebook event, but we are anticipating way more than that to attend on the day of,” Lim said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 1 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64948\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/carnival-to-feature-games-food/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64948\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/carnival-to-feature-games-food/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/carnival-to-feature-games-food/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/carnival-to-feature-games-food/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/carnival-to-feature-games-food/","id":2704,"author":{"id":142,"name":"Erin Kownacki"},"related":[2703,2702,2701],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
