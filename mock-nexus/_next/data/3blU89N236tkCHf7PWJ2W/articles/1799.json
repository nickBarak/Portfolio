Full-time employees are eligible for 128 hours of paid leave, while part-time employees are receiving a proportional amount. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for many student employees who send money home to support their families or juggle multiple jobs to pay their way through college, paid administrative leave or </span><a href=\"https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/work-study-and-covid-19-information\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remote work study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> isn’t enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stevie Mendoza, a second-year sociology major who worked at the Carrillo Dining Commons, is experiencing this firsthand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After I pay rent, I always have a little extra money, and I don’t spend a lot of money on food, being able to eat at Carrillo, so I keep a little extra cash and send it back home to help out,” Mendoza said. “I’m really stressed out because I help my parents with money for their phone bills and utilities, and [I] have always been able to help out.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mendoza said she was frustrated by the ambivalence of the dining commons’ upper management, who at first assured the student workers that “we would keep our jobs” after news that spring quarter would be held </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remotely</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> began to circulate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That quickly changed, however. “A lot of people were waiting on canceling their housing contracts to work, and then they waited to tell us that, ‘Oh yeah, by the way, you no longer have a job.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to UCSB Spokesperson Andrea Estrada, “Campus Dining has not let any student employees go” for good. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mendoza said she is unable to go home and has to stay in I.V. and pay rent but is now out of a job. Though her employment may be restored in the future, researchers predict that a return to normalcy could be months away, The Atlantic </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-summer-coronavirus-reopening-back-normal/609940/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> With few options left, Medoza filed for unemployment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now I don’t even have an income for myself. So it’s not only scary for me but scary for my family back home. There’s no income for me to pay rent and I’m just working off my savings, which I’m lucky I have as a college student,” Mendoza said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But I also don’t have enough to help [my parents] anymore,” she added. “And my mom lost her job, too.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mendoza is not alone. JoAnn Vo, a second-year biology major and an usher for Arts and Lectures, learned she had lost her job after reading a chain of emails sent out to Arts and Lectures employees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t hear anything about losing my job until they sent an email out,” Vo said. “First it was an email like, ‘We’re canceling all events.’ And then there was a second email [adding], ‘Oh, we’re also firing the entire student department.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vo, like Mendoza, also felt that the upper management of Arts and Lectures was “very opaque” in its communication with students and poorly conveyed how students would be affected. Though she is now home and looking for a new job, Vo said Arts and Lectures did say it was offering online positions for the time being but has not made a decision on rehiring students for on-campus jobs in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think [the students] who got the worst out of all of it were those who worked at the dining commons,” Vo said. “I’m kind of glad I had my position, to be honest.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Thunderdome, much like the dining commons, the University Library and most dorms, is now an echo chamber. With all UCSB sports </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-12/big-west-basketball-tournament-cancelled/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">canceled</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the rest of the year and the NCAA season </span><a href=\"https://www.ncaa.com/live-updates/ncaa-cancels-remaining-winter-and-spring-championships-due-coronavirus-concerns\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cut short</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, few employees are left to maintain the Thunderdome’s glossy hardwood floor, according to Denice Barba-Medina, a second-year sociology major who works at the Thunderdome. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was a really fun job. We got to watch events, like the basketball games, and then afterwards cleaned up and made sure the Thunderdome was ready for whatever other events we have,” she said. “I guess you could say we’re kind of glorified janitors.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike Vo’s and Mendoza’s experiences with the upper management of their respective employers, Barba-Medina appreciated the lengths to which her bosses tried to give her hours. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My supervisors are awesome and so is the manager. They were trying to find whatever hours they could to scrape up so that way whoever does decide to stay on campus can work, maybe like 10 to 15 hours per pay period,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barba-Medina, who lived in San Rafael Residence Hall, said she ultimately took the housing reimbursement and went home, foregoing her job at the Thunderdome and her income. But “we’re not completely laid off,” she said, adding that “we just don’t have the ability to work remotely.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although she plans to return to her job when she can, Barba-Medina said she is grateful to be at home and acknowledges that “I’m coming from a place of privilege, and even if I didn’t get anything back, I know I’d be okay.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My parents are pretty good right now. They weren’t hit too hard. My mom is a stay-at-home mom, but my dad is a truck driver. So for him, he’s been working a ton right now because he’s one of those essential jobs at the moment,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But money aside, Barba-Medina said she, like many other students at UCSB, is saddened by the abrupt loss of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-30/i-didnt-have-any-time-to-say-goodbye-to-anybody-ucsb-students-lament-a-senior-year-cut-short/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">celebrations and goodbyes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, many of which she was looking forward to before her fellow coworkers graduated. With social distancing and </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-19/here-are-the-new-rules-as-newsom-orders-all-californians-to-stay-at-home\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stay-at-home orders</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in place, however, those opportunities have vanished. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like I still haven’t wrapped my head around everything that just happened,” Barba-Medina said. “But I think we all have to find comfort in that it’s not just us, literally everyone around the world is going through the same thing.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nadia Lee Abushanab contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The Nexus</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">agrees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Karnsrithong and Reynolds both said in their endorsement interviews that they hope to take advantage of the lobbying process and fight for legislation that supports student needs, Karnsrithong has no personal lobbying experience and lacks his opponent’s fluency in drafting legislation and reviewing policy. This is imperative, as the duty of the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) is to represent student needs on the UC, state and federal level through means such as lobbying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Karnsrithong struggled to answer basic questions about major student issues, including those about Title IX and even what the role of the EVPSA is. He did not seem to have any concrete platform points that he wanted to accomplish if elected, nor an understanding of what exactly an executive position demands of an individual. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frankly, the Nexus does not believe Karnsrithong is a competitive candidate, particularly juxtaposed with Reynolds, who has done a lot of advocacy work outside of A.S. already. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus was impressed with the depth of Reynolds’ platform points, as her well-planned and thought-out approach makes achieving her goals more likely if elected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having worked on a number of bills with Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, the representative for Santa Barbara County in the State Senate, Reynolds’ legislative experience adds to her ability to advocate for student needs and would aid her in achieving her main goals as EVPSA: providing basic needs for all communities, providing equitable financial aid, increasing funding for mental health resources on campus, protecting survivors’ rights and lobbying for policies to diversify the UC Board of Regents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her sophomore year, Reynolds expanded her background with legislation and policy when she joined SASA as a policy analyst. There, she organized UC Santa Barbara students’ lobbying efforts against United States Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos’ proposed amendments to Title IX.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the Department of Education is currently reviewing Title IX, Reynolds believes </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“it’s extremely important that survivors, and all students who could potentially become survivors, are protected from regulations that could detrimentally change the course of their cases and their lives.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, she plans to make use of the EVPSA’s statewide advocacy platform and her lobbying experience to fight for survivors and “uphold Obama-era Title IX policies.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Karnsrithong and Reynolds both agree that Title IX is not effective in its current form, Karnsrithong’s only experience with its policies come from his training as a resident assistant, and he was unable to speak specifically to what changes in Title IX policy needed to be made.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Reynolds does not have previous experience working inside the EVPSA office, she has worked closely with the office and Lobby Corps to host SASA’s first-ever Sexual Assault Awareness Month last April. During that month, she used her legislative experience to explain bills pertaining to sexual assault to students who signed up to lobby.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds became SASA’s president and UCSB director during her junior year. In her new roles, Reynolds worked to increase awareness about sexual assault and gender bias by organzing summits and town halls — many of which were scheduled to take place in April, which is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, and have now been canceled due to the coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through her involvement with SASA, she also helped create Isla Vista’s first-ever </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-15/center-dedicated-to-helping-victims-of-sexual-violence-opens-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">survivor resource center</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in October 2019, the product of a partnership between the Isla Vista Community Services District and Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds is also experienced with the UC Office of the President (UCOP) and the UC Student Association, necessary for the role of EVPSA, who is required to meet with the UC president on behalf of the student body frequently. She currently serves as UCSB’s undergraduate representative to the Title IX Student Advisory Board. Altogether, her history of working directly with the UC Student Association and the UCOP speaks to her qualifications for the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of basic needs, Reynolds plans to lobby for legislation that would push the UC to provide better mental health services for students. She also plans to expand the role of Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) and the Campus Advocacy Resource &amp; Education Center (C.A.R.E.) through increased funding and a “more diverse staff.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds also hopes to alleviate food insecurity by working with the A.S. Food Bank and lobbying for legislation that provides support to those who are food insecure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re all fighting for these basic needs as college students. And there shouldn’t be the fact that we have to have certain communities fight harder for them,” Reynolds said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds hopes to uplift marginalized groups by facilitating direct feedback from them but maintains that she would not speak on their behalf. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think prioritizing not only marginalized communities that are very visible in the community, but also ones that may be less visible, like the undocumented students at UCSB, is important,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to maintain transparency within the EVPSA office — something that Reynolds believes the current EVPSA, Daevionne Beasley, could have done better — she plans to hold town hall-style events where students can come together and hear about the work the EVPSA office is putting out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the nature of the EVPSA office’s budget, Reynolds wants to publicize the office’s expense reports, as “students should know exactly where their student fees are going.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking at Reynolds’ work so far, it’s clear that as EVPSA, she would have the experience and drive to continue advocating for students, albeit with a much larger platform. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My passion for students’ needs and for elevating students’ voices is instrumental in this work,” she said. “I don’t think you can do this type of work without having that passion.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Had Karnsrithong waited an extra year to run for EVPSA and taken the time to hone the skills necessary for the role, he could have been a strong contender. But this year, that is not the case. For the 2020-21 EVPSA term, Reynolds’ qualifications speak for themselves, and the Nexus is certain that she’s the right candidate for the job. </span></p>\n<p><em>Update: The Nexus has replaced the portraits done of each candidate with their self-submitted headshot.

officer. </span><em>Cameron Hsieh / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the sixth lawsuit, filed in February, former officer Amanda Siegel levies accusations against current UC Police Department (UCPD) Officer Michael Little and Sergeant Gregory Smorodinsky, both of whom are named in nearly all of the other five lawsuits. Michael Little and his wife, Tiffany Little, filed their own lawsuit against the department in March 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Siegel alleges in her lawsuit that she was sexually harassed by Michael Little, Smorodinsky and an unnamed officer and was later denied a promotion after she refused to enter into a relationship with Smorodinsky. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the lawsuit, Siegel worked for the department between June 2015 and August 2019; after reporting several instances of harassment, she resigned after being told by UCPD Chief James Brock that she had become a “target” within the department. Brock took over the department as the interim chief in May 2019 after former UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson, who is named in the other lawsuits, left the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The five other lawsuits </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-03/breaking-ucpd-officers-sue-ucpd-members-for-alleged-mistreatment-after-reporting-sergeant/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Little and Tiffany Little v.

Nearly all of the lawsuits allege violations of the California Whistleblower Protection Act, unsafe work practices and a “harassing” environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The attorney representing the Littles, Signa, Reyes and Stern did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding the status of the internal mediations. </span></p>\n<p><b>Allegations Against Little: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the lawsuit, after Siegel completed field training in spring 2016, Michael Little allegedly “grabbed Siegel’s lower back/buttocks area, pulled her close and tried to kiss her.” After she pulled away, a separate and unnamed UCPD sergeant then “pushed Plaintiff Siegel against a wall and attempted to kiss her.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In late 2017, Siegel allegedly reported to Lieutenant Rob Romero that the Littles were “causing a hostile workplace,” according to the lawsuit. She then brought up her concerns to Lieutenant David Millard, who allegedly told her that a sergeant within the department, Daniel Wilson, had stated that she “was causing issues in the department and needed to be investigated because of her gender and relationships.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the lawsuit states that after Siegel received a promotion to corporal and field training officer in October 2018, Michael Little, who “failed to get a position he applied for,” “became angry and began telling coworkers that Siegel only received her promotion because she was sleeping with a supervisor.”</span></p>\n<p>According to a statement provided by Michael Little’s lawyer, Little “categorically denies each and every allegation.”</p>\n<p><b>Allegations Against Smorodinsky: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the lawsuit, after Siegel applied for a forensic analyst position within the department in August 2018, Smorodinksy “ordered Siegel to come to his home” and “ordered her to leave her cell phone and radio in the car.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He then proceeded to tell her that she was the “top candidate for the forensic analyst position, but that he could not trust her because Siegel would not engage in the kind of personal relationship he wanted,” saying that he “wanted to get married and have babies with Siegel.” She told him that she “would not date” him, according to the lawsuit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuit states that a few days later, Smorodinsky called Siegel and told her that “she was not a good fit for the forensic analyst position.” When Siegel reportedly told him that “sometimes relationships do not work out the way we want them to and that’s just how it is,” he responded, “Well, when things don’t go the way you want them to at work, I’ll be sure to remind you that that’s just how it is.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Siegel further alleges that she faced discrimination from other officers. In one instance, while responding to a call about an intoxicated person with Wilson and Officer Saray Rubio, Rubio “refused to help” Siegel, stating, “I don’t have to do anything you tell me. You are not a real Corporal.” According to court documents, both Wilson and Rubio have “a close friendship” with Michael Little.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Siegel filed two Title IX complaints with the university during 2018 and 2019, but both were rejected, according to the lawsuit. She also reportedly filed sexual harassment complaints with a whistle-blower hotline, the university’s Office of the Ombuds and human resources. She “never received any resolution regarding her complaints,” according to the lawsuit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosanna Vargas, a representative from the attorney’s office representing Siegel, said in an email that Siegel “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hopes to be able to change the culture at the UCSB Police Department for future women in the police department.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ms. Siegel was a devoted police officer for the UCSB Police Department.

Six applicants will then be selected after applications close on June 1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lisa Klock, the process innovation program manager of the College of Letters &amp; Science Information Technology (I.T.) department, explained that a visit to Westmont College in Santa Barbara served as a major catalyst for the internships. In observing Westmont I.T. interns, she noted that “it [was] extraordinary what the students are capable of” as they worked alongside faculty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klock stressed that UCSB’s internships are open to anyone “who’s really wanting this” and that they’re “not just looking for the coder.” All majors, she said — including humanities and social sciences majors — who demonstrate creativity, motivation and “a desire to learn something new” are welcome to apply.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Explore, dream and discover,” Klock summarized. “Coding can be taught.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although interns will be positioned in different departments and will be working with different sets of software, Klock said that students will still meet regularly to share their progress, talk about their experiences and present their work to administrators. The objective is to foster a sense of camaraderie among all six interns and prepare them for the “real world,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chief among the program’s considerations, Klock said, is to increase student involvement on campus and to “keep these students working for the UC and inside the UC family.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We only have what is known as ‘one deep’ structures in many of our IT operations,” Matthew Hall, associate vice chancellor for I.T. and chief information officer of UCSB, said in an email. “If a person leaves, it leaves a skills and capabilities gap.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The solution is to “immerse students in I.T. culture,” Klock said. That involves having undergraduates with full administrative privileges directly creating and editing the school’s digital infrastructure, she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a win-win,” Hall said. “Employers benefit by lowering the burden of on-boarding well-qualified candidates. And the interns are equipped with practical skill in a high demand field.” Another benefit, he said, would come in the form of “a potential pool of future employees” for the UC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, the coronavirus put a wrench in the internship plans, but staff members adapted the internship training in order to keep them on pace with the original schedule.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The pandemic struck the same month we sent out the application,” Rebecca Carroll, the technical project manager at Enterprise Technology Services, said. As a result, the I.T. department was forced to adapt the program relatively quickly during its shift to working remotely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carroll explained that internship training will be conducted throughout the summer, through either Zoom meetings or all-expenses-paid online courses like LinkedIn Learning, Pluralsight and the UCSB Learning Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For interns who may not have ready access to a device of their own, Carroll said, the department will provide them with laptops, with all of the necessary software pre-installed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Come fall quarter, Klock hopes that students will be able to physically work at the offices on campus “once everything opens up again.” In the meantime, she said her priorities include clear communication and assignments for interns and making sure that “the student is happy in their needs.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The results from this year’s pilot internships will inform the next year’s, Klock said, and in the coming years, her goal is to expand the program across the entire UC system.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94276\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-03/ucsb-information-technology-will-pilot-student-internship-program-in-summer-2020/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94276\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-03/ucsb-information-technology-will-pilot-student-internship-program-in-summer-2020/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-03/ucsb-information-technology-will-pilot-student-internship-program-in-summer-2020/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-03/ucsb-information-technology-will-pilot-student-internship-program-in-summer-2020/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-03/ucsb-information-technology-will-pilot-student-internship-program-in-summer-2020/","id":1796,"author":{"id":237,"name":"Yiu-On Li"},"related":[1795,1794,1793],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
