Jersey’s major threat? That they will turn around and deal Carmelo to the Knicks, which, given the Knicks recent success, seems about as likely as Woody Allen appearing nude in Playgirl.</p>\n<p>Why make this trade? Carmelo is a big-name superstar and Mikhail Prokhrov has been dying to make a splash ever since he bought the moribund Nets franchise. The prospect of moving the Nets to Brooklyn with a marquee player to bate Knicks fans with is tempting, but is it really worth raiding the cupboard of the Nets’ young talent and future first-round picks just to bring in a player that has never proven that he’s more than just a piece of the championship puzzle? Ripping the backbone of your franchise out for King James is one thing, but — as the 2005-08 Lakers proved — having one high-volume scorer and surrounding him with dross is a recipe for a first-round exit rather than a winning formula.</p>\n<p>Carmelo is a nice player who may deserve the superstar designation, but he’s suffered a Vince Carter-like plummet in productivity this season. If he isn’t scoring 28 points per game and shooting at least 45 percent (to go along with his usual stellar rebounding), then he isn’t worth the $65 million over three years that the Nets would pay for him.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Nuggets seem like the clear winners in this trade, although they would probably benefit from flipping Devin Harris in the offseason for a wing scorer, handing the reins over to Ty Lawson and seeing if the waterbug point guard from North Carolina can’t replicate Raymond Felton’s New York rebirth in the Rocky Mountains. Denver was a championship contender a few seasons ago, running into the Lakers buzzsaw and torpedoing its chances mainly because of its comical lack of frontcourt depth. This trade would solve that issue, bringing in promising big man Derrick Favors and a raft of draft picks that, even with a lockout looming, are sure to be full of high-quality talent.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, the Nuggets can afford to wait until June 30 to flip Carmelo to whomever they prefer. The market for his services isn’t going anywhere. Since he has an early termination option rather than an expiring contract, they will hold his rights until that date and be free to trade him wherever they choose.</p>\n<p>Holding the deal on the backburner makes sense because Denver might want to see where this nucleus can take them in the playoffs. Now that the team is fully healthy, all it has to do is wait for the inevitable Andrew Bynum knee injury and they may have just enough juice to squeak past the Lakers into the championship. Beating Miami once they get there is another matter.</p>\n<p>It’s also in the best interest for the Nets to keep losing. Like, a lot. The more the Nets lose, the better the picks the Nuggets receive will be. That’s why the most likely scenario is that the Nuggets hang onto Carmelo until the last possible second before trading him outright, especially given his reluctance to sign an extension with the Nets. If it plays out that way, I envision the Nets pulling their offer and allowing Melo to sign with the Knicks on July 1. At least, I hope it plays out that way.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus Artsweek <em>Editor Michael Hafford thinks that if  ’Melo still had cornrows this never would’ve happened.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-31445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-11/artsweek-talks-basketball-melo-nets-bad-idea/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-31445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-11/artsweek-talks-basketball-melo-nets-bad-idea/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-11/artsweek-talks-basketball-melo-nets-bad-idea/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-11/artsweek-talks-basketball-melo-nets-bad-idea/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-11/artsweek-talks-basketball-melo-nets-bad-idea/","id":2155,"author":{"id":94,"name":"Artsweek Editor"},"related":[2154,2153,2152],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":94,"name":"Artsweek Editor","biography":"Not available","articles":[901,914,2145,2155,5849,6019,6661,6794,6801,6814,6834,6838,6857,6866,6879,6885,6906,6907,6911,6924,6929,6938,6942,6968,6969,6973,6987,7755,7758],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"I.V.

The center will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>\n<p>The center will provide a place in I.V. where survivors can receive medical attention, make a police report and obtain an emergency protective order. Previously, survivors would only have access to these services at STESA’s location in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Survivors will also be able to obtain emergency services such as food, shelter and transportation. The center will also have the resources to help survivors apply for U Visas and T Visas, Montalvo said.</p>\n<p>U visas are non-immigrant visas designed to aid victims of crime who have suffered physical or mental abuse in the U.S. and are assisting the investigation of the crime. T visas provide the same service to those who have suffered from human trafficking.</p>\n<p>The idea for a Survivor Resource Center in I.V. began with <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\">Ro’Shawndra Earvin’s 2017 Demands</a>, a list of 12 demands presented to Chancellor Yang after a 13 hour sit-in.</p>\n<p>Earvin, a former student at UCSB and advocate for sexual assault reforms, along with a large group of students, presented a list of 12 demands calling for sexual assault reform. The No. 1 demand on the list called for the creation of a survivor resource center.</p>\n<p>STESA, along with SASA and the I.V. CSD board members, have been collaborating over the past year in order to make the center a reality.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, board president of the I.V. CSD, said work on the project first began in Spring 2018 when he was approached by Montalvo and Madeline Loudon, I.V. Community Coordinator for SASA. They presented to Brandt the lack of services for survivors of sexual assault provided by UCSB and said that the resource center would be a quick solution to the problem.</p>\n<p>“We want to be a voice for survivors when there are injustices in the system,” Brandt said. “So this, in particular, is an example of a supporting service.”</p>\n<p>Funding for the center primarily comes from the Measure R tax that was passed last year, granting the CSD a source of revenue for their projects.</p>\n<p>The survivor resource center will be located in a central location in I.V. and will be easily accessible for residents of the community, Montalvo said. To access the center, a survivor would need to call STESA’s hotline at (805) 564-3696, where they will be directed by an advocate to the center for aid.</p>\n<p>“During our budgeting process this year, it was a big priority for the budget committee to make a line item specifically for renovating this space so that it could become the survivor resource center,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Montalvo and Brandt both mentioned how rewarding it was to work with the various groups dedicated to resolving the issue of sexual assault in I.V. and UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, this project was one of the smoothest that I’ve ever seen, especially when it comes to projects where I’ve worked with student groups on it, and that is really a testament to SASA and everything they’ve done. The same would go for STESA,” said Brandt.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 17, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Arturo Martinez is a reporter at the </i>Daily Nexus <i>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Currently enjoying his senior year at UCSB while playing for the #4 men’s volleyball team , Slaughter has accomplished a lot with that competitiveness.</p>\n<p>Growing up in Newport Beach, Calif., Slaughter was the tall athletic kid who played every sport. Basketball was his passion, but his life would take a turn after a brotherly prank.</p>\n<p>“My older brother was the only reason I got into volleyball,” Slaughter said. “The high school coach asked my 6’8’’ brother to play, but he didn’t want to do it alone. So he signed me up. I didn’t know anything about volleyball. I thought it was a girls’ sport. But I figured a skinny white kid can only go so far in basketball.”</p>\n<p>In his junior year, Slaughter led Corona del Mar High School to a CIF State Championship. At that point, his family realized he might have a future in volleyball.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t know how to get recruited,” Slaughter said. “My dad videotaped all my games, and we sent a video to every school we could think of. UCSB showed interest, but I had never been to Santa Barbara. My parents thought I.V. was a dump when we visited, but I loved it.”</p>\n<p>After redshirting his freshman year in 2007, Slaughter began to see regular playing time alongside outside hitters Cullen Irons and Jeff Menzel. The three players developed together, and now the trio of seniors leads a fourth-ranked UCSB team looking for its first Mountain Pacific Sports Federation playoff appearance since 2006.</p>\n<p>“This year is our chance to win a championship,” Slaughter said. “We’ve never made the playoffs, but almost all our starters are seniors now. We got a couple head cases, but when they’re on, they’re scary good.”</p>\n<p>UCSB volleyball has never had a better opportunity to win a NCAA Championship than with this year’s squad. Stacked with seniors, the Gauchos have strong team chemistry and a ton of talent. At middle blocker, Scott Slaughter has recorded the team’s second-most blocks with 41 and the third-most kills with 87. He also ranks second in the MPSF with a season hitting percentage of .489.</p>\n<p>But the season will end, and Slaughter will graduate at the end of the year. So what comes next for a collegiate volleyball player?</p>\n<p>“I never got to go abroad during college so I want to play overseas next year,” Slaughter said. “Volleyball is an actual sport in Europe. Some of the Russian leagues are legit. But I want to go somewhere I’d like to live. I want to play on an average team and just blend in.”</p>\n<p>For now, Slaughter’s sights are set on bringing a volleyball championship to UCSB. First, the Gauchos host #2 BYU in a two-game series this week with matches held in the Thunderdome rather than the usual Rob Gym tonight and Friday night. First serve of tonight’s match is set for 7:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33521\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-17/senior-hopes-bring-home-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33521\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-17/senior-hopes-bring-home-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-17/senior-hopes-bring-home-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-17/senior-hopes-bring-home-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-17/senior-hopes-bring-home-championship/","id":2153,"author":{"id":296,"name":"Kirk Reed"},"related":[2152,2151,2150],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The 13th Weekly Photo of the Week","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Singles tennis moves at a completely different pace from other sports.

There’s only one player to focus on and only split-second chances to capture the action. I found the returns more interesting to shoot than the serves, as they often happen much faster and involve more risks, so that’s what I focused on. In this shot, my struggle to catch each element together — the ball, the player’s movements and the emotion on her face — finally paid off. I cranked up my shutter speed, braved the harsh afternoon shadows, and was left with this as the final product.</p>\n<p><em>-Cedar Lay, Photographer</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33424\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/13th-weekly-photo-week/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33424\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/13th-weekly-photo-week/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/13th-weekly-photo-week/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/13th-weekly-photo-week/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/13th-weekly-photo-week/","id":2154,"author":{"id":325,"name":"Cedar Lay"},"related":[2153,2152,2151],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
