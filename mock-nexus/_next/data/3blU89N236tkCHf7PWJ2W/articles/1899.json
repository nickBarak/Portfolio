It was signed by 20 student sponsors.</span> <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill, which will be read by the Senate during next week’s meeting, requires a two-thirds vote by UC Santa Barbara students during the Spring 2020 election to take effect during the 2020-21 school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill was authored by Off-Campus Senator Tyler Ferguson and seconded by On-Campus Senator Emma Swanson. It was signed by 20 student sponsors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An international student, as </span><a href=\"http://admissions.sa.ucsb.edu/apply/international\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">defined by UC Santa Barbara</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “is a student who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because there is no International Student Senator, struggles specific to international students are not actively being addressed in the ASUCSB Senate to the best of the Senate’s ability,” the bill reads, citing UCSB’s 12% international student population. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To accommodate the addition of a new Senate position, the bill suggests that the current number of off-campus senators be reduced from 12 to 11 to keep the overall number of senators at 25 — an odd number that ensures “the Internal Vice President does not receive much more power in becoming a tie-breaking vote.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution noted that a similar situation has occurred in the past, when the Associated Students (A.S.) constitution was amended in Spring Quarter 2016 for the creation of a transfer student senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ferguson said he decided to propose the bill following months of conversations with members of the International Student Advisory Board (ISAB) and the Global Gaucho Commission (GGC), who both expressed a “heavy interest” in the creation of an international student senator position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the bill, the position of an international student senator “or equivalent” already exists at universities such as UC San Diego and UC Los Angeles. At UCSB, the new role would include tasks to address the “unique barriers” international students face, such as language, culture and institutional barriers, according to Ferguson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The international student senator is “expected to represent and work on behalf of the constituency they represent,” Ferguson said. He added that he anticipates that the senator will most likely work with the ISAB, GGC and Office of International Students and Scholars.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the cancellation of this week’s A.S. Senate meeting, the bill will come before Senate at next week’s Jan. 22 meeting. </span></p>\n<p><em>This article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

He also used to hold records for triples in a season (8, 1985), most runs scored in a season (74, 1985), and most at-bats in a single season (243, 1985).</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After previously being drafted four consecutive times by four different organizations, Geivett finally signed with then Anaheim Angels organization in 1985 after being drafted in the 13th round.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Geivett, his baseball-playing career would come to a sudden conclusion due to a knee injury in 1988, but this career ending injury still would not stop Geivett from being a part of baseball. Soon after, Geivett would coach for Loyola Marymount University in 1989 and Long Beach State University in 1990.</p>\n<p>While coaching for college programs added to his already impressive baseball resume, Geivett’s future would still lie in professional baseball with him eventually becoming a scout and instructor in the Yankees organization in 1991.</p>\n<p>From 1994 to 1996, Geivett would be hired as the head farm director for the Montreal Expos. The Expos’ farm system was largely known as one of the best farm systems in baseball during this time due to the tremendous talent in the system that housed big names such as Mark Grudzielanek, Orlando Cabrera, Jose Vidro, Cliff Floyd and Vladimir Guerrero.</p>\n<p>During his time as a farm director, in his book, Geivett recalls an experience he had with a particular player, F.P. Santangelo.</p>\n<p>Jeff Blair from the <em>Montreal Gazette</em> published an article with an inside major league source from the Expos’ organization, stating, “We don’t feel there is anyone in Ottawa [Montreal’s Triple-A affiliate] who can help our team in Montreal.”</p>\n<p>This angered many Ottawa Lynx players, but no more so than it angered Santangelo. After a team meeting, most players had cooled down — but not Santangelo. Santangelo would confront Geivett and insist he is ready to be called up to the big leagues, even though Santangelo was hitting a less than impressive .243 at the time.</p>\n<p>After a roster spot opened up on the big league squad due to an injury, Geivett would take a risk on Santangelo, sending him to the big leagues after Santangelo waited seven years in the minors. Stating he went above several people’s heads in the organization to do this in his memoir, Geivett’s career was on the line with this decision.</p>\n<p>Nervous, Geivett’s worst fear would come true and Santangelo’s name would be penciled in the lineup the first day he arrived in Montreal. Putting all his money on Santangelo, a person who was more confident in his ability than anyone, Geivett would come out on top.</p>\n<p>Santangelo would go on to hit a triple that night and would end up staying in the big leagues for seven years. Geivett stated in his book himself, “It was one of my most emotional experiences in professional baseball watching F.P. slide into third base … F.P. Santangelo taught me the power of confidence.”</p>\n<p>After his time in Montreal, Geivett would become the assistant general manager of the Devil Rays in 1997 and would move on to join the Dodgers in 1998 under the same position.</p>\n<p>While with the Dodgers, Geivett shared another story about college graduates looking for work in professional baseball. At the Baseball Winter Meetings, an event where baseball GMs meet and discuss potential trades, a couple college graduates approached Geivett and Tommy Lasorda with their resumes trying to get hired on the spot for jobs within the organization. Right then and there, both Geivett and Lasorda broke down the flaws in each approach the men had … to their faces.</p>\n<p>When asked about this story when speaking as a special guest for a sports management course here at UCSB, Geivett assured the class to do these three specific things that are reinforced and expanded upon in his book: “Have a specialty. Really know what you’re talking about. Make people aware what you want to do.”</p>\n<p>In 2000, Geivett would land and stick with the Colorado Rockies organization for 14 years, moving from director of player personnel to director of minor league operations to assistant general manager to the team’s director of major-league operations in 2012. After a long career in baseball, Geivett would later resign from this position in 2014.</p>\n<p>Geivett hopes the release of his book will both help and inspire generations of sports managers and people alike, stating, “I’m hopeful that in years to come somebody that reads the book remembers, ‘Hey I remember reading the book and that guy talked about that,’ and the lesson has been passed on.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76006\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-26/professional-baseball-lifer-and-former-gaucho-bill-geivett-opens-up/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76006\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-26/professional-baseball-lifer-and-former-gaucho-bill-geivett-opens-up/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-26/professional-baseball-lifer-and-former-gaucho-bill-geivett-opens-up/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-26/professional-baseball-lifer-and-former-gaucho-bill-geivett-opens-up/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-26/professional-baseball-lifer-and-former-gaucho-bill-geivett-opens-up/","id":1898,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

The two admininstrators have primarily been the ones communicating with students regarding incidents of sexual violence in the community.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the eight demands released on Monday includes formally requesting a statement of acknowledgement “from Sigma Pi and other fraternities involved in recent sexual violence and misconduct apologizing to survivors, acknowledging the perpetuation of rape culture, and denouncing the actions of removed members.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In October, the Nexus </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/sigma-pi-removes-fraternity-member-following-sexual-assault-allegations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that a Sigma Pi member had been removed from the fraternity after the fraternity president learned of sexual assault allegations against the member involving two separate women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus spoke with one of the women, who said she reported the sexual assault to Sigma Pi’s president after she learned that the same fraternity member had allegedly sexually assaulted another woman later the same night, Oct. 3. The woman said at the time that she did not file a report with the university or local police. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later in October, another person reported to the university that they had been raped in a bedroom at the Sigma Pi house. On Oct. 28, UCSB sent out a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/rape-reported-at-sigma-pi-house-third-sexual-assault-allegation-in-past-month/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">timely warning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding the report, but the warning did not clarify if the suspect in the case was a member of fraternity or not. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB chapter of Sigma Pi has yet to publicly comment on the allegations of sexual assault made against former or current members or reports of sexual assault that have occurred on fraternity property. The national office of Sigma Pi said in October that they had </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-30/sigma-pi-operations-suspended-by-national-executive-office-while-ucsb-investigates-sexual-assault-allegations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">suspended operations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the UCSB chapter while the university and local law enforcement investigated the allegations, but they did not respond to follow up questions at the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Nexus reached out on Monday regarding the status of the chapter’s suspension, the national office did not respond. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In regards to keeping fraternities accountable, Intersectional Feminists is demanding that, moving forward, fraternity leaders be designated as mandatory reporters “of suspected sexual misconduct under Title IX.” Mandatory reporters, otherwise known as “</span><a href=\"https://oeosh.ucsb.edu/titleix/sexual.harassment.and.sexual.violence/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">responsible employees</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” are “required to notify the Title IX office if a student brings information about, or an employee becomes aware of, a possible incident of sexual violence or sexual harassment.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group also demands that any fraternity accused of sexual misconduct be suspended while it is investigated, and that communication with the student body regarding reports of sexual misconduct at a fraternity or a fraternity’s suspension must be “immediate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two other demands on the list address the university’s communication after incidents of sexual violence. The university </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/speculation-and-scrutiny-community-reacts-to-timely-warning/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was criticized</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the fall for its slow response to the October reports, after which university officials held a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-administration-addresses-students-concerns-following-fraternity-sexual-assault-allegations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">town hall</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> meeting to address students’ concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One demand would require the university to also keep UCSB staff and faculty in the loop through emails from the university regarding the actions it is taking to address sexual violence. Youssef said that one of the responses the survey had received was from a staff member who was receiving timely warnings regarding incidents of sexual violence, but didn’t receive any follow-up communication from the university that students were receiving, such as </span><a href=\"https://t.e2ma.net/webview/c5to3e/6d9fb6f180a39341b8837e9b18119fec\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this email</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from Klawunn and Armistead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another demand calls for a “transparent” Clery Student Right To Know daily log and for a University of California Police Department (UCPD) crime map. While the UCPD currently maintains a daily log of “crimes that have been reported to the University of California Police Department” and a map, Youssef said the organization would like to see more consistently updated versions of both. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organization is also demanding that </span><a href=\"http://campusclimate.ucop.edu/overview/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">campus climate surveys</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which survey “faculty and other academic appointees, students, staff, trainees, and post-doctoral scholars about their experiences and perceptions of campus or workplace climate,” be conducted on a more consistent basis and include questions regarding sexual violence that occurred on- or off-campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC conducted its first system-wide campus climate study between fall 2012 and spring 2013; UCSB was found to have the highest reported rate of “‘unwanted sexual contact’ while at UCSB within the last five years,” the Santa Barbara Independent </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2014/04/01/ucsb-students-happy-but-sexual-misconduct-concerns-exist/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to more frequent surveys, Intersectional Feminists wants “relevant student entities or groups” to be able to “review, edit and contribute to the drafting process” of the surveys. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once conducted, the results must be widely shared and publicized to the student body, the organization said. Jonathan Abboud, the Associated Students President in 2014, criticized the university for not widely publicizing the survey results in an </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-04-03/survey-reveals-campus-comfort-level/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interview</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with the Nexus after they were first released. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several of the demands are also centered around safety and assisting survivors; the organization is demanding that the Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) office has its funding increased to be able to put on more workshops and to hire two “institutionalized” prevention education coordinators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current prevention education coordinator is funded by a grant that C.A.R.E. received in fall 2018, according to C.A.R.E. Director Briana Conway. Ulloa said the goal of this demand was to build upon the work the current prevention education coordinator is doing and make the position permanent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final demand on the list calls for “mandatory faculty research on perpetrators, not just survivors.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youssef said that demand also came from a UCSB staffer, who is currently conducting research on survivors of sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to kind of shift the focus to perpetrators, and why are they doing that,” Youssef said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That demand is specifically is shifting towards acknowledging rape culture,” Ulloa added. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

He called it his “home” over and over, and he made it very clear he wanted to retire a King. He wanted his jersey in the rafters.</p>\n<p>Just watch his speech at his Sacramento farewell party on Monday night: he can barely stumble through a few sentences without being overwhelmed with tears. He cried more than I did when I left Sacramento, and I was leaving to go live in a dorm with two other guys. He’s leaving to go live in New Orleans and play with Anthony Davis.</p>\n<p>The Kings finally had a star player who loved Sacramento, and they traded him away. For nothing, I should add. Really, a return of Buddy Hield, Tyreke Evans, Langston Galloway, a mid-first round pick and a second round pick for one of the greatest Kings players of all time? That’s insulting.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it’s not surprising.</p>\n<p>It would have been more surprising had the Kings’ front office managed to get a fair return for Cousins. This is a team that drafted Jimmer Fredette over Klay Thompson and Thomas Robinson over Damian Lillard. They traded Isaiah Thomas, who is currently a top-five MVP candidate, for Alex Oriakhi, who is now a Mexican club league player.</p>\n<p>The last decade of Kings management has been a master class in sheer incompetence.</p>\n<p>So yeah, sure, Cousins never made it to the playoffs and only won more than 30 games once. I consider it half a miracle he even did that, saddled with this front office. Cousins had approximately five halfway decent teammates during his Kings career —Thomas, Evans, Rudy Gay, Darren Collison and Jason Thompson — and never more than three at any one time. LeBron James would struggle to bring teams like Cousins’s to the playoffs.</p>\n<p>I can’t deny the fact that Cousins was a lot — sometimes too much — to handle as a teammate and a player. He pouted, whined and fought with referees, teammates and coaches. But when you added it all up, his offensive dominance and love for Sacramento outweighed the negatives, plentiful as they were.</p>\n<p>Cousins’s brilliance and loyalty were some of the only on-court bright spots in the last decade of Kings basketball. As long as the Kings had Cousins, Sacramento had something to hope for. He was evidence that sometimes the front office could succeed in spite of itself.</p>\n<p>That’s gone now. In the end, not even Cousins could end the torture and escape the incompetence of the Kings. No wonder my brother chose to be a Warriors fan.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 23rd, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75925\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/the-boogie-less-kings-leave-sacramento-with-no-hope-franchise-remains-in-declining-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75925\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/the-boogie-less-kings-leave-sacramento-with-no-hope-franchise-remains-in-declining-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/the-boogie-less-kings-leave-sacramento-with-no-hope-franchise-remains-in-declining-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/the-boogie-less-kings-leave-sacramento-with-no-hope-franchise-remains-in-declining-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/the-boogie-less-kings-leave-sacramento-with-no-hope-franchise-remains-in-declining-state/","id":1897,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[1896,1895,1894],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
