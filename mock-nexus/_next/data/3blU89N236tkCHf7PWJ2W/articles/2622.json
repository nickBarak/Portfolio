Kennedy established the Peace Corps in 1961, over 220,000 Americans have volunteered with the organization in 141 countries. Currently, there are 43 UCSB graduates serving in 27 countries including Paraguay, Mali and Cambodia.</p>\n<p>The top recruiter for large colleges and universities is University of Washington with 72 volunteers abroad. Among medium-sized colleges and universities George Washington University ranked first, and Gonzaga University tops the list for small colleges and universities.</p>\n<p>Tymon Manning, UCSB alumnus and Peace Corps regional recruiter for Los Angeles, said he is glad to see the positive effects of recruitment efforts at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We work with career services to set up information sessions, post positions through the job portal and attend career fairs,” Manning said. “And then I’ll do things like class talks encouraging students to come to our events.”</p>\n<p>Manning said he has seen an increase in “sustained interest” from UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really nice that we are moving ahead even as the number of applications is increasing,” Manning said about UCSB’s eighth place rank. “It makes me proud to think that students are becoming more interested in the world and not just getting jobs in America or California … We are getting more globally minded.”</p>\n<p>Tara Flint, UCSB alumna and Peace Corps returnee, said she was always interested in the Peace Corps because her father volunteered in the 1980s, and she decided to join after hearing a representative speak in an environmental careers course at UCSB.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68601\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68601\" data-attachment-id=\"68601\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/ucsb-peace-corps-rank-rises/peacecorps/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/peacecorps.jpg?fit=1440%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1440,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"peacecorps\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/peacecorps.jpg?fit=250%2C125&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/peacecorps.jpg?fit=888%2C444&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-68601\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/peacecorps-1024x512.jpg?resize=888%2C444\" alt=\"Several UCSB alumni who later became Peace Corps volunteers were encouraged to join the program by Peace Corps representatives who gave presentations on campus.

you just have to make sure that it is the right thing for you to do at that point in your life.”</p>\n<p>Associate Director of UCSB Career Services Emily White said Peace Corps is establishing relationships with many different departments and has presence at career fairs, application workshops and career panels.</p>\n<p>“Over the last two years, Career Services has been working with Ty Manning … who really understands UCSB and has been able to increase the numbers in Peace Corps volunteers,” White said. “He is promoting the Peace Corps in all different types of places, all throughout campus and its different communities.”</p>\n<p>This year, the Peace Corps will be “heavily involved” in UCSB’s LGBTQ events, according to White.</p>\n<p>“You can really see the success in building those relationships and getting the word and opportunities of the Peace Corps out there,” White said.</p>\n<p>Darlene Moreno, UCSB alumna and current Peace Corps volunteer in Armenia, said she attended Peace Corps information sessions at UCSB to learn more about the organization and even kept in touch with UCSB’s Peace Corps recruiters up until leaving for her service.</p>\n<p>“Through these sessions, I learned more about the application process and what the Peace Corps was looking for in a volunteer,” Moreno said in an email. “Because of the suggestions I received during these sessions, I became a volunteer at my old high school and at a local library near my home in Los Angeles in order to gain more experience with students before applying to the Peace Corps.”</p>\n<p>Carl Haislett, UCSB alumnus and current Peace Corps volunteer in Lesotho, said Peace Corps’s campus recruitment events taught him about the organization.</p>\n<p>“I contacted our school’s recruiter, Tyman, and met with him a few times to discuss the application process,” Haislett said in an email. “I also attended an event put on by the Santa Barbara Peace Corps Association which was a great way to meet returned volunteers and pick their brains.”</p>\n<p>Haislett said UCSB’s recent ranking does not come as a surprise.</p>\n<p>“I’m super proud,” Haislett said in an email. “Gauchos are high achievers and are doing big things everywhere.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Feb. 25 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The event was hosted by Mesa Directiva, a conglomerate of all the organizations that meet in El Centro, including El Congreso, Students for Justice in Palestine and Radio Xicana.</p>\n<p>Second-year English major Lorena Alvarez said she did not feel at home on campus until she found El Centro, and was hopeful Thursday’s open house would help students find a secure place.</p>\n<p>“For me, El Centro is a home, and I want to provide an opportunity for students to find a home like I did because I know I was lost on campus last year, and without El Centro I probably would not have stayed at UCSB,” Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>Second-year history and math double-major Minal Habash said until she discovered El Centro, it was hard to find people who understood the difficulties of minority students at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“For minorities, it’s hard to find support with a lot of the problems that we face, but El Centro is a great place to come to be able to find other people who also feel unappreciated on this campus,” Habash said. “It was the first place on campus where I really felt safe.”</p>\n<p>Habash said El Centro does not have the same amenities as other buildings. Until recently, El Centro did not have lights outside the building, nor was it labeled on the campus map.</p>\n<p>Alvarez said El Centro has also had to deal with the adverse effects of being located next to the library, which has been under construction. Now that many of the construction fences, which had obstructed students’ view of the building, are gone, Mesa Directiva wanted to host an open house to show students that the building exists.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year black studies and sociology double-major Ocil Yuleima Herrejón Rivera said El Centro has been facing obstacles ever since she was a freshman. She said many of the problems are due to the fact that El Centro is a student-run building, making it more difficult for the students to get simple necessities in the building like a hydration station, outdoor lights and computers.</p>\n<p>El Centro’s second floor is reserved for engineers, but students say engineers rarely use it because they have their own, separate building. Rivera and many students who use El Centro would like to use the second floor to increase the resources for students who need help.</p>\n<p>“In these years we’ve really tried to help El Centro grow, and part of that has been trying to have access to the second floor,” Rivera said. “It would only make sense for it to grow upward instead of to another building. Having access to the second floor would allow us to have more resources for different students of color on campus.”</p>\n<p>As El Centro strives to accomplish these goals, the students will continue to host an open house every year to grow the membership of the organizations that meet there.</p>\n<p>First-year math major Matt Uffenheimer attended the event and was glad to know the building’s purpose.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always wondered what the building was for. I had no idea it was a meeting place for so many organizations and people,” Uffenheimer said. “Even though I’m not a student of color, I’m glad I’m now aware of the importance of this building to the people who use it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

others’ experiences. <em>Photo Courtesy of RateMyProfessors.org</em></p></div>\n<p>RateMyProfessors.com allows students to anonymously evaluate professors on a five-point scale for categories like helpfulness, clarity and even their professor’s “hotness.”</p>\n<p>While UCSB students are familiar with the site, and some even rely on it to decide between classes, what do their professors think? The Nexus interviewed some highly rated instructors to see what they think about the website.</p>\n<p>Communication professor Desiree Aldeis, who scores a 4.9, said she feels the website is a helpful tool for students, provided they “take it with a grain of salt” and remember the evaluations are subjective.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a useful tool that students can utilize to make better choices and more informed choices for the classes that they sign up for,” Aldeis said. “And I think students are also aware that these are their peer’s opinions and their peer’s experiences might be different from their own.”</p>\n<p>Aldeis said that the website is also useful to professors so that they can see what aspects of their teaching style are and aren’t working for students.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important that professors get on there and read what their students say about them because there may be some things that you don’t know you’re doing that are not working well for your audience,” Aldeis said. “I feel like it’s a lot of information for us as professors in terms of how we can maybe improve or even the things we can continue to keep doing.”</p>\n<p>German professor Evelyn Reder, who also scores a 4.9, said students should avoid choosing courses based on the subjective reviews of others.</p>\n<p>“There must be some truth to it, but you also don’t know — it’s so individual and so subjective,” Reder said. “To be sure, you have to try them out, you can’t really base it on someone else’s judgment, so it’s probably not the best way of picking a class.”</p>\n<p>Reder also said the website tends to only attract students with very extreme opinions.</p>\n<p>“I kind of feel from what I’ve seen that only students that really love you or really hate you will write a review and everybody in the middle kind of doesn’t really bother,” Reder said. “I try to do my best, I try to really take my students’ voices into account and try to be there for them, but I think in every class you have students that love you and students that don’t like you so much.”</p>\n<p>Emma Levine, a graduate student studying music, is a teaching assistant with a perfect five rating on the site. She said students should be wary of personal evaluations, because students may form strong opinions about professors based on little experience.</p>\n<p>“I did find as an undergrad that it’s useful so students can report on things like here’s how many tests there are, how many quizzes or papers or how the class is run,” Levine said. “As far as kind of personal evaluations, it’s sort of hit or miss — you can get a student who just has one very strange interaction with the professor and then just hates them forever.”</p>\n<p>That said, Levine said a teacher can make or break a class.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been a TA for music appreciation class here. I’ve also taught the class, and depending on who’s teaching it, it’s a completely different class,” Levine said. “I think if you have a really great teacher, it almost doesn’t matter what they’re teaching, it’s going to be a good class.”</p>\n<p>While some student’s opinions may not be representative, Aldeis said, evaluations with a number of negative comments are often accurate.</p>\n<p>“It may be the case that one student had a very negative experience so they use that platform to vocalize it or voice their frustrations and things like that,” Aldeis said. “But … when you read multiple comments and they’re all saying the same thing, more or less, or have the same kind of theme to each one of them, then I don’t think that’s a sign of unfairness or inaccuracy. If anything I think that’s something that students should really consider.”</p>\n<p>Eric Engel, a chemistry tutor with Campus Learning Assistance Services (C.L.A.S.), has a 4.9 rating and criticized the website’s “easiness” rating.</p>\n<p>“With teachers being rated on easiness, I think that’s kind of a reflection of students not taking classes seriously or not really knowing that being forced to work is going to help them,” Engel said. “Maybe they’re seeing classes as a hurdle or obstacle to take to get to their degree and not really appreciating the benefit of hard work.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Britteny Young said she may look for a high “easiness” rating when choosing general education or prerequisite classes but would not do the same for classes within her major.</p>\n<p>“I’m a psych major, so math isn’t really my thing, so if I can find a teacher that’s reported to be easy then, yeah,” Young said. “But for my major requirements, I don’t think that’s a positive cause I’m paying for it, so might as well get the best.”</p>\n<p>Young said that overall she feels like RateMyProfessor.com evaluations are generally accurate and are useful for both students and professors.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a great idea,” Young said. “Obviously there’s extreme responses from people — either you loved it or you hated it — but I think overall you get a really good feel for the class. I think it’s good for teachers to look at it — sometimes they can be in their own worlds.”</p>\n<p>Rubí Rodríguez, a fourth-year political science major, said she would never use the website because she wants to form her own opinions.</p>\n<p>“If it works, it works, but I’ve never used it or thought about using it just because I don’t like to have or be stopped from taking a class or professor because the ratings are wrong,” Rodríguez said. “That way, I can choose for myself and not come out with an idea that doesn’t necessarily apply to me.”</p>\n<p>Rodríguez said that choosing a professor based on easiness also sometimes makes sense, because students have to consider how their choices will affect their GPA.</p>\n<p>“I think as a college student, what you want is to succeed,” Rodriguez said. “And I think with easiness you think ‘Ok I can excel. I can raise that GPA and fulfil this credit.’”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Thursday, February 4, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67927\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/ucsb-professors-rate-ratemyprofessor/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67927\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/ucsb-professors-rate-ratemyprofessor/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/ucsb-professors-rate-ratemyprofessor/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/ucsb-professors-rate-ratemyprofessor/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/ucsb-professors-rate-ratemyprofessor/","id":2621,"author":{"id":132,"name":"Vicky Munro"},"related":[2620,2619,2618],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Stigma Free UCSB’ Held To Promote Understanding of Mental Health Issues, On-Campus Resources","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"  UCSB’s Active Minds chapter and the A.S.

Commission on Student Well Being (COSWB) co-hosted an event titled “Stigma Free UCSB” at Storke Plaza Thursday to educate students about mental health issues and on-campus resources for students.</p>\n<p>From 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., more than 12 organizations, including I.V. Food Co-op, C.A.P.S., RHA, C.A.R.E., A.S. Food Bank, Student Health and EDAS, tabled to educate students and encourage dialogue about mental health. Attendees participated in four activities including jumping on a sheet of bubble wrap covered with stigmatizing comments called “Stomp Out Stigma” and filling a sandbox with sand representing different illnesses. Participants could also write encouraging comments on a wall called “Stigma Free Wall” and on a mirror called the “Body Positive Mirror” while listening to a live music performance by UCSB alumnus Erisy Watt.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major and Active Minds Co-President Melissa Boomer said her favorite event was the Stigma Free Sandbox.</p>\n<p>“The Stigma Free sandbox … is where we have five different colors of sand, each corresponds to a different phrase regarding stigma and mental health, like, ‘I support those with mental illness,’ or, ‘I suffer from mental illness,’ and stuff like that,” Boomer said. “They make a little plastic container filled with the colorful sands, and they decorate it with seashells so they have a little memento to take home today.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and accounting double-major and COSWB co-chair Kim Liao said COSWB got involved with the event to increase their focus on students’ mental well-being.</p>\n<p>“We realize that mental health is an issue for many students here, and there’s a stigma to talk about it, to reach out,” Liao said. “So I think it’s really great that we get to participate in this and co-sponsor this event and spread more awareness for mental health.”</p>\n<p>Liao said COSWB created a board of Polaroid photos from the event, showcasing students holding pre-made signs to be displayed in Pardall Center.</p>\n<p>“We put Polaroid pictures up of people holding a sign that says … ‘I’m not defined by my insecurities,’ or, ‘I don’t live in my body image issues,’ things like that. There’s no stigma to put it out there and to tell everybody else that you’re not alone,” Liao said. “Some people just put really nice quotes in there that brightens peoples’ days, like, ‘You’re beautiful,’ and, ‘You’re loved.’ I think it’s a really sweet thing.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66667\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"134320978\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66684\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66667\" data-attachment-id=\"66667\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/stigma-free-ucsb-held-to-promote-understanding-of-mental-health-issues-on-campus-resources/minds_-by-alex-payne-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"7.1\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447893851\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Active Minds Stigma Free\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66667\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1-250x167.jpg?resize=400%2C267\" alt=\"Alex Payne/Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minds_-by-Alex-Payne-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66667\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Alex Payne/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to second-year psychology major Marisa Jones, one in four Americans will struggle with a mental health issue within a year, and one in two will within their lifetime.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people who don’t take anxiety seriously, [they often say] ‘Oh, depression is just in your head,’ [they] treat it as something that you can just snap your fingers and fix and say ‘Just smile and your depression will go away,’” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Jones said while she was speaking to attendees about kids struggling with depression, someone began to say the phrase, “if I had a normal kid…”</p>\n<p>“That just broke my heart, because there are children out there who do have mental illnesses, and so that’s a kid starting at 10 years old being told that they’re not normal,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Jones said she hopes Stigma Free UCSB will help resolve mental health issues on campus.</p>\n<p>“We have so many thousands of people on campus, and we’re trying to make sure that we can get more stigma fighters one by one and that this is a big issue and that we need to fight the stigma,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Santa Catalina north tower Co-President and first-year undeclared major Tom Steel said RHA tabled to teach students living in residence halls about finding help on campus and to show them they are not alone.</p>\n<p>“We are [telling] them the safe spots around campus, different ways to get involved,” Steel said. “Different resources if you or if anybody you know is having any struggles.”</p>\n<p>UCSB alumnus and C.A.P.S. Mental Health Specialist Gladys Koscak said the most important takeaway for attendees is recognizing how prevalent mental health issues are in society.</p>\n<p>“It’s usually not until someone has a personal experience with someone who’s had depression or anxiety that people start to really understand what the impact of that can really be on people,” Koscak said. “People can be very high-functioning and still be struggling in silence.”</p>\n<p>UCSB alumnus and singer Erisy Watt said she enjoys performing at events where people unite to support each other.</p>\n<p>“Everybody who’s here really highlights the wonderful things about Isla Vista and our community, and I think that’s what this area in particular needs. It’s a strong community to just support each other and help each other and make it a more beautiful and happy place,” Watt said. “I’m happy to be able to provide sound, music for such a great community gathering.”</p>\n<p>Watt said she performed Jack Johnson and Paul Simon songs, but most of what she played were original compositions.</p>\n<p>Watt said one of her favorite lyrics from her original piece “Thailand Story” is “the wildness of the earth is the wildness in me.”</p>\n<p>“I really liked playing that song because I like to spread that message that there’s the wildness that we see, there’s the forest and the ocean that are these vast things in nature on the planet. We come from the same place, so it’s fun to recognize that in ourselves,” Watt said. “Sometimes we get so ‘Oh, I have a job’ and this and that, but I like to remind myself that I’m very much a part of this wild, crazy planet that we live on.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66684\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/stigma-free-ucsb-held-to-promote-understanding-of-mental-health-issues-on-campus-resources/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66684\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/stigma-free-ucsb-held-to-promote-understanding-of-mental-health-issues-on-campus-resources/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/stigma-free-ucsb-held-to-promote-understanding-of-mental-health-issues-on-campus-resources/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/stigma-free-ucsb-held-to-promote-understanding-of-mental-health-issues-on-campus-resources/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/stigma-free-ucsb-held-to-promote-understanding-of-mental-health-issues-on-campus-resources/","id":2619,"author":{"id":137,"name":"Mohan Saxena"},"related":[2618,2617,2616],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
