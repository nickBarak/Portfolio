This game will not count toward any of the teams’ regular season records; however, it serves as a great tune-up opportunity for both the Gauchos and the Golden Eagles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This game probably means very little when looking at the season as a whole and the long-term goals that the Gauchos have set for themselves; however, Head Coach Paul Stumpf and his staff are surely using this game as a chance to gauge the squad’s readiness for the regular season, and also to correct any flaws that show themselves throughout the contest.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday’s match will be the first time the UCSB women’s soccer team has seen the field since their season-ending loss to Long Beach State in last year’s conference championship game. That loss solidified their season record at a respectable 13-7-1 overall and 5-2-1 in Big West play. The Gauchos graduated 13 seniors from last year including three All-Conference contributors whose roles still need to be filled. But even with the departure of several key contributors, the Gauchos were still picked to finish second in the conference according to the Big West coaches poll that was released earlier this week. This exhibition provides a perfect opportunity to see how the players are fitting into their new roles and what the current rotations look like as we move closer to the start of the regular season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Probably the biggest storyline to keep an eye on as we head into another year of Gaucho soccer is the return of Shaelan Murison. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The senior forward is coming off of a First Team All-Conference selection last season, as well as a preseason All-Conference selection heading into this year. Murison started all 21 games for the Blue and Gold a season ago, leading the team in goals with 10, points with 24, as well as game-winning goals, of which she had five. As the best returning player on a talented team, Murison will be responsible for a lot of the offensive production this year, but she will also have to take on a larger leadership role as one of the six seniors on this Gaucho squad. In this season-opener against Cal State LA, she will likely take her first steps toward getting used to her increased role. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another player to look out for in this exhibition is senior midfielder Lynsee Voss, whose three goals a season ago puts her behind Murison for the second most goals scored among returning players. Voss appeared in 16 games and started in 14, and both of those numbers should increase this season along with her role within the team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior midfielder Christine Maurer, who, despite only scoring two goals last season, finished second on the team in shots and shots on goal, with 41 and 19 respectively, could be another key cog for UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With just a few adjustments and some off-season improvement we might see Maurer take a big leap this year in terms of offensive efficiency. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will also get our first look at some of the 14 freshmen that will be donning the Gaucho uniform for the first time this Friday. The competition between newcomers for playing time is sure to be fierce and this match could be a determining factor in who wins a starting spot for Santa Barbara’s season opener.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this matchup might have no actual bearing on the upcoming season, there’s bound to be many interesting smaller takeaways as we get to see the team in action for the first time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will take on Cal State LA at Jesse Owens Stadium on Friday at 6 p.m.. </span></p><div

But when IU forward Griffin Dorsey chose to try and dribble out of the box instead of clearing the ball away, a Stanford attacker stole it and shot it just over the outstretched hands of goalkeeper Trey Muse.</p>\n<p>Before they knew it, the season was over.</p>\n<p>It was a season that saw IU finish 18-1-6 and put together the fourth-longest shutout streak in NCAA history at 966:28 minutes. Just two key players left that team, and now 10 of IU’s 11 starters return in hopes of avenging that cold Sunday in Philadelphia on Dec. 10, 2017.</p>\n<p>From offense to defense this Hoosier team is filled with talent and built for success. There is no weak link on this team.</p>\n<p>Starting in the net, the sophomore goalkeeper has 30 shutouts in his two seasons at IU. Just last week, Muse made an incredible diving save to prevent Notre Dame from taking the lead 1-0 in the quarterfinals. Then there are IU’s two rocks in the backline in redshirt senior Timmy Mehl and freshman Jack Maher, who rarely let anyone sneak by them. The two outside backs are seniors Rece Buckmaster and Andrew Gutman. Both are quick and versatile in becoming offensively minded when the time is right. Gutman leads the team in goals with 11.</p>\n<p>Mix that in with the controlling midfielders that are redshirt senior Francesco Moore, senior Jeremiah Gutjahr, redshirt senior Trevor Swartz, redshirt sophomore Spencer Glass and redshirt senior Cory Thomas, who can all shift back when Buckmaster or Gutman push up, and you get a team that controls possession and allows very few chances.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the forwards — Dorsey, sophomore Justin Rennicks, senior Austin Panchot and redshirt sophomore A.J. Palazzolo. Panchot scored the game-winning goal against Notre Dame last week off a header from Gutman’s cross. Palazzolo is a big body that is dangerous on set pieces while Rennicks and Dorsey have the speed and talent to take any defender one-on-one.</p>\n<p>The makeup of this team is dangerous, and that’s why the Hoosiers are 20-2-1 this season. The last time the team lost was Oct. 3 against Kentucky, which was an uncharacteristic 3-0 defeat. In the 63 days since then, which has included 12 games, IU has only given up three goals.</p>\n<p>Also, since that loss, IU has scored 22 goals and been crowned Big Ten Champions — becoming the only team in conference history to go an undefeated 8-0 — and Big Ten Tournament Champions.</p>\n<p>Everything is coming together right now for the Hoosiers, and they are playing their best soccer.</p>\n<p>“We’re locked in as much as we’ve ever been,” Yeagley said on Tuesday before the team left for Santa Barbara, Calif. “That’s what you want: You want the team to find another gear in every phase of their game. I think we’re in that mode right now where everyone is locked in.”</p>\n<p>The redemption of this season wasn’t supposed to be beating Stanford. No, the redemption was to claim what the Hoosiers believe is rightfully theirs: the National Championship.</p>\n<p>Four teams and two games stand in IU’s way of accomplishing that goal. Akron, Michigan State, and Maryland are all deserving of spots in the College Cup, but there’s only one team who is so driven, so talented and so deserving of winning on Dec. 9, and that team hails from Bloomington, Indiana.</p>\n<p>Now more than ever, redemption is within grasp of claiming the program’s ninth National Championship.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 14\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div id=\"attachment_85316\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"472085731\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"85313\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85316\" data-attachment-id=\"85316\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/collaboration-with-the-competition-student-journalists-weigh-in-on-college-cup-teams/v46r5uqjwzed5m3gd7ybuz2ude/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?fit=1875%2C1250&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1875,1250\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-85316\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?w=1875&amp;ssl=1 1875w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-85316\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Forward Vinicius Lansade celebrates after scoring his first career goal during Maryland’s 3-2 overtime win over Penn State at Ludwig Field on Oct. 23, 2018.<em> (Richard Moglen/The Diamondback)</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>Terps Look To Finish The Season Strong With A Title</strong><br>\n<strong>Joe Catapano, <em>The Diamondback</em></strong></p>\n<p>Throw out the standings, the seedings, and the statistics. Forget that Maryland didn’t score for the first 476 minutes of the year, didn’t win until its fifth match and didn’t have a record that would even qualify for the NCAA tournament 12 games into the regular season.</p>\n<p>No. 11 seed Maryland’s campaign can be summarized using the cliché adage: “It’s not how you start. It’s how you finish.” And the Terps show no signs of ceasing their magical postseason — one that’s featured two road upsets without conceding a goal in the tournament.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Sasho Cirovski’s Terps are just as capable of winning the national championship as any of the other College Cup participants. Despite a semifinals matchup against a team they haven’t beaten both times they’ve tried this year, the Terps’ season took a dramatic turn with a loss on Oct. 12 to Indiana.</p>\n<p>Maryland is 7-1-1 since falling to the Hoosiers with 18 seconds remaining in Bloomington. The impressive record is thanks to Andrew Gutman, who Cirovski continuously boasts is the best player in college soccer.</p>\n<p>Even after two convincing 2-0 performances over former ACC foes in NC State and No. 6 Duke, it was hard to see Maryland upsetting No. 3 Kentucky in the quarterfinals. The Wildcats hadn’t trailed, lost or been shut out at home all season.</p>\n<p>Maryland scored in the 29th minute and then held on for another 61 to accomplish all three feats. So now’s the time to refer back to my opening sentence: Through all the adversity this season, the Terps’ confidence has never wavered. They’re not surprised they’re playing in Santa Barbara, and understandably so.</p>\n<p>They knew going into the season that the offense would take time to develop after losing three of their top four goalscorers from 2017. Maryland has now scored in 10 straight games and has scored on its first shot on goal in all three tournament games.</p>\n<p>They knew they would become tougher playing through what’s now the No. 1 toughest schedule in the nation. Maryland only had two ranked wins in the regular season, but they now have three since the Big Ten tournament began.</p>\n<p>They knew they had a senior class that lost in the NCAA quarterfinals as freshmen, only to see first-round exits in the next two years. Maryland has now redeemed itself, but those seniors didn’t come to College Park to reach a College Cup — they came to win one.</p>\n<p>The means of doing so starts with the backline. It’s rare for a Maryland team, but its foundation is defense. Junior defenders Donovan Pines and Johannes Bergmann are an elite center back duo, complemented by outside backs senior Chase Gasper and sophomore Ben Di Rosa.</p>\n<p>If that stout four-man unit breaks down, goalkeeper redshirt junio Dayne St. Claire will make every save he’s supposed to and most ones he shouldn’t be expected to. The Terps switched to a two-center defensive midfielder formation midway through the year, which essentially adds senior Andrew Samuels and junior Eli Crognale as reinforcements to an already-impenetrable defense.</p>\n<p>Senior Amar Sejdic pushed forward as a center attacking midfielder, where he’s thrived for a team-leading seven goals this season. The three forwards up top have done enough to keep winning. Freshman William James Herve has the dribbling skills, junior Paul Bin has the speed and senior Sebastian Elney has the clutch gene.</p>\n<p>Let this serve as the final warning. Cirovski has called this season a redemption story, and with two previous heartbreaks against Indiana this year, the Hoosiers might be the penultimate victim in the Terps’ title tale.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"attachment_85315\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"863840015\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"85313\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85315\" data-attachment-id=\"85315\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/collaboration-with-the-competition-student-journalists-weigh-in-on-college-cup-teams/soccer-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg?fit=1000%2C664&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,664\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"soccer\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg?fit=888%2C590&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85315\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg?resize=888%2C590\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"590\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-85315\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Annie Barker / The State News</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>After five seasons of defeat, this is MSU’s moment</strong><br>\n<strong>Kara Keating, <em>The State News</em></strong></p>\n<p>When thinking about Michigan State athletics, the first thing that comes to mind is often the football team or the men’s basketball team. For other fans, they tend to point out the men’s soccer team, especially after they posted 14-4-4 in the regular season are beginning to be known as a powerhouse.</p>\n<p>For the first time in 50 years, the Spartans are making their appearance in the Final Four after losing players to injury, going through scoring droughts and being eliminated in the Elite Eight four times in the past five seasons. This is their chance to earn the victory they have been dreaming of. With Head Coach Damon Rensing at the helm since 2009, the team has a 2018 NCAA Tournament record of 11-5-3.</p>\n<p>The team has been named co-champions twice — once back in 1967 and again in 1968 — but this is their moment to shine and win it all as independent champions.</p>\n<p>The Spartans would defeat some of the top teams in the Big Ten Conference and in the nation, but it was merely talked about while being shadowed by the 7-5 football team and other major news surrounding the campus. Before the start of the season, MSU fans would support the soccer team and head to the free games on campus, but they never truly got the buzz that they are getting now from Spartan fans and the student section known as the Red Cedar Rowdies.</p>\n<p>After beating James Madison University last Saturday, the team is now seeing what impact they have made. While leaving a restaurant in town after a team meal, people began applauding, which is something the players have never experienced before.</p>\n<p>“That just hit home on just how much of an effect this team has had,” Rensing said.</p>\n<p>Not only do the fans in East Lansing want another National Championship for their town, but so do these players. Senior forward Ryan Sierakowski and his senior classmates made this their goal starting their freshmen year and are determined to make it there.</p>\n<p>This season Sierakowski is close to becoming the first Spartan player to lead the team in points in his four seasons in the green and white uniform, and he is ranked No. 10 all-time in scoring, putting up 82 points in 81 games.</p>\n<p>The offense isn’t the only ones hitting the back of the net, though. Three MSU defenders have scored a total of five goals together throughout the season: redshirt sophomore Patrick Nielsen, junior Michael Wetungu and senior John Freitag.</p>\n<p>Another strong advantage for this tournament is the familiar faces that they will come to play against in the tournament. To start the Final Four off, they will take on Akron for the second time this season after losing to the Zips 2-1, but they feel ready to compete after regaining players back from injuries.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have to watch film,” Rensing said. “We know Akron, and they know us … You’d rather dance with the devil you know than the one you don’t know.”</p>\n<p>Going from multiple NCAA tournament runs and constant letdowns before making it to the Final Four, this team has come together for not only the fans but also for their former teammates to earn them the title that they know they deserve.</p>\n<p>Whether they become National Champions or lose to Akron on Friday night, Michigan State will become a little more focused on what the soccer team will bring for years to come.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

College Cup at Harder Stadium. Maryland comes into the matchup with an 11-6-4 record, while Indiana sports a 20-2-1 mark for the season.</p>\n<p>The Hoosiers and the Terps are well-acquainted with one another as they have met twice already this season, with Indiana emerging victorious both times.</p>\n<p>The first meeting came in Bloomington, Ind., during Big Ten Conference play when the Hoosiers escaped with a 2-1 win, thanks to a last-minute goal by senior defenseman Andrew Gutman. The second matchup between the two teams came in the semifinals of the Big Ten Tournament, during which Indiana again edged out the Terps in penalty kicks. Both matches came down to the wire and could have gone either way, save for a few miscues and lucky bounces that ultimately went the way of Indiana.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>If the game on Friday is also a defensive battle, then it seems that the Hoosiers will have the advantage yet again. They haven’t allowed a goal so far in NCAA play and don’t show any signs of loosening their stringent backline.</p>\n<p>Indiana was just as stingy during conference play, in which they led the league in shutouts (12) and goals against (11). They haven’t lost since Oct. 3, and their effort on the defensive end is a big reason why.</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior Timmy Mehl and Gutman have been the main players commandeering defense this season, and both already have years of experience competing in the postseason.</p>\n<p>Gutman, in particular, has been the main leader of this Indiana squad. He hasn’t been just a defensive anchor; he also has been pulling his weight on the offensive end as well. The defender leads the team in goals (11) and is second in the Big Ten Conference.</p>\n<p>The Hoosiers have a loaded roster that contains four first-team All-Big Ten players as well as four second-team players. Goalie Trey Muse has only allowed 11 goals on the season, putting him en route to be named the best goalie in the Big Ten.</p>\n<p>Indiana has historically been a fixture in the College Cup. This is its second consecutive year qualifying for the Cup and its NCAA-record 20th time qualifying overall.</p>\n<p>The Hoosiers last won the championship in 2012 — the most recent victory for any of the teams in the Final Four — and have nine titles overall.</p>\n<p>Even with such an illustrious history, this year’s team is definitely unique.</p>\n<p>“This group is a special one amongst the teams we have had,” Head Coach Todd Yeagley explained. “The numbers certainly speak for themselves. They’re very focused, just a wonderful group to coach.”</p>\n<p>So far this season, Indiana emerged victorious from the Big Ten Tournament with a 3-0 victory over Michigan in the title game and thus earned an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. After receiving a first-round bye, the Hoosiers flexed their muscles against UConn in their second-round matchup, winning the game 4-0 in a match that was never in doubt.</p>\n<p>Their second game of the tournament pitted them against Air Force, and the Hoosiers again got off to an early lead with two goals scored within the first 22 minutes of action. From there the Hoosiers rode their defense and held Air Force scoreless for the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>Indiana’s quarterfinal matchup came against its interstate rival and the No. 7 team in the country, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. In their prior meeting, Indiana squeaked out a 2-1 overtime win in South Bend, and Notre Dame was looking for revenge. This game was a battle of two defenses, as neither team could put the ball in the net until the 63-minute mark when Austin Panchot gave the Hoosiers the go-ahead and ultimately the game-winning score.</p>\n<p>Maryland is led by a pair of first-team All-Big Ten players in senior midfielder and leading goal scorer Amar Sejdic and junior defenseman Donovan Pines. Although they are a familiar foe, Indiana is certainly not taking them lightly.</p>\n<p>“You can’t take one thing away from Maryland and feel like you’ve solved them,” Yeagley said. “I feel that is a strength of our team as well. There are a lot of mirroring qualities between these two teams.”</p>\n<p>These two squads have definitely earned the right to play on this stage, and if their prior meetings are any indication, we should prepare for another hard-fought battle that comes down to the wire.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

drought of this length is rare.</p>\n<p>In the three years since UCSB’s last appearance in the NCAA Tournament when they fell to Clemson in the Round of 16, each season’s Gaucho team has seen their campaign end in disappointment come conference tournament time. This year’s Gauchos became the latest to join that group.</p>\n<p>As unsuccessful as the Gauchos have been in recent times, there’s a recipe for success to make it back to the grand stage of the College Cup. It’s simple on the surface, but it wouldn’t be the crown jewel of college soccer if it didn’t require perfect execution by the four teams that make it that far.</p>\n<p><strong>Tactics: Outsmarting the Opponent</strong></p>\n<p><em>“That’s been our issue all year. What’s been that ‘something different’ that can get us a goal?”</em></p>\n<p>vom Steeg has the expertise and know-how to have the upper hand against any opponent, but as good a problem as it is to have so much talent at his disposal, it was also a nightmare to figure out what formation would get the most out of his team.</p>\n<p>Throughout, he worked with four different formations: first a 4-2-3-1, then a 3-5-2, onto a 4-4-2, and toward the end of the season shades of a 4-3-3.</p>\n<p>An argument can be made that UCSB played the best soccer of its season in any of the formations, but once the team got slightly exposed in one setup it was on to the next one.</p>\n<p>This constant tinkering hampered players who excelled in certain roles in one formation and struggled in others, and there was no regularity for the team to grow into a formation as a unit.</p>\n<p>One such example is senior defender and team captain Jan Ilskens. If he could be listed as a utility man, that would be a better descriptor since he’s been deployed as a center back, defensive midfielder, right back and even as a striker in the past two years.</p>\n<p>After starting the season as a right back in the 4-2-3-1, he moved to right center back in the 3-5-2. With the wingback spots occupied in the 4-4-2 by juniors Ignacio Tellechea and Noah Billingsley, he began to get some playing time up top to support sophomore Rodney Michael in the forward lines. Playing out of position in attack didn’t suit him, so he moved back into the defensive midfield in the 4-3-3.</p>\n<p><strong>Consistency: Establishing Your Roles</strong></p>\n<p><em>“If you follow Gaucho soccer, scoring goals this year has always been an issue for us. When we scored goals, it usually happened in bunches.”</em></p>\n<p>The 2018 Gauchos certainly did score in bunches: Five times this year they managed to score multiple goals within a five-minute span. In the game against CSUN, it was vom Steeg’s tactical switch at halftime that worked to their favor as they scored a trio of goals in just seven minutes.</p>\n<p>Yet it was hard to spread the goals around the team and even harder to score on the road.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had just five players with multiple goals on the season. Of those five, freshman forward Carter Clemmensen’s goals were both in the opening weekend of play, and sophomore forward Kaya Fabbretti didn’t join the ranks until the final game of the regular season.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s road woes were well-documented this season, but one statistic still seems unbelievable until it’s checked against the team’s results: the Gauchos failed to score in each of their six road losses.</p>\n<p>When the Gauchos scored, they got results. When they didn’t, they lost.</p>\n<p>It should be no surprise that Michael had a goal and two assists in the road win at New Mexico and draw at UC Irvine. This year’s team relied heavily on the sophomore and oftentimes struggled to find a Plan B.</p>\n<p>This was the result of an ever-shifting midfield and attack for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The backline became solidified very early on in the season, but each game saw a rotating cast providing support for Michael and Billingsley, seemingly the only two regulars in the attacking half of the starting lineup.</p>\n<p>UCSB played best when midfielders like junior Sahid Conteh and Fabbretti made deep runs and were able to contribute to the attack. When there’s so much talent and so many different styles of play vying for such few spots on the field, it can be difficult to implement one method of play over another. Injuries and suspensions didn’t help vom Steeg’s case either.</p>\n<p>Figuring out the perfect combination in both areas will be the biggest challenge for the Gaucho coaching staff heading into next season.</p>\n<p><strong>Luck: What Every Champion Needs</strong></p>\n<p><em>“Soccer is a sport that if you don’t feel like you’re going to score, then you don’t let the other team score, and then you leave it to the penalty spot and see what happens.”</em></p>\n<p>Part of the reason why UCSB hasn’t been able to make it back to the NCAA Tournament is simply down to luck.</p>\n<p>In any tournament setting, especially one with as small a sample size as three games like in the Big West Tournament, a deflection or a shot that hits the post or crossbar can be the difference between winning and losing.</p>\n<p>In this year’s quarterfinal against Fullerton, UCSB dominated possession in the second half of the game, but sophomore midfielder Carson Vom Steeg missed an open shot, and Michael failed to convert on an opportunity late in extra time.</p>\n<p>Lady (Bad) Luck struck again in the penalty shootout when junior forward Ignacio Tellechea hit the crossbar, ironically after scoring his first goal of the season earlier in the match to get them that far.</p>\n<p>Luck isn’t just a big factor in the conference tournament; the landscape in the Big West would have looked completely different if Michael hadn’t missed his penalty in the ninth minute at UC Irvine and the Gauchos didn’t have to come from behind to secure the 2-2 draw. If anything, it’s as important considering the college soccer season features so many games in such a small window.</p>\n<p>With so many players being introduced into the fold, it may have been far-fetched to think that everything would come together in just one year.</p>\n<p>Yet the hope remains. If Tim Vom Steeg gets all of this right and the Gauchos can get some luck on their side, the next trip to the College Cup might not be far off.</p>\n<p><em>Arthur Wilkie is the Sports Director at KCSB-FM and served as the station’s lead play-by-play commentator on men’s soccer for the past two seasons.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85325\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/as-showcase-comes-home-gauchos-left-wondering-what-could-have-been/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85325\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/as-showcase-comes-home-gauchos-left-wondering-what-could-have-been/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/as-showcase-comes-home-gauchos-left-wondering-what-could-have-been/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/as-showcase-comes-home-gauchos-left-wondering-what-could-have-been/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/as-showcase-comes-home-gauchos-left-wondering-what-could-have-been/","id":1333,"author":{"id":303,"name":"Arthur Wilkie"},"related":[1332,1331,1330],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
