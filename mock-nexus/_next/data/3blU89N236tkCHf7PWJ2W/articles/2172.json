Yang and Lisa Przekop, director of the Office of Admissions at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Chuck Haines, assistant chancellor of the Office of Budget and Planning at UCSB, addressed the assembly with concerns about the current state of the school’s physics program.</p>\n<p>There has not been a “permanent increase” in facility space for the physics department since 1994, according to Haines.</p>\n<p>He cited a shortage of space for students majoring in physics despite a 300 percent increase in the number of physics students since 2006.</p>\n<p>Haines proposed UCSB construct a new physics building, which would encompass 125,000 square feet of space and cost $165 million. According to the meeting agenda, a source of funding has not been verified.</p>\n<p>Across campus, the most recent classroom building was constructed in 1967, but the school has recently received preliminary project approval from the UC Regents to construct a new building, according to Haines.</p>\n<p>In addition to core funding, campus revenue will also be used to develop the building, which will hold 2,300 new classroom seats, he said.</p>\n<p>Housing has also become a primary concern for the campus as the increase in residents exceeded the school’s intended capacity by about 1,200 students, according to the meeting agenda.</p>\n<p>The university plans to make space for 5,000 more beds by 2025 as part of their Long Range Development Plan (LRDP), according to the meeting agenda.</p>\n<p>Currently, 1,500 of the 5,000 beds have already been constructed through the development of the San Joaquin and Sierra Madre living spaces, Haines said.</p>\n<p>To fulfill the remainder of the LRDP plan, Haines proposed renovating existing housing sites such as Storke Apartments and the Channel Islands residence halls “to increase density and build additional housing.”</p>\n<p>For the development of faculty housing, UCSB has taken a different route.</p>\n<p>The college plans to narrow Ocean Road, leaving more room for the development of roughly 540 residential faculty units, Haines said.</p>\n<p>Not only will this bring faculty housing closer to campus, but Haines hopes that it will also bring a faculty presence to Isla Vista, attracting different businesses to the area and bringing steady activity to businesses during the summer and holiday seasons.</p>\n<p>The school plans to carry out this project through a third-party developer, which Haines believes they will begin to look for sometime in 2019.</p>\n<p>Campus buildings — many of which are “at the end of their useful life” — are requiring more money and maintenance over time, Haines said.</p>\n<p>The effects of old equipment spill over to laboratories as well, forcing faculty members to work with old equipment that does not always support their research. This is known to stifle UCSB’s faculty recruitment process, according to Haines.</p>\n<p>Haines noted that the school has used one-time state funds to fix critical building system problems in the past, but options are running out as “the backlogs are significant and the problems are growing larger.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85196\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85196\" data-attachment-id=\"85196\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-02/assembly-budget-subcommittee-discusses-current-needs-and-future-changes/sanya-kamidi_budget-meeting_online-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1488&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1488\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Sanya Kamidi_Budget Meeting_ONLINE (2)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=888%2C661&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85196\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=888%2C661\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"661\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=250%2C186&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=768%2C571&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C762&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sanya-Kamidi_Budget-Meeting_ONLINE-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85196\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>As the discussion turned to funding, local assemblymember Monique Limón asked the panel how they plan to prepare for the next recession.</p>\n<p>Martin Shumaker, executive director of the Office of Budget and Planning at UCSB, explained that he and Haines are cautious about putting money into “permanent obligations.”</p>\n<p>Shumaker added that UCSB has been “frugal” about its staffing in an attempt to do “more with less.” UCSB’s concern with the success of its programs and which programs will receive funding in the future is an example of this practice, Shumaker said.</p>\n<p>Non-academic services, also known as auxiliaries, have been noted to provide the university with sizable additional revenue, he said.</p>\n<p>Shumaker also recommended the university “look at philanthropy and grow that side of the campus to create revenue,” as this can help fill the holes caused by previous recessions in 2008 and 2012.</p>\n<p>Limón explained that as a higher education facility, UC and CSU campuses do not receive funding from Proposition 98, which provides funding for California Community Colleges. This lack of annual funding poses further challenges in the way of sourcing revenue.</p>\n<p>Another concern regarding enrollment is attracting out-of-state and international students. Haines said he believes the price of tuition is not competitively priced, comparable to that of Ivy League universities.</p>\n<p>Out-of-state tuition practices, such as the school’s refusal to give financial aid to residents outside California, diminishes its demand from an out-of-state perspective, Haines said.</p>\n<p>Przekop added that many schools aiming to recruit California residents offer scholarships that UCSB cannot match.</p>\n<p>Concerns are different for in-state students, according to California Assemblymember Kevin McCarty, who serves as the chair of the committee. The average yearly rate for room and board at UC Santa Barbara is $15,273.</p>\n<p>But room and board, unlike tuition, is not covered with money from traditional Pell Grants or UC Blue and Gold Opportunity Plans, forcing roughly 40 percent of the student body living in residence halls to either find applicable scholarships or take out loans.</p>\n<p>These loans incur an average of $20,000 to $30,000 of debt following graduation, according to McCarty.</p>\n<p>Recently, UCSB has ramped up efforts to support its students during economic hardships and times of distress, according to the meeting agenda.</p>\n<p>For example, UCSB has developed meal, grocery store and housing voucher programs; a financial crisis response team; a food boarding program to help students cook communally; and a CalFresh campaign, which registered roughly 3,000 students and brought $5 million worth of resources to UCSB students.</p>\n<p>With many projects and policies set for implementation in the coming years, the potential effects on the campus and its community are still unknown, Jackson said.</p>\n<p>However, Chancellor Yang remains optimistic.</p>\n<p>“We must not compromise the qualities of education and diversity,” Yang said during the meeting.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

UCSB’s chapter is led by Conway, who has been working with the program since 2014.</p>\n<p>The meetings took place at UC Davis and spanned from Dec. 10 to Dec. 12. Those in attendance also included UC Interim Systemwide Title IX Coordinator Suzanne Taylor and Vice President for Student Affairs Robin Holmes Sullivan.</p>\n<p>The directors typically hold biannual meetings to discuss a multitude of issues related to sexual assault and violence, Conway said. At last week’s meeting, their primary concern was the Department of Education’s recent proposed Title IX changes.</p>\n<p>Among various modifications, the changes propose narrowing the definition of sexual assault under Title IX and allowing for the cross-examination of accusers and respondents in live courtroom hearings.</p>\n<p>The C.A.R.E. directors discussed how these changes would disrupt the UC’s current “single-investigator model” by allowing for the cross-examination of accusers and respondents in live hearings.</p>\n<p>Currently, the UC’s model uses a “neutral-fact finding” investigator to determine whether there is enough evidence to constitute a violation of Title IX policy. The amendments would change this by shifting disputes to traditional courtroom settings, opening the possibility of power imbalances, according to Conway.</p>\n<p>“It’s becoming much more of a legalized process that can feel really intimidating to someone in trauma. Obviously some parties choose to have lawyers involved, so there’s an imbalance in power there if one party has a lawyer and the other doesn’t,” she said.</p>\n<p>Other concerns related to this amendment includes the financial ability of students to pay for legal services often needed to pursue a case in court, Conway said.</p>\n<p>Conway feels that shifting to the courtroom model would create unnecessarily difficult hurdles for survivors as well as alleged perpetrators.</p>\n<p>“Having to put a survivor in the same room as their perpetrator is barbaric, but that’s not to say that the student who is defending their academic future isn’t also in a stressful situation,” Conway said.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“I think the burden would fall on either the UC or our campus to integrate how what happens in Isla Vista is tied to the educational experience of the students.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, the C.A.R.E. directors considered how schools would no longer be required to investigate off-campus allegations, which could leave a large number of incidents in neighboring communities ignored, according to Conway.</p>\n<p>She feels that especially with UCSB and Isla Vista, survivors’ experiences would be severely neglected.</p>\n<p>Conway hopes that whatever transpires with the proposed changes, UC administrators will be able to maintain protections of their students under the law. However, she said it might be up to the UC system to decide how to proceed with pursuing off-campus cases in the future.</p>\n<p>“I think the burden would fall on either the UC or our campus to integrate how what happens in Isla Vista is tied to the educational experience of the students.”</p>\n<p>C.A.R.E. directors also discussed controversies over the amount of evidence required for Title IX convictions.</p>\n<p>Currently, the “preponderance of evidence” standard requires that institutions follow the lowest standard of evidence when deciding if students have violated Title IX. This standard was set forth by the Obama administration, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/us/devos-colleges-sex-assault.html\">New York Times.</a></p>\n<p>With the changes, the Department of Education would instead let schools decide which standard to follow, whether it be “preponderance of the evidence” or a higher standard of “clear and convincing evidence,” as the <a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/title-ix-nprm.pdf\">department’s report</a> stated.</p>\n<p>According to the report, some cases carry “particularly grave consequences for a respondent’s reputation and ability to pursue a professional career,” which might warrant a higher standard of proof.</p>\n<p>Whether it be “preponderance of evidence” or “clear and convincing evidence,” institutions would be required to use the same standard for students and faculty members, the report said.</p>\n<p>Conway agrees that regardless of the accepted standard, it is most important for institutions use the same guidelines for employees and students alike.</p>\n<p>“When we treat populations with different standards of evidence … it almost creates a system of power and privilege,” Conway said.</p>\n<p>In light of the proposed amendments, C.A.R.E. directors also talked about how schools can provide resources.</p>\n<p>“If the federal government is going to start narrowing down the help that we can provide survivors in the administrative process, we as an institution need to respond to broader, better arms to help care for the human being,” she said.</p>\n<p>This includes ensuring that “responsible employees” respond adequately to reports of sexual assault and are trained to provide resources for students and connect them to programs like C.A.R.E. It also includes communicating students’ rights to survivors and helping them through processes like law enforcement and civil reporting.</p>\n<p>Taylor and UC President Janet Napolitano, who recently wrote a <a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-troubled-proposed-changes-sexual-harassment-rules\">press release</a> and an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/janet-napolitano-dont-let-the-trump-administration-undermine-title-ix/2018/12/04/6c91f316-f7fc-11e8-863c-9e2f864d47e7_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.14e3cbe04ab6\">op-ed</a> about this issue respectively, will factor C.A.R.E.’s discussion into the official UC opinion on the Title IX changes, Conway said.</p>\n<p>The Department of Education has allowed for a 60-day period of public comment following the proposed changes.

UCSB employees. <em>Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution to do so, written by Off-Campus Senators Dallin Mello and Christian Ornelas, calls upon the University of California to implement a cost-of-living adjustment and increase the current minimum wage. It also directs UC Santa Barbara’s Associated Students (A.S.) to raise its workers’ pay to $15 an hour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are 322 students employed by A.S., and 33 career employees, according to Ornelas. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mello and Ornelas noted in the resolution that the UC had implemented a policy in 2013 that raised the minimum wage for UC employees to $15 in 2013, but that it only applied to those who worked at least 20 hours a week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“…at many UC campuses, students are prohibited from working more than 19 hours per week, thereby systematically preventing them from qualifying for a raise under this policy,” the resolution states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution demands that the $15 minimum wage be applied to all UC workers, regardless of the number of hours that they work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with supporting a systemwide cost-of-living raise, the resolution also directs A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez to work with Student Advocate General Grecia Martinez and President Brooke Kopel to increase wages for students employed by A.S. UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution mandates that yearly A.S. budgets from now onward should account for the increased wages and directs the UC Human Resources department to “perform an upward reclassification” of UCSB employees to ensure that their minimum salary meets the living minimum wage policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Human Resources department declines to do so or does not respond to the resolution within two weeks, the Senate will provide honoraria for A.S. UCSB employees to ensure their final pay amounts to at least $15 an hour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate also plans to pass a resolution stating that “ASUCSB has no confidence with University of California’s ability to fairly treat ASUCSB employees” if Human Resources does not accommodate the requests.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators discussed where the funding would come from during Wednesday evening’s meeting, clarifying that student fees would not be raised in order to increase A.S. UCSB wages. Instead, funds within the current budget would be reallocated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though several senators argued that it would be unfair to prioritize A.S. UCSB workers with this raise when many students have other on-campus jobs or work in I.V., Ornelas referred to this motion as a “stepping stone” with the hope of setting the tone for other organizations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Instead of waiting for [the university] to do something… we should start and let them follow us with everything that we do,” On-Campus Senator Zion Solomon added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon was the only one to abstain from the vote, stating they strongly supported the resolution but could not vote due to a conflict of interest because they worked at the A.S. Ticket Office.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Ornelas clarified that there are 322 student employees working for Associated Students. The article previously said there were 282. </em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi is an asst. news editor at the </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and can be reached at </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">skamidi@dailynexus.com</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">news@dailynexus.com</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>.</em> </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
