Senate meeting. It states that UCSB should partner with Sprigeo, a third-party vendor, to offer students a 24/7 mobile application, webform, text hotline, phone hotline and email hotline to report a crime.</p>\n<p>If the Senate passes the resolution, A.S. would establish a contract with Sprigeo for the service and “widely publicize” the app to incoming students as a way to report sexual assault on campus and in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of partnering with this company is that so many resources in Associated Students are available and we pay for them, but no students know they exist or they don’t know how to access them, and that’s a huge issue,” said Senator Kristen Armellini, who co-authored the resolution with Senator Grecia Martinez.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Matan Bostick sponsored the resolution.</p>\n<p>The Sprigeo app would allow students to anonymously report offenses that would then be processed by “designated university officials and [be] appropriately and confidentially responded to in prompt fashion,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>Following a lengthy debate, the Senate sent the resolution to External Affairs to be discussed further.</p>\n<p>Before voting, some senators expressed disappointment with how the subject was approached.</p>\n<p>Senator Alexandra Gessesse said that the Senate had last spoken to Bostick two weeks before, but that the updated resolution was “slapped on” the night before the meeting.</p>\n<p>She added that the resolution should have been created in conjunction with current student efforts to combat sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“The reason why I have a problem with [the resolution] is that no one is doing anything unless it makes them look real good, or they care about it and they’re caring about it when they’re not prioritizing other issues,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>The amount of time allotted to work on the resolution was also a point of concern for some senators because of the sensitivity of the topic.</p>\n<p>“This resolution shouldn’t be worked in a week. It should be worked in one month, two months, three months,” Senator Andrea Reyes said.</p>\n<p>Another issue addressed was the use of the names of two UCSB alumni in the resolution.</p>\n<p>The alumni mentioned have previously hosted sit-ins regarding sexual assault. The first was held by Alejandra Melgoza in <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">May 2015</a> and lasted for 13 hours; the second was led by Ro’Shawndra Earvin in May 2017 and lasted for nine hours.</p>\n<p>In both instances, Chancellor Henry T. Yang agreed to the students’ <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/nowUCsb13InitialDemandsforChancellorYang.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">respective demands</a>, although Earvin has continued fighting for the completion of the demands, most recently at a Feb. 8 <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-09/sexual-assault-survivors-raise-frustrations-over-unresolved-demands/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Town Hall meeting</a>.</p>\n<p>Both Melgoza and Earvin said they were not contacted by the authors of the resolution or asked to have their names included.</p>\n<p>“Using my name without consent is perpetuating the same acts of violence,” Melgoza said during public forum.</p>\n<p>Armellini spoke about the intentions of the resolution, saying it came “prematurely” to the senate and that it “needs work”.</p>\n<p>“In no way was this resolution supposed to produce this anxiety and uproar,” she said.</p>\n<p>Currently, students can report incidents of sexual assault through the UCSB Police Department (UCPD) if the incident occurs on campus or through the Title IX &amp; Sexual Harassment Policy Compliance Office. Local law enforcement like the Isla Vista Foot Patrol can address an incident if it occurred off campus.</p>\n<p>Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) is another campus resource students can use to anonymously report sexual assault. Students can go online to file a report, which will then be forwarded to UCPD and other campus offices.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

the UC Santa Barbara campus liasions for the advisory board. The board will advise the Title IX office on how to implement Title IX policies and procedures. <em>Maura Fox / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The advisory board met for the first time on Monday in Oakland, and attendees discussed prevention education, communication and outreach on campuses and what these policies look like now on all UC campuses.</p>\n<p>Selvidge, a materials engineering graduate student was present at the meeting, but Tanaka, a fourth-year philosophy and sociology double major, was unable to attend.</p>\n<p>The board will advise the Title IX office on how to implement Title IX policies and procedures and will have “less input” on legal interpretation of the federal statute, according to Salvaty.</p>\n<p>System-wide Title IX Coordinator Kathleen Salvaty told the <em>Nexus</em> that the<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/student-advisory-board-formed-for-title-ix-issues/\"> creation of the board</a> was proposed when she took office in Feb. 2017.</p>\n<p>“I know there’s been a lot going on at the UCSB campus, but what I want to make sure is that we have some sort of healthy and open line of communication to the people who actually control the policy, if it’s a system-wide policy issue,” Salvaty said.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Hieu Le, who was on the selection committee for the formation of the board, said the board looked for applicants who were actively working on sexual assault and sexual violence issues.</p>\n<p>“We were looking for candidates who … had the experience and also had the relationships already built in to be able to interface with these groups on the campus-based level and to be able to relay what our campus concerns are to the system wide efforts,” Le said.</p>\n<p>The board was asked to connect with their campus Title IX and Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.) offices prior to the meeting. They were also told to solicit feedback from students on direct Title IX policies.</p>\n<p>According to Selvidge, she has been the head graduate student for nowUCSB, which is a sexual violence organization that’s entirely student-run and independent of the university.</p>\n<p>Selvidge said she spent a lot of time working on increasing awareness of domestic violence and dating, an issue which especially affects graduate students, many of whom are in long-term relationships.</p>\n<p>While at Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an undergraduate student, Selvidge said she was assaulted by a student and also harassed by a professor.</p>\n<p>“S.T.E.M. has a lot of sexual harassment and sexual assault that sort of gets swept under the rug, in part because it’s such a heavily male-dominated field,” she added. “I would like to see the expansion of the definitions of sexual assault and sexual harassment and especially dating violence and domestic violence because they’re currently exclusively related to force or threat of force.”</p>\n<p>Selvidge also hopes the board can talk to campus faculty and get them to understand that the concept of statute of limitations is concerning, especially when the state of California does not legally have a statute of limitations for sexual assault.</p>\n<p>As a queer-identifying individual, Selvidge believes the queer community has higher barriers in relation to assault reporting similar to the undocumented community, who may not feel safe reporting to the police, as “there’s all these nuanced issues with different communities,” she said.</p>\n<p>Selvidge is optimistic about the future of the board.</p>\n<p>“I definitely think we’ll get something out of it,” she said. “How big, how broad-reaching, how many ‘somethings,’ I don’t know yet.”</p>\n<p>Tanaka said that as an undergraduate, she hopes the Student Advisory Board will be a way for other undergraduates who have concerns about how the Title IX Office handles cases feel comfortable approaching the board with their concerns and feel heard.</p>\n<p>“My freshman year, I had a friend who confided in me about an assault, and I really didn’t know what to say. I didn’t know how to help her,” Tanaka said. “I went and talked to some people at C.A.P.S. asking, ‘What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to help her?’”</p>\n<p>Tanaka went on to do training with the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center and worked as an advocate for their crisis hotline, directly advising survivors.</p>\n<p>Last Winter Quarter, Tanaka interned with C.A.R.E. through the Violence Intervention and Prevention Program.</p>\n<p>“We set up a campaign in I.V. to help educate people who worked at alcohol-serving establishments to spread the right kind of ways to intervene in a situation that could be potentially dangerous, as far as sexual violence goes because we figured a lot of the times out here, alcohol is involved,” Tanaka said.</p>\n<p>The advisory board will be meeting again in April and will be holding a series of phone calls in between regarding specific policy issues.</p>\n<p>“I think in terms of system-wide policy issues, students at UCSB should use their student advisory board representatives as a way to communicate those concerns,” Salvaty said. “If it’s a campus-specific issue, I hope they bring those up, too because I think it might be more helpful to raise issues at a system-wide level and see if we can solve it as a system.”</p>\n<p><em>A version

the phone. “It was just hectic with a lot of wind and a lot of sun. We had to ride almost 100 miles, and I ended up getting a flat tire, but we made it to the fire station, which was our goal.”</p>\n<p>Connell and Lee have been on the road biking since Oct. 20, 2017. After graduating from UCSB in the spring of 2017, the two saved up money from summer jobs and decided to embark on a trip from Isla Vista to Colombia, opting for a different mode of transportation than the average traveler.</p>\n<p>“I thought, ‘What better way than to bike there?’” Connell said. “And then I thought, ‘What friend do I have that’s crazy enough to take on an adventure like that as well?’ So I gave Quincy a call.”</p>\n<p>Lee considered the offer for about 10 seconds before saying, “Yup, I’m down.”</p>\n<p>They started biking from the 6800 block of Del Playa Drive, where Connell and Lee were met by friends who biked with them until they reached the edge of campus. They then rode through I.V. and onto campus, past the library and under Henley Gate.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_81116\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"636970733\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81085\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81116\" data-attachment-id=\"81116\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/img_7054-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_7054\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81116\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=1832%2C1374&amp;ssl=1 1832w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=1376%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-81116\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Connell and Lee began their journey in Isla Vista, biking through town and campus before riding under Henley Gate. They made it to Malibu on their first day of biking. <em>Courtesy of Daniel Connell</em></p></div>\n<p>“Our first day, we rode out of I.V. through Santa Barbara. We ended up in Malibu that day, and up until that point, that was the longest bike ride of my life,” Lee said, adding that since then, he’s easily doubled the time he spends on his bike.</p>\n<p>“It was pretty significant because the last four years of our life were at UCSB,” Connell reflected. “That was our home, and it was a significant change to actually leave from that home to start this new segment of our lives.”</p>\n<p>After reaching the U.S. border, they spent 80 days exploring Mexico until they reached Belize. From there, they traveled through Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Monday night’s rest in Nicaragua was another stop on their journey as they prepare to bike through Costa Rica and Panama until reaching Colombia.</p>\n<p>But the two will remind you that it’s not really about the destination anymore, after having interacted with folks in numerous cities on their journey. They say they have experienced generosity, hospitality and love as they have been welcomed into the homes of strangers.</p>\n<p>“I think when we arrive in Colombia, we’re going to have a list of about 250 people we’ll need to call, like ‘We made it!’” Lee laughed. “Not even people from back home, but people we met along the way.”</p>\n<p>Connell says after 100 days on the road, they have not yet paid for a place to sleep, instead relying on the kindness of locals ― including families, firemen and policemen ― who welcome them into their homes and workspaces. Other nights, they have camped in parks, basketball courts, at bus stops or on the side of the road.</p>\n<p>They even strung a hammock between two broken semi-trucks one night.</p>\n<p>“And if it wasn’t the best rest I ever had,” Lee recalled.</p>\n<p>The bikers will admit that the most challenging part of the journey has been the biking itself; pedaling up rocky mountains for hours on end in extreme heat with bicycles that weigh about 140 pounds can take a toll.</p>\n<p>Both agreed the exercise has been as much a mental exertion as a physical one. Often, they ride on freeways with trucks whizzing past them, with a clamor of honking horns in the background.</p>\n<p>Lee once faced off with a bull in the middle of the road, remembering that its horn came within inches of his handlebars.</p>\n<p>He describes biking in these situations as a “mental game” that’s better than “any meditation [he’s] experienced ever before.”</p>\n<p>Connell said one of the best parts of the trip has been “breaking that social stigma” that people have about countries that are often portrayed in the media as dangerous.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_81110\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1796918267\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81085\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81110\" data-attachment-id=\"81110\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/img_2784/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_2784\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81110\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-81110\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The bikers stayed in Belize for two weeks after a local man invited them to stay with him and his family in their home. <em>Courtesy of Daniel Connell</em></p></div>\n<p>Connell and Lee said they planned to go to an island in Belize for one day and ended up staying for two weeks after a man invited them to stay with him and his family.</p>\n<p>“It was something special because he lived on a separate island, and his daily commute from one island to the next was via his homemade sailboat that he made purely out of materials that he found on the beach where he lives,” Connell said.</p>\n<p>They both agreed that Honduras has been their favorite country to visit so far, but only after some hesitation.</p>\n<p>“That’s a hard question!” they exclaimed in unison.

Connell and Lee’s goal of $5,000 would be enough money to donate 30 bikes to people around the world. They have currently raised $3,000.</p>\n<p>“We’re using this tool [bicycle] to change our lives… and to be able to help people use the same tool to change their lives and their community is really special,” Connell said.</p>\n<p>They are raising money through the organization’s website and their <a href=\"https://locosciclos.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">personal blog</a>, where they keep friends and family updated on their whereabouts.</p>\n<p>Connell and Lee have two more months of biking ahead of them until they reach Colombia. Despite the long journey they’ve already had, they aren’t tired — anyone could hear it through the excitement in their voices.</p>\n<p>In fact, the travel mementos they have packed keeps growing, adding more weight to their bags, although they would say it’s worth it.</p>\n<p>They currently are carrying a guitar, ukulele, multiple books, fins to help them swim, cooking supplies and even a backgammon set, Connell said.</p>\n<p>“We <em>had</em> a backgammon set,” Lee reminded his friend.</p>\n<p>“Okay, we <em>had</em> a backgammon set,” Connell conceded. “We recently lost that and it’s quite heartbreaking.”</p>\n<p>Yet it doesn’t seem to be the objects that have made this trip so worthwhile for Connell and Lee. Instead, it’s been the knowledge gained along the way, the change in their worldview and the strengthening of their own friendship.</p>\n<p>“After four years at UCSB, me and Quince, to put it in funny terms, were homies,” Connell chuckled. “We would hang out, but we never actually traveled together, and to go from that to sleeping within a foot of each other ― we’re like a married couple.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps at the end of the day, it comes down to a love of biking and a friendship that started at UCSB. One thing is for sure: Connell and Lee don’t seem to be braking anytime soon ― they are already planning their next trip, maybe biking through the Middle East, including Iraq and Iran, or from Colombia to Patagonia at “the end of the world.”</p>\n<p>They have a few rides ahead of them to figure it out.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the Feb. 15, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81085\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81085\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/","id":2323,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2322,2321,2320],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCen Project Will Be on A.S.

President Hieu Le began gathering signatures for the project during the week of Feb. 26. <em>Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The University Center Renovation Project will be on the Associated Students spring elections ballot, according to A.S. President Hieu Le, who has been petitioning to get the project on the ballot over the past three weeks.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had the fortunate opportunity to speak with thousands of students on this campus,” Le said. “Now, students will be given that opportunity to decide the future of our campus and for the future of tomorrow’s generation.”</p>\n<p>Approximately 3,500 undergraduate students signed the petition, according to Le. In order to get the project on the ballot, Le needed to collect 3,116 signatures by the March 16 deadline.</p>\n<p>“[The number] is well above the mark that we needed to be, which only shows that there is a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of support from the campus, from the student body, around this proposal,” Le said.</p>\n<p>The project, a collaboration between A.S., the Division of Student Affairs and the University Center (UCen) Governance Board, was introduced as a resolution to the A.S. Senate during a Jan. 31 <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/student-fees-may-spike-with-ucen-remodel/\">Senate meeting</a>, where it was tabled indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Senate passed a second resolution later than night, affirming support for the project. Le and volunteers began petitioning the ballot during the week of Feb. 26.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been able to hear what [students’] concerns are about their day to day issues, but at the same time we’ve been able to present this exciting and thrilling opportunity for students to consider voting for the UCen renovation expansion,” Le said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Board and career staff members involved in the elections process verified the number of signatures and student perm numbers to make sure that each is valid, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“In our process we’ve been very diligent in the educational process in ensuring that students are informed about the issue, about the benefits and also what it would cost, and what the investment would be,” he said.</p>\n<p>Le said he and others who gathered signatures were “transparent” when petitioning to students.</p>\n<p>“Our process holds the highest standards of integrity,” he said.</p>\n<p>The petition outlines a need for a 24-hour study space, an innovation laboratory, a health and wellness center, additional Campus Learning Assistance Services (CLAS) classrooms, expanded mental health peer counseling for Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.), the expansion of the A.S. Food Bank, a campus pub and infrastructure upgrades for the UCen.</p>\n<p>“When we think of facilities such as the [Student Resource Building], or the [Recreation Center], facilities financed primarily by student investment dollars, it was students 10, 20, 30 years ago who decided to make this happen for us today, for us to have access to those resources,” Le said.</p>\n<p>The project needs 50 percent + 1 “yes” votes for it to be implemented.</p>\n<p>If students vote in favor of the project, a $21.42 quarterly fee will be added to student fees until Fall 2022. Between fall 2022 and fall 2052, an additional $99.61 a quarter will be added to the fees, though that cost will progressively increase each year to match inflation.</p>\n<p>If passed, construction on the project will be completed by fall 2022. Additional fees will continue until 2052, according to the petition.</p>\n<p>Officials initially stated that the renovation would cost $48 million, but students would <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/\">pay more</a> to fund the project.</p>\n<p>“I think this is something that each student will have to weigh themselves and see whether or not this is needed for our campus,” Le said. “But I myself am very supportive, and I’m supportive of the right for student autonomy to decide for themselves whether this should proceed or not.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
