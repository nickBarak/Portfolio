I was abusing the ample array of surf porn available on Surfline when I stumbled over footage of this unbelievable surf phenomenon, known as a tidal bore.</p>\n<p>A tidal bore is caused when an incoming tide pushes waves up a river or narrow bay, counter to the direction of the current. Depending on the ensuing combination of swell, bathymetry, wind and tide, you can get surfable waves that travel up rivers, inlets and bays, although the likelihood of finding a decent tidal bore to surf is rare. I’ve personally never encountered one, but, from the looks of the delicious 8 to 10 foot caramel-colored peelers that legendary pro surfer Tom Curren and crew are pictured surfing up some remote Indo river on, that has to change.</p>\n<p>I’ve seen footage of people surfing river waves before, but “7 Ghosts” (as the new Indonesian shocker has been dubbed) takes things to a whole new level. Hailed by Curren as the product of the best surf-search in 20 years, the video shows the crew charging perfect chocolate milk waves up a remote river in Indo, each wave a mirror-image of the last.</p>\n<p>So now I finally have some material to put on my bucket list: I need to surf an epic tidal bore.</p>\n<p>Having somewhat recovered from a rotator cuff blowout that kept me out of the water last quarter, I’ve been attempting to surf every day this spring. Unfortunately, trying to keep up that charade has been an obvious exercise in denial, and has left a sour taste in my mouth.</p>\n<p>Sure, Rincon is good on a swell under 280 degrees, and Campus will light up on rare occasions, but we’ve been getting these goddamn steep norths that keep shutting the surf down to below chest-height. I haven’t surfed in several days and it feels like forever.</p>\n<p>And now, having caught a tantalizing glimpse of 7 Ghosts, I’m not sure if surfing will be the same. I finally know what I want, but it’s not going to be easy to find.</p>\n<p>If a wave’s quality could be compared to the common beverage, the typical Santa Barbara wave would taste like stale Natty’s and be as bad for you as Yoo-Hoo while 7 Ghosts looks like it’d have all the magical qualities of ambrosia — the sweet nectar of the gods.</p>\n<p>So buckle up — we’re going river nug huntin’… even if it takes me 20 years.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Daily Nexus surf columnist Elliott Rosenfeld is a total bore.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36212\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-13/surfers-leave-ocean-charge-upstream-indo/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36212\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-13/surfers-leave-ocean-charge-upstream-indo/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-13/surfers-leave-ocean-charge-upstream-indo/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-13/surfers-leave-ocean-charge-upstream-indo/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-13/surfers-leave-ocean-charge-upstream-indo/","id":2122,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[2121,2120,2119],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld","biography":"Not available","articles":[2122,2138,2149,2167,2259,2288,2298,2299,2381,2765,2788,2794,2862,2892,3000,3128,3161,3529,3534],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"S.A.G.

By withdrawing from Fall Quarter 2018, Martinez violated this section of Legal Code, Safadi said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it is unclear if Martinez will face any repercussions for the violation. In the statement, Safadi emphasized that there are no discernible consequences in Legal Code for executives who do not complete the required six units. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ambiguity of the legal code on the Ms. Martinez’s case is simply a microcosm of the larger problem at hand with the text: countless incompletions and uncertain instructions that arise only when cases pertaining to such occur,” Safadi wrote in her statement.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Nowhere in the legal code does it state what the implications for the incompletion of (6) units are and nowhere in the legal code does it discuss actions on an elected official’s honoraria in the case of such incompletion.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safadi also referenced the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-20/four-a-s-executives-over-last-5-years-were-not-enrolled-in-school-in-possible-violation-of-legal-code/\"> article</a> which found that four executives over the last five years were either not enrolled or took fewer than six units during their terms of service. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Previously, it was unclear what it meant for elected officers to “complete” six units, Safadi noted in a previous interview. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Upon communication with the Office of the Registrar at (805) 893-3592, University Policies were made evident and withdrawing from a quarter equates incomplete units and therefore it would not have been possible for Ms. Martinez to meet that (6) unit requirement expected from “Appointed and Elected officers,”” she wrote in her statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez maintained that she did not believe she violated Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In Zeina’s interpretation, in her experience serving for the last two quarters, she interpreted it as ‘that’s the requirement you need to hold the position,’” Martinez said. “As my experience as senator, that’s not how I interpreted it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t really say that there should be a consequence because I don’t really see it as black and white in terms of just me violating it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also said she believed the main point of Safadi’s statement was to draw attention to the lack of clarity in Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The issue of eligibility has come up several times during the 2018-2019 school year within A.S., most prominently with Martinez and former On-Campus Senator Yasamin Salari. Salari was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-26/judicial-council-unanimously-votes-to-remove-a-s-senator-salari/\">removed</a> from her position early last week after Judicial Council ruled that she violated the eligibility portion of the code by living off-campus.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to Salari’s situation, and to the ambiguity of Legal Code, Letters &amp; Sciences Senators Ricardo Uribe and Xochitl Briseno presented a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/a-s-senate-tables-bill-to-clarify-consequences-for-elected-officials-who-dont-meet-eligibility-requirements/\">bill</a> that would update the eligibility section of Legal Code at the Feb. 20 Senate meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill would give the Student Advocate General (S.A.G.) and the A.S. Executive Director, currently Marisela Marquez, the power to grant elected officials a one-time exception for failing to meet the eligibility requirements spelled out in Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An original version of the bill was written to only apply to senators, but an updated version sent out two hours before the Feb. 20 Senate meeting was expanded to include all elected officers, including executives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill has since been tabled twice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez serves as a student sponsor on the bill, and said that as the only non-partisan office in A.S., she felt the S.A.G. was the best equipped to decide whether or not to grant an elected officer a one-time exception. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safadi offered her office’s guidance to any senators who were interested in updating Legal Code, and urged the Judicial Council to write an advisory statement to the Senate to support its necessity. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

<em>Nexus file photo </em></p></div>\n<p>Former A.S. Attorney General Ali Suebert represented Mukai in the case against Salari, arguing that Senator Salari violated legal code by <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/on-campus-senator-yasamin-salari-admits-to-living-off-campus-in-violation-of-legal-code/\">living off-campus</a> and that she is unable “to serve and adequately represent her constituents,” according to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-06/former-cu-co-chair-files-judicial-council-petition-about-on-campus-senator-salari-living-off-campus/\">petition.</a></p>\n<p>“We feel that it is unfair that someone is able to run for a position and campaign as an on-campus senator, getting votes from on-campus students, when other people are running for the same election under the same legal code expecting to have the same laws that they were held to,” Suebert said.</p>\n<p>Former Off-Campus Senator Alexandra Gessesse, representing Salari, defended Salari on the basis that her off-campus living arrangement does not inhibit her ability to represent her on-campus constituents and that her extenuating financial circumstances prevented Salari from living on-campus.</p>\n<p>“Understanding that she doesn’t live within her constituency is real and is a serious matter,” Gessesse said. “But Senator Salari has actively and continuously… supported the constituency in which she is elected to live in.”</p>\n<p>Salari said she based her decision to live off campus on her financial aid reward and changes in her family’s ability to pay for her tuition.</p>\n<p>“I had the fullest intention of living on-campus when I found out I was elected for Senate, however this changed after my election as I received my financial aid package,” Salari said.</p>\n<p>Citing financial struggles, Salari said that she and her family “decided that taking out more loans would not be beneficial to my education and long-term academic endeavors.”</p>\n<p>As a result of this, Salari found that her only option would be to live in her sorority house, where her financial aid would cover the costs.</p>\n<p>“I had to fall back on living in my sorority house in order to make sure that my financial aid would cover all the costs for my housing,” Salari said.</p>\n<p>Mukai’s attempt to remove her from her Senate position “inherently violates the student bill of rights” in that it would “be taking a leadership position away from an elected student due to circumstances completely out of our hands,” Salari said.</p>\n<p>“Where’s the sense of decency and understanding that students face different struggles?” Salari said.</p>\n<p>Gessesse referred to past incidents in which A.S. Senate granted one-time exceptions to senators who lived out of their respective constituency.</p>\n<p>“We [should] ask ourselves what makes Senator Salari different between the one-time exceptions that have been granted in the past,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>But Suebert contends that Senate did not have the authority to grant such exceptions, which would circumvent the power of Judicial Council.</p>\n<p>“The only person who is allowed to make exceptions to Legal Code… is the attorney general or the Judicial Council,” Suebert said.</p>\n<p>Suebert said that while Senate can re-write or amend Legal Code for future situations, they cannot grant exceptions intended to bypass current Legal Code. These checks and balances of powers with A.S. are designed for fairness among senators, which she said need to be maintained.</p>\n<p>“We’re here to make sure that all students that ran in spring election during the campaign, who also may have faced financial hardship, still are held under the same legal obligations of other students who also ran,” Suebert said.</p>\n<p>The petitioning team called in Lea Toubian, a current on-campus senator, to testify about how living within her constituency affected her ability to fulfill on-campus duties.</p>\n<p>“I think it keeps me more attuned. Since I’m still living [on-campus], it’s pretty relevant to me, but it is difficult to reach all parts of the res-hall community. I think that’s why we have like four different positions,” Tubian said.</p>\n<p>“I feel like I wouldn’t have been able to reach [students living at San Rafael] if I wasn’t an on-campus senator.”</p>\n<p>Toubian also said that running as an on-campus senator as a freshman in the Spring Quarter 2018 election, like Salari, was easier for herself since she already lived in on-campus housing and was familiar with the on campus student community.</p>\n<p>Gessesse countered that although Salari lives off-campus, she is capable of serving her constituency, which can be seen through her involvement in projects such as bring rollover dining common swipes to UCSB.</p>\n<p>Gessesse additionally argued that Salari had, in fact, adhered to Legal Code by meeting with A.S. Elections Board in regards to her living situation. A.S. Elections Board subsequently dismissed the complaint, according to Gessesse.</p>\n<p>Salari’s transparency in regards to her off-campus living situation during a Senate meeting in Fall Quarter 2018 testifies to her compliance with Legal Code and fulfillment of duties as an on-campus senator. Despite living off-campus, Salari “followed all policies that were in place when she was elected,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>The responding team also brought On-Campus Senator Zion Solomon to testify about their experience as an off-campus senator. Solomon testified that the projects they worked on as a senator are determined more by her personal passions than her designated constituency.</p>\n<p>Solomon also testified that Salari’s accessibility to on-campus students was “better than my own,” citing that Salari’s office hours are held on campus and that Salari specifically focuses on on-campus issues.</p>\n<p>At the end of closing statements, Salari asked that the Judicial Council review her case in light of the work she has done for her constituency and the financial circumstances she faced.</p>\n<p>“My work should matter more. That’s what affects students more. That’s what students care about, not where I live and where I can’t afford to live,” Salari said. “My work is directly affecting students and wanting to remove will end those projects that are positively affecting them.”</p>\n<p>Salari also asked that the Judicial Council review her case as an indicator of the changes in Legal Code needed to accommodate the current student body.</p>\n<p>“This is an opportunity for the council to respond to the changing needs of student body and interpret Legal Code accordingly.”</p>\n<p><em>Sofia Mejias-Pascoe is an asst. news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus <em>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or sofiamejias@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
