As many as 28 different types of light bulbs sold at the five major retailers allegedly contain patented technology, according to the court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that from 2010 to 2019, researchers at UCSB’s Solid State Lighting and Energy Electronics Center (SSLEEC) patented a series of four innovations that allowed LED lights to mimic the orange glow of Thomas Edison’s clear incandescent light bulbs without toxic filaments and at a fraction of the cost, according to court documents obtained from Levy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The documents, all of which are duplicates save for minor changes, credit three full-time UCSB professors with inventing the patents: James “Jim” Speck, Steven DenBaars and Shuji Nakamura, who was the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All are materials professors within the College of Engineering. DenBaars is also an electrical and computer engineering professor, while Nakamura is the solid state lighting and energy center co-director. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nakamura did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding the alleged patent infringements.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joseph “Joe” Incandela, vice chancellor for research at UCSB, said in a statement to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that the unpaid royalties from the retailers in the lawsuit can be put back into “future research, education, and the development of new technologies.” Incandela is also a physics professor at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope that the action taken by UC Santa Barbara will underline the importance of respecting the rights of university patent owners,” Incandela said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Court complaints note that “substantially all” light fixtures allegedly produced using UCSB’s filament technology are manufactured in China. Target and Walmart had knowledge of patented technology on their shelves as early as December 2017, according to court complaints, when the two stores were sent a “notice of infringement” from the university.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The strategy has been to reach out directly to the retailers because the products are primarily made overseas, which makes it impractical and difficult for UC to pursue infringement,” Levy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, UCSB made efforts to form licensing agreements with retailers outside of court, Levy said, but was stiff-armed by retailers after unsuccessful attempts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Businesses, particularly certain industry sectors like these sorts of consumer products, tend to either ignore or just discount any outreach they have from a university about their need for a license,” Levy said. “They don’t think a university is actually going to enforce those patents, so they just ignore it and carry that risk.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, in 2019, five years after patented products allegedly began saturating the market, UCSB is seeking litigation. The university was hesitant to sue, Levy said: “Litigation, especially of this scale, is a last resort.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levy noted that UCSB’s Office of Technology and Industry Alliances made “a lot of efforts to have business conversations with appropriate entities in the lighting industry,” but said they had no luck, and litigation became “necessary.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The instances when universities seek legal action over patent rights are rare, Levy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Until this case, there really are very few examples of universities directly enforcing their patent rights against industry,” Levy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s decision to seek litigation comes on the backdrop of a much larger issue in which the threat of stolen knowledge is constantly looming, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a systemic problem … It’s important for academic institutions to have tools like this available to them to make sure their rights are respected.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If UCSB is successful in court, the money would be split three ways between Longford Capital — a litigation firm working with the university — SSLEEC researchers responsible for the patents and UCSB itself, </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-07-30/uc-santa-barbara-sues-led-lightbulbs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloomberg reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

on UCSB’s campus. </span><em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Academic Researchers United (ARU) obtained signatures from over 2,200 members across the UC campuses for the petition, which were submitted to each UC campus’s respective chancellors’ offices two weeks ago. </span></p>\n<p>“Many [academic researchers (ARs)] are former [postdoctorates] who lost the benefits of having a union when they transferred to an AR position,” McGreal said in an email.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ARs like McGreal </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mentor students and colleagues and run labs daily on UCSB’s campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Neal Sweeney, vice president of UAW Local 5810, explained while academic researchers do much of the same work they did as postdoctorates, they lose the protection of UAW once they transition to titles such as project scientists, specialists, professional researchers and coordinators of public programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Sweeney, ARU formed in order to extend the union benefits postdoctorates were awarded to academic researchers after they transition job titles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These new titles were not part of the union. All the gains we had won in our contract for [postdoctorates] like higher salaries, a very good benefits plan, paid parental leave, protections against sexual [harassment] and discrimination, job security </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we lost all of these in the transition,” Sweeney said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When forming a union, ARU obtained the signatures needed for a super majority and submitted them to the state labor board in September 2018. After some initial delays, bargaining officially began in May 2019 and has been going on ever since, Sweeney said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re calling on UC to work quickly to bargain a fair contract that will ensure sustainable research careers and a more equitable, inclusive workplace,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond job security and improved pay, ARs are bargaining for protections against harassment and discrimination in the workplace, along with gender equity and inclusion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Especially in STEM fields, which most researchers are in, there’s a gender gap,” Sweeney explained. “Having these kinds of protections, like parental leave for example, has been shown to increase retention of women because women aren’t forced to choose between their career and having a family.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While delaying the contract “might seem to benefit the university,” Sweeney believes that improving the conditions for ARs at the UCs will ultimately benefit the UC more in the long run. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a connection between having better working conditions and doing better work,” he said. “When people feel more secure in their jobs, when they feel like there’s protections from [harassment] and discrimination, when they’re paid at a fair level, they can do better research.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elisa Smith, media relations representative in the UC Office of the President, said the office is “working hard to negotiate a fair agreement with the academic researchers as quickly as possible.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since this is a brand new contract, it takes some time to reach agreement as we do not have a prior bargaining agreement to work from, and considerable thought and discussion are required in chartering new territory with unique issues,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Sept. 26, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Golden State has won by an average of 12.3 points in all three meetings of this season.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, the Warriors have had an insane season breaking almost every record out there. Earning the best start in NBA history with their 24-0 hot streak, longest home winning streak of 54 wins, no back-to-back losses in the entire season, most wins on the road with a 34-7 road record, never lost to the same team twice, and to top it off most single-season wins (73) in NBA history breaking the 1995-1996 Chicago Bulls’ record!</p>\n<p>If the Rockets want a shot at taking the Warriors down they will have to do more than simply rely on James Harden. Even though he is averaging 29 points per game and is shooting at 40 percent from the three point range, his productivity will be highly limited with Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala taking turns guarding him.</p>\n<p>Another player bound to be shut down is Dwight Howard with Draymond Green and Andrew Bogut in the post. This would force the Rockets to shoot from the outside, which is exactly what the Warriors would want since Houston ranks 19th in the three-point shooting percentage. Meanwhile, the Warriors lead the category with a 42 three-point shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>Houston will really have to step up their defense to even stay alive in the next couple of games, especially when their biggest threat is the reigning league MVP himself, Steph Curry. After hitting his 402nd three-pointer on Wednesday night, the 6’3 point guard broke his own record from last year by 116 more. With a 45 three-point shooting percentage it is in the Rockets best interest to find a way to knock him of his game early in the match.</p>\n<p>The Warriors are riding on a high after an impeccable season with no signs of being stopped anytime soon, especially not by the Rockets. My predictions is an easy sweep for Golden State.</p>\n<p><strong>San Antonio Spurs (2) vs. Memphis Grizzlies (2) – Duncan MacPhee</strong></p>\n<p>The Memphis Grizzlies will travel to the AT&amp;T Center in San Antonio, Texas this Sunday, April 17 to take on the San Antonio Spurs in the first game of their first round 2-7 matchup.</p>\n<p>According to oddsshark.com, the Memphis Grizzlies are the underdogs at +9500 to win this best-of-7 series (the Spurs odds are not yet available). What might be perceived by some as a lack of respect for the Grizzlies here is partly due to the fact that the Spurs have been by far the second best team in the NBA, let alone the Western conference.</p>\n<p>With an NBA record-tying 40 wins at home this year, the Spurs have been absolutely unstoppable on their home floor. This doesn’t bode well for any team that matches up with them in the first two rounds, where the team holds home-court advantage.</p>\n<p>San Antonio ended the season with an extremely impressive 67-15 record, and yet they weren’t talked about much at all just because of the absolute dominance of the league by the 73-9 number one seed Warriors. The Spurs might almost prefer flying under the record here though, as they begin their quiet quest for the 2016 Larry O’Brien trophy.</p>\n<p>For their part, the Grizzlies do not figure to be much of a problem for this stacked Spurs lineup. Memphis lost 10 of their last 11 regular season games, and have struggled with injuries and roster turmoil all year long. They have started 28 different players this season, five more than the previous record number of starters for a playoff-bound team.</p>\n<p>The Grizz have lost their two top scorers, Marc Gasol (broken foot) and Mike Conley (Achilles tendinitis), to injury for the entirety of this postseason. As a result, Memphis fans have been forced to watch the often-cringeworthy Tony Allen and Matt Barnes show for the tail end of this regular season. And now they’ll have to sit through the same thing against the second best team in the league.</p>\n<p>A much healthier San Antonio will look to utilize younger stars Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge this postseason while also relying on the veteran presence of the always-productive Big 3 of Tony Parker, Tim Duncan, and Manu Ginobili.</p>\n<p>Luckily for Grizz faithful, the ugliness of this series won’t last longer than the minimum number of games. Spurs in four.</p>\n<p><strong>Oklahoma City Thunder (3) vs. Dallas Mavericks (6) – Elliot Thornton </strong></p>\n<p>The 2015-2016 NBA regular season has undoubtedly been one for the ages. As we say goodbye to a Laker legend in the Black Mamba and reflect on a 73-9 finish by the Golden State Warriors, a new chapter of intensified basketball arises in the 2016 NBA Playoffs. Let’s start with a scope in the Western Conference between the third seed Oklahoma City Thunder and fifth seed Dallas Mavericks.</p>\n<p>Heading into postseason with an overall record of 55-27, the high-powered duo of Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook will be key for the North West Division champions. Dallas players such as Justin Anderson, Charlie Villenueva, and Wesley Matthews will have a tough task limiting the stretch-four Durant, but the majority of its problems will be centered around the triple-double machine in Westbrook.</p>\n<p>In discussion for this year’s MVP, the five-time All-Star has 18 triple-doubles this season, accompanying NBA legends Magic Johnson and Wilt Chamberlain to record 18 or more in the past 50 years. The Thunder are currently ranked second in the league in terms of offensive efficiency, averaging 110.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>Despite two of the NBA’s most elite players, a savvy college coach in Billy Donovan, and a hardnosed frontcourt in Serge Ibaka, Enes Kanter, and Steven Adams the Dallas Mavericks have one secret ingredient which the Thunder lack: experience.</p>\n<p>In his eighth season with the Mavericks and 115 NBA playoff wins under his belt, it is safe to say that Head Coach Rick Carlisle has been in this position plenty of times. Posting its fourth straight season with 42 wins or more, the Mavs will try and utilize this veteran experience to propel them in their first round playoff series. Similar to previous seasons, longtime shooter and Dallas captain Dirk Nowitzki will carry the load for his team.</p>\n<p>Leading the team in scoring for the year at 18.3 points per game, the German native heads into his 14<sup>th</sup> official postseason with an average of 25.4 points per game. While the power forward’s resume does not equally match the 20-year vet Bryant on paper, he will likely try to parallel the Laker legend’s ability to perform under pressure.</p>\n<p>The Thunder hold a 4-0 record over the Mavericks this season. While OKC does have the upper edge with Durant and Westbrook at its side, expect a tight series throughout as three of the regular season games have been decided by four or less points.</p>\n<p><strong>(4) Los Angeles Clippers vs. Portland Trailblazers (5) – Jorge Mercado </strong></p>\n<p>Can the Clips finally get over the hump and get out of the second round? Will Damian Lillard have to average 40 points a game just to help his team win this series? Those are the big questions marking this great first round match-up between the LA Clippers and the Portland Trailblazers.</p>\n<p>These two teams are no strangers as the Clippers beat them three out of four games during their season series this year. In those three wins, LA won by an average of 9.3 points per game with the last win coming courtesy of a game winning three by shooting guard J.J Redick.</p>\n<p>While this match-up has drawn much intrigue it’s not a stretch to say that the Clippers should win this series. They definitely have the better roster led by All-star PG Chris Paul who was fourth in the NBA in assists per game (10) and second in steals (2.02).</p>\n<p>Other key players include great players such as Deandre Jordan who leads the league in field goal percentage (.702) and is second in rebounding with 13.8 per game. Redick is also a key player as he leads the league in three-point field goal percentage with a great 47 percent.</p>\n<p>However, just because the Clippers have the better roster doesn’t mean Portland is just going to give them the series. Portland has Lillard who is one of the best perimeter scorers in the NBA, and as he is helped by the possible most improved player in the league CJ McCollum.</p>\n<p>This season, Lillard averages 25 points per game on 42 percent shooting from the field and 38 percent from three-point range, while McCollum scores 21 a night with 45 percent from the field and 42 percent from deep. There’s no way these two will just let there team lose that easy.</p>\n<p>The final storyline—and quite possibly the biggest—is if Blake Griffin can bounce back or not. In the five games since his return to the Clips he has averaged 10 points, seven rebounds, and four assists. Last year in the playoffs he averaged 25.5 points, 12.7 rebounds, and 6.1 assists per game. It will be interesting to see if that guy can come back.</p>\n<p>Overall this series will be a lot of fun and definitely one you should not miss. However, i do believe the series to be a short one as I predict the Clippers win in five games.</p>\n<p>The first game tips off at Staples Center Sunday, April 17 at 7:30 PST. The game will be televised on TNT and Prime Ticket.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The transition from high school to college is a life-changing experience that varies for each individual. Nonetheless, the change is like a culture shock when coming from a different state.</p>\n<p>For junior attacker Bryn Hudson of the UCSB women’s water polo team, making the move from Oregon to California went beyond the ordinary lifestyle she was familiar with. She was born on Feb. 5, 1994 in Tualatin,Oregon, a small city with the population of just under 27,000 people. A true born and raised Oregon native, she went on and attended Tualatin High School from 2008-2012. Hudson helped win two consecutive Oregon State championships and earned various other prestigious accolades.</p>\n<p>Just like any younger sibling does, she looked up to her older brother Lucas and gives him credit for her interest in water polo.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I saw him playing water polo and it looked so much fun, and I ended up being pretty good at it,” Hudson said. “Around when I was 14 years old, I had a coach that really invested a lot in me and kind of took to me and made sure I was on the right path to the collegiate level.”</p>\n<p>Her decision to leave Tualatin for UCSB seems like an obvious decision anyone would make, but is more surreal when analyzed. The out-of-state expenses, not knowing the city and its people and being one of two players on UCSB’s roster from a different state other than California are all factors that she had to consider.</p>\n<p>“It was just kind of a feeling when I walked on campus,” Hudson said. “I saw the beach, they had my major and the girls on the team were just awesome. I was like ‘this is the school for me, this is where I want to spend the next four years of my life.’”</p>\n<p>Still, the life of a student athlete has rarely any time for relaxing. The constant practice, traveling, games and tournaments are all tasks that make finding the balance between school and sports difficult.</p>\n<p>Although coming to UCSB has undeniably been a great experience for Hudson, the time spent away from her family can be discouraging at times. Leaving her hometown for California has been the most challenging shift in her life. Not having the privilege to just pack up, leave and be home in a few hours is a disadvantage that occasionally takes a toll on the mind.</p>\n<p>“I don’t get to go home for Thanksgiving or long weekends, — I stay here,” Hudson said. “It’s really hard sometimes to see my friends go off and be with their families. I think that uprooting my whole life and moving down here without anybody else really made me grow up.”</p>\n<p>Despite not having any immediate family within the Santa Barbara area, it has been the connection with first-year Head Coach Serela Kay that has been beneficial in fully accommodating to the UCSB environment.</p>\n<p>Similar to Hudson, Kay made the decision to attend college out-of-state to play water polo at the collegiate level. An Annapolis, Maryland native, Kay played for St. Mary’s High School but left her hometown to become a four-year starter at UCLA.</p>\n<p>“I think our team is similar to how it was when I played. Our team is pretty tight,” Kay said. “Bryn lives with water polo players and they’re all close. That’s something that I definitely had when I was in school at UCLA. She’s got that on our team so that’s pretty cool.”</p>\n<p>Although winning championships and being a part of a reputable sports program are aspirations that collegiate athletes desire to play for, it’s the little things that tend to have the greatest impact.</p>\n<p>The various life lessons that sports teach athletes from their successes and failures help build character that contributes to making an impression both on and off the field.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, water polo has become more than just a game for Hudson: it has become a vital aspect of her life that has allowed her to improve as an overall person.</p>\n<p>“I think, more than anything, it has taught me to persevere and commit to things,” Hudson said. “There are definitely days where you wake up and you don’t feel good, you’re sick or you’re tired and you don’t want to go to practice, but you have to.”</p>\n<p>Life beyond the pool seems like the ideal place for these learned morals to be applied. As an aquatic biology major with an education minor, teaching is a possibility in Hudson’s future. But the Gauchos’ attacker is in no rush to leave school just yet, as she has one year of school left with plans of traveling once she graduates.</p>\n<p>Yet, the most important goal that Hudson desires to achieve is not anything that one could record on a stat sheet. Rather, being a genuine, loving individual that cares for others is a standard that comes before the game of water polo.</p>\n<p>“I definitely want people to remember me as a good, kindhearted person besides just being an athlete,” she said. “Whenever I step away from a situation, I want people to remember me in a positive way and remember that I was either kind to them or helped them out or made them laugh or feel good.”</p>\n<p>Occasionally, the uncertainty that comes with taking risks is just what a person needs to help them grow. While it is entertaining to watch college athletes and enjoy their talents, it is often more gratifying to appreciate their existence off the field.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of April 9, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62207\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/bryn-hudson-exploring-unknown-water/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62207\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/bryn-hudson-exploring-unknown-water/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/bryn-hudson-exploring-unknown-water/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/bryn-hudson-exploring-unknown-water/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-09/bryn-hudson-exploring-unknown-water/","id":2005,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[2004,2003,2002],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
