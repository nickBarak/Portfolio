The sit-in went on for 72 hours. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The money is composed of a $13.4 billion endowment and a $70 billion pension, and will be divested “as of the end of the month,” and “soon” respectively, the authors wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two financial officers, Jagdeep Singh Bachher, the chief investment officer and treasurer for the UC and Richard Sherman, chair of the UC Board of Regents Investments Committee, emphasized that the decision was not made because of “political pressure,” but because of financial reasons. However, the two acknowledged that some may “see our action as born of political pressure, or as green movement idealism or perhaps political correctness run amok.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So be it,” the two said in the op-ed. “We are part of a university system where diversity of opinion thrives.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have chosen to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invest</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a better planet, and reap the financial rewards for UC, rather than simply </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">divest</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a headline.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But several activists at UCSB, including some of those who were present at the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/chancellor-yang-agrees-to-endorse-3-billion-uc-divestment-from-fossil-fuels-after-72-hour-sit-in/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">72-hour protest</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> held in Cheadle Hall in 2017 by Fossil Free UCSB, said the UC’s decision to divest stemmed from years of student and faculty activism across the campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In particular, they believed a recent vote held by the UC Academic Senates, which found 77% of senate members wished to divest from fossil fuels, was a leading factor as opposed to financial reasons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Ph.D. student Emily Williams, one of the founders of Fossil Free UC and a part of the Cheadle Hall protest, said she was “speechless and overwhelmed” at the news but denounced the claim that the decision was done for “purely for financial reasons.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They have to say that,” Williams said bluntly, explaining that she believes if the UC said they had divested from fossil fuels for moral reasons rather than financial reasons, there would be “mounting pressure” to divest from other movements like the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/four-years-later-still-a-no-for-israel-divestment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Williams noted that Bachher and Sherman’s argument that fossil fuel investments are risky is something that the Fossil Free UC movement has been arguing since its inception. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Them making that decision was really the result of years of students and faculty and alums, finally chancellors getting on board, really advocating for this,” she said. “They wouldn’t necessarily have even given this a look had the campaign not have advocated for it so strongly.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several other UCSB climate activists — Ph.D. global studies student Theo LeQuesne, fourth-year political science major Cassie Macy and sociology professor John Foran — echoed Williams’ opinions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m just happy to come to some closure on this, it’s been a fantastic movement,” Foran said. “It should not have taken, of course, six years. We’re not delighted by the reasoning given by the Regents, that it’s [a] purely economic decision, we think that’s kind of not true.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It doesn’t acknowledge the fact that there was a movement demanding it, without which we wouldn’t be here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fossil Free UC was founded by students across the UC system in 2012. For the past several years, the group has held demonstrations at campuses including </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2016/05/06/uc-berkeley-students-and-alumni-stage-sit-in-at-uc-office-of-the-president/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and UCSB, all to encourage the Regents to divest from fossil fuels – but LeQuesne emphasized that it has been a long path to victory. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We started off kind of really taking the UC Regents as equals and [we were] really interested in trying to work with them,” LeQuesne said. “But about a year or two into that process, it because pretty clear that the UC Regents were not particularly interested in actually making this going forward.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He explained that around 2015, the group changed its strategy, moving toward “mobilizing the community approach.” They decided to get “more disruptive,” he said – “a more disruptive kind of movement, build approach necessary to really get the Regents to pay attention to us.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group organized across UC campuses, campaigning to get all student governments to endorse the divestment and organizing sit-ins. LeQuesne emphasized that one of the movement’s biggest successes was the 2017 Cheadle Hall sit-in, during which over 100 students sat in Cheadle Hall for over 72 hours until Chancellor Yang agreed to endorse students’ demands for fossil fuel divestment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Williams, who was present at the sit-in, said it was “powerful” to be there in that moment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a bit of nervousness because what you’re ultimately doing is civil disobedience,” she emphasized. “You’re doing something that is against the rules, but you’re doing it because you have so much respect for the institution and for the cause that you’re working on that you really feel like you need to take a step and do something, draw attention to it and make a change.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While climate activists at UCSB were happy to finally see the Regents take tangible action for climate justice, Foran said divesting from fossil fuels is only the first step for the UC in the “overarching global climate justice movement.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a small step in a long journey,” Foran said. “We’re up against the most powerful corporations in the history of the world and the governments they control. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But today is a good day in that struggle.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Macy, who was a first-year student during the 2017 sit-in and is now entering her last year at UCSB, her next steps are to ensure the UC “follow[s] their promises and fully divest,” but she’s also working on refilling the ranks now that many climate activists have graduated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The next steps are finding some people who can take the place of them and take the place of me in the future and just keep fighting for this environmental change,” Macy said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foran and Williams also pointed to the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-15/in-photos-11-minutes-for-11-years-youth-climate-strike-takes-over-arbor/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunrise Movement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as the next generation of climate activism at UCSB, and Williams referenced the </span><a href=\"https://globalclimatestrike.net/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">global climate strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> scheduled for Sept. 20-27. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[This is] for the fate of the planet. The fate of humanity is at stake here, so we’re glad we could nudge the Regents to do the right thing, however begrudgingly,” Foran said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

As all the teams wore gray warm-up shirts saying “MLK,” this day really hit home for one specific team, the Memphis Grizzlies.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A city that first handedly experienced the works of this peace promoter, the Bluff State hosted their 13<sup>th</sup> annual MLK Day matchup. In a packed FedEx Forum Arena with roughly over 18,000 in attendance, Grizzlies fans paid homage to a figure whose leadership permeated the streets of Tennessee.</p>\n<p>In April of 1968, King traveled to Memphis supporting a coalition of African-American workers and their fight for equal working conditions. King was a steady activist for the Memphis Sanitation Strike addressing this poor treatment and racial discrimination clearly to then-city mayor Henry Loeb.</p>\n<p>Following his infamous “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop” speech, King checked into the local Lorraine Hotel, now the National Civil Rights Museum. This was where the abolitionist lived his final days as he was assassinated on April 4, 1968. While King’s death marked the end of the 39-year olds civil activism, to this day his presence lives on for the people of Memphis as well as within the Grizzlies organization.</p>\n<p>Starting guard Tony Allen acknowledged how Dr. King stood for more than just social equality, but also for athletes like himself to continue their passion of sports. “Martin Luther King paved the way for guys like myself to have the opportunity to be around now, Allen told NBA reporter Mark Jones. “It felt good to be honoring [this man] and playing on this day.”</p>\n<p>Grizzly big man Zach Randolph also touched on MLK’s special day stating, “What [King] did for us was to give us freedom, someway or somehow. Racism still exists in this world today, but he was a leader and he showed other African-Americans that they could be anything they wanted to be and they could speak from their heart and live the dream and do the right thing,” Randolph told USA Today. “Nobody can tell you what to do and you believe in yourself.”</p>\n<p>What stood as a regulatory match between two NBA teams spoke volumes to the city of Memphis, a region who shared the memories of Dr. King and his civil quest for freedom. His dream and passions still live on through MLK day.</p>\n<p>His vision has given basketball an essence of peace, the ability to experience the passions and competitive spirit of a sport with others regardless of their ethnicity or skin tone. Dr. King will continue to hold a thriving legacy through the Grizzlies’ classic MLK Day match, giving others, both athletes and NBA fans, the encouragement to “Dream BIG”.</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_67531\" style=\"width: 618px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67531\" data-attachment-id=\"67531\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/mlk-day-prolongs-the-legacy-of-dr-king-and-is-central-to-the-memphis-grizzlies-franchise/dream-big/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/dream-big.png?fit=590%2C358&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"590,358\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"dream big\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/dream-big.png?fit=250%2C152&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/dream-big.png?fit=590%2C358&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-67531\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/dream-big.png?resize=608%2C369\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of fansided.com\" width=\"608\" height=\"369\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/dream-big.png?w=590&amp;ssl=1 590w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/dream-big.png?resize=250%2C152&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67531\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of fansided.com</p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67529\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/mlk-day-prolongs-the-legacy-of-dr-king-and-is-central-to-the-memphis-grizzlies-franchise/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67529\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/mlk-day-prolongs-the-legacy-of-dr-king-and-is-central-to-the-memphis-grizzlies-franchise/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/mlk-day-prolongs-the-legacy-of-dr-king-and-is-central-to-the-memphis-grizzlies-franchise/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/mlk-day-prolongs-the-legacy-of-dr-king-and-is-central-to-the-memphis-grizzlies-franchise/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/mlk-day-prolongs-the-legacy-of-dr-king-and-is-central-to-the-memphis-grizzlies-franchise/","id":1995,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1994,1993,1992],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ball Is Life?

For people like me, Kobe <em>was</em> life.</p>\n<p>My first memory as a toddler was my mother teaching me to say “please” when asking for my bottle. After that, all I remember is the number eight, the coolest afro I’ve ever seen and Chick Hearn’s magnificent voice saying “Slaaaam dunk!”</p>\n<p>The first videogame I ever remember playing was “Kobe Bryant in NBA Courtside” for the Nintendo 64. I can still see the first tip-off I ever took part in with the computer’s David Robinson rising high over my Shaquille O’Neal because I didn’t know the buttons yet at the age of four.</p>\n<p>The first Christmas present I ever remember getting was a mini basketball hoop which I played on all day, every day, annoying the crap out of my sisters while I pretended I was Kobe and practiced his moves.</p>\n<p>When I started Kindergarten, my dad told me he would take me to the front row of a Laker game if I learned how to read. It took me about three weeks. What more motivation did I need?</p>\n<p>For the game, I made a poster that said, “Kobe, 360 for me.” He did. And he winked at me after.</p>\n<p>Over the years, my range of emotions became one with the rises and falls of Kobe and the Lakers. Life had its own stresses and challenges, but I only ever experienced true heartbreak or happiness when I was watching him play.</p>\n<p>It meant everything to me. His success was my success, his embarrassments were my embarrassments.</p>\n<p>I’m not one to cry very often, but when Kobe hit those two shots against Phoenix in Game Four of the first round in 2006, I ran around the house screaming as an ocean of tears fell from my eyes.</p>\n<p>How many of us have had to read the YouTube comments on Kobe’s top career plays only to see people asking, “Why is this number one? It was in the first round and they lost the series.” If you ever had to ask that, then you’ll never know.</p>\n<p>When the Lakers defeated the Orlando Magic in the 2009 NBA Finals, giving Kobe his first ring without Shaq, I smiled, teary-eyed, as I reflected upon the long, stressful road to that moment. I remembered where I was during every second of his career: what I was up to in school, who my friends were at the time, the sheer happiness I felt from seeing him hit shot after shot to bring his team back over and over again. It’s all one and the same.</p>\n<p>If there is a reason why I’m able to remember so much about my life growing up, it’s because Kobe made just about every day something worth remembering.</p>\n<p>If there is a reason why I’m writing this article today, it’s because he showed me that loving sports is more than just a hobby. For those with true passion, it is a lifestyle.</p>\n<p>He taught me how to hope, how to care, how to want something and how to go get it no matter who’s standing in the way. He taught me how to be an asshole on the court, he taught me to be a ballhog and he taught me how to win. He set the bar so high that even when I excelled in anything, I felt I needed to do better.</p>\n<p>Numbers never meant a damn thing to Kobe. He never wanted to play by anyone’s rules other than his own, and, thank God, he never did. All he ever wanted was to win, and for a good while, he was the best at it.</p>\n<p>People can bring up all the shooting percentages, stats and figures they want, but the fact is, when Kobe was on the court, that was what made the Lakers, well … the Lakers. He embodied everything that was great about the greatest organization in basketball.</p>\n<p>Ever since he tore his Achilles back in 2013, I’ve felt like I’ve been missing something. It might sound stupid, but life no longer makes sense the way it used to. We’ve been fearing the end of his career for so long, but now that it’s finally here, I’m still not sure how I can possibly accept it. Rooting for him is all I’ve ever known.</p>\n<p>Yeah, it hurts to see him play the way he’s playing right now. It hurts to hear him admitting defeat after games. I don’t enjoy watching him shoot 1-14 one night, listen to him talk about how bad he played and how much pain he’s in, then see him go 4-20 a few nights later.</p>\n<p>But if there’s one thing I’ve loved about Kobe all these years, it’s that no matter what anyone says or thinks, he will always be Kobe. “He shoots too much.” “He needs to learn how to pass.” “He’s not a good leader.” We heard it back in 1999 before the Lakers won three straight championships, we heard it back in 2006 when his starting lineup included Kwame Brown and Smush Parker and we heard it in 2010 when he was still winning championships.</p>\n<p>So who cares if people are still saying it today?</p>\n<p>Most of the athletes who have reached out to honor Kobe since his announcement have all sent messages revolving around the same theme: how much he has inspired them. His work ethic is legendary, his ability to get the job done against all odds is legendary. His fire, ferocity and killer nature will go down in history as possibly the greatest ever.</p>\n<p>The media can say what it wants, but the league’s current stars are the ones who grew up watching him play. They’re the ones who battled and lost to him time and time again, hoping to someday surpass his shadow. And they’re the ones who have spoken up to give him the admiration he deserves.</p>\n<p>Kobe is the last link between what the NBA was and what it is now. He is the bridge between the Michael Jordan era, basketball of the 90s and the end of Showtime, to whatever the hell we see out there today with free-throws, weak fouls and three-pointers filling up the box scores.</p>\n<p>He is the last of a dying breed that will be extinct by the end of this season. He is tradition.</p>\n<p>If he doesn’t make a shot the rest of his life, let’s just enjoy watching him while we can. Few people in the basketball world have had the kind of impact that a man like Kobe Bryant has. Few teams have been spoiled the way Laker fans have been all these years.</p>\n<p>Kobe Bryant has been both the NBA’s greatest enemy and greatest hero. Now, love him or hate him, let’s send him off the right way.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66851\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/ball-is-life-no-kobe-is/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66851\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/ball-is-life-no-kobe-is/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/ball-is-life-no-kobe-is/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/ball-is-life-no-kobe-is/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/ball-is-life-no-kobe-is/","id":1994,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1993,1992,1991],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Competitive Edge Translated","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_005-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_005-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Her life has revolved around volleyball for a vast majority of her life, but that hasn't stopped Emilia Petrachi from outperforming opponents in other forms of competition as well.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_66599\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_005-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1516152861\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66598\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66599\" data-attachment-id=\"66599\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/the-competitive-edge-translated/eric_swenson_nexus_womens_vball_9-11_vs_smu_cropped_005-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Eric_Swenson_Nexus_Womens_VBall_9.11_vs_SMU_cropped_005-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Eric Swenson\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"Emilia Petrachi shifts her weight in preparation for a hard outside hit straight to her.

Eric Swenson/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Balance is an integral facet of life, particularly if you are a student-athlete. Finding a way to juggle responsibilities concerning classes, personal matters and having to play on a weekly basis is no collegiate lifestyle that any individual can embrace.</p>\n<p>For freshman Emilia Petrachi, starting libero for the UCSB women’s volleyball team, this balance came before her status as a NCAA Division I athlete. Having trained and played volleyball for more than a decade, she comes from a country where the sport has thrived.</p>\n<p>“Growing up in Modena — it’s a small town, really quiet,” Petrachi said. “There’s not much going on there, but volleyball is a big thing in Italy.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>She attended and played high school volleyball for Liceo Classico San Carlo. While Petrachi played well at the high school level, she excelled at the club platform, playing for Liu Jo (LJ) Volley. Petrachi joined the club in 2013 and was placed on its Series A2 team.</p>\n<p>The decision to place her on the secondary team did not persist as her talent prompted her promotion to the Series A1 team in August 2013, making her the youngest member of the club for the remainder of the year and the following 2014-15 season. Petrachi’s addition to the club’s premier team was justified by her winning of the region’s Best Libero award in 2014.</p>\n<p>Her performance on the court exceeded the expectation that she would have a developmental role on the team, but being the club’s youngest member was overwhelming at times, as she wasn’t the only elite talent on the court anymore.</p>\n<p>“Being the youngest was hard because I needed to catch up with the experience of the others,” Petrachi said. “There were people that were 35 years old, 20 years old and myself as the youngest. But it for sure helped my growth as a volleyball player and person.”</p>\n<p>At the pinnacle of her volleyball career, Petrachi possessed veteran talent, but as a youth she was dealing with the responsibilities and pressures of playing school and club volleyball.</p>\n<p>While she was a vital asset to her high school’s volleyball team, Petrachi discovered a balancing component to her performance on the court that offered a unique twist to her identity as a competitor.</p>\n<p>This three-round translation competition is known as the Certamen Carolinum, testing students on their ability to translate Ancient Greek and Latin. It’s a form of competition that is reminiscent of a spelling bee, but with a foreign pizzazz that makes it just a tad bit more intriguing.</p>\n<p>Once introduced, it became the newest task that Petrachi was determined to conquer.</p>\n<p>Her fear of failure proved unfit for a competitor of her caliber. While learning a multitude of languages is common and tends to be innate within the European culture, Petrachi’s trouncing of the competition was unforeseen as she became a three-time winner.</p>\n<p>She won the translation competition twice in Latin and once in Ancient Greek, two languages that are convergent of her native language of Italian.</p>\n<p>“I like competition — I like to be the best in everything that I do,” Petrachi said. “It came naturally because I liked it and I wanted to be the best.”</p>\n<p>Although a well-known individual for her play on the court, it wasn’t Petrachi’s notoriety as a libero which earned her the opportunity to participate in the competition. In addition to being selected by a former high school teacher, her merits in the classroom and pure enjoyment for the competition led to her continued involvement.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t feel the pressure,” Petrachi said. “I competed really loosely, without the fear of losing.”</p>\n<p>Despite UCSB’s offering of courses in translation studies, no competition similar to the Certamen Carolinum exists. Although her schedule as a student-athlete wouldn’t permit time to create a rendition of the competition on campus, Petrachi remains confident with her translation abilities.</p>\n<p>“If there will ever be a competition, I will be ready to attend it,” she jokingly said.</p>\n<p>The story of a student-athlete succeeding off the court in an activity such as a translation competition may be striking for many, but it is Petrachi’s method in her decision to attend UCSB that is even more shocking, making her UCSB’s first international athlete in nearly 15 years.</p>\n<p>The college recruiting process is an exhausting experience for student-athletes — coaches calling at all times of the day with recruiting pitches, university visits, expectations of friends and family and the pressure of deciding where to dedicate the next four years of their life are all influences that help determine athletes’ future collegiate careers.</p>\n<p>For some prospects, their sights have always been focused on a dream college and are fulfilled with a scholarship offer. In today’s generation of sports, in which middle schoolers end up on high school teams and off seasons are submerged in training, young athletes in their pre-teens even receive offers from universities.</p>\n<p>However, the stresses of the recruiting process do not always follow suit. Guiding Petrachi’s decision to attend UCSB was a rare approach: intuition.</p>\n<p>Petrachi had never been to California. Visits to New York and Jacksonville, Florida served as her introductions to the American lifestyle. Still, this time could not make up for a lifetime in another country.</p>\n<p>Unlike most students, who are able to seek comfort from their families just hours away, Petrachi’s busy schedule also doesn’t permit the time for traveling the 5,000-plus mile distance that separates her and family in Italy.</p>\n<p>“It’s been tough because it’s a completely different world,” Petrachi said. “I didn’t know what to expect. I didn’t visit the campus or meet the coaches before coming here.”</p>\n<p>One Skype conversation with the team and personal research of the university were her only ideas of life in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Despite her unfamiliarity with the city, new team and coaching staff prior to the start of the season, Petrachi’s decision to attend UCSB didn’t solely revolve around her future in volleyball.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to come to a place where I would feel good even if I wasn’t playing volleyball,” she said. “I know volleyball can be upsetting at times. I needed a place in which I could shake off the homesickness. It’s [UCSB] right on the beach, I.V. is a little community, and it’s great and I’m happy.”</p>\n<p>Enjoying her new journey as a Gaucho, Petrachi’s first-year with the UCSB women’s volleyball team has been impressive despite the team’s struggles this season.</p>\n<p>Her overall average of 4.73 digs per set ranks second in the Big West Conference while she ranks third overall in the conference with 407 total digs. Petrachi is just one of three players in the Big West to break the 400 mark this season and recently earned her second Freshman Player of the Week award on Monday.</p>\n<p>She is 88 digs away from reaching former Gaucho Leah Sully’s single-season record of 495 digs, which ranks 10th all-time in program history.</p>\n<p>“It’s been an honor to become the libero for this team,” Petrachi said. “I try to give the best that I have. I want to be in the top five because I know that I can be in there. It’s an honor that I owe to the team.”</p>\n<p>Trusting her instincts to guide her future, Petrachi knows that UCSB is the right place for her and is appreciative of Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch for the opportunity to play on her team.</p>\n<p>“She went beyond the role of being a coach,” said Petrachi. “She helped me with integrating with the girls, making me meet people and ask questions. I’d probably be lost without her.”</p>\n<p>At 7-18 overall, 3-11 in conference play and with two matches remaining this season, UCSB is still young and will have to find a way to fill in the void of losing five seniors at the end of the year.</p>\n<p>But the future is promising for UCSB, especially with the tremendous talent and competitiveness that Petrachi has to offer.</p>\n<p>A gut feeling suggests that Petrachi will be the centerpiece in helping translate the Gauchos’ upside for the future.</p>\n<p>For more information on the Certamen Corlinum translation competition, visit its official website: www.certamencarolinum.de</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of November 19, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66598\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/the-competitive-edge-translated/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66598\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/the-competitive-edge-translated/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/the-competitive-edge-translated/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/the-competitive-edge-translated/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/the-competitive-edge-translated/","id":1993,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1992,1991,1990],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
