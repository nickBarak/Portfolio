Yang during a May 2017 sit-in. Yang agreed to the demands but students are still concerned that the university has not taken enough action to reform sexual assault policies. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students at a town hall on Thursday continued to express their frustration with UC Santa Barbara administration, which they say has not fully addressed previously agreed-upon demands to reform sexual assault policies at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The town hall, hosted by Student Activist Network, addressed one of the demands, which requires UC President Janet Napolitano to tour sexual assault and sexual violence town halls on UC campuses once a year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robin Holmes Sullivan, vice president for Student Affairs at the University of California Office of the President (UCOP), attended the town hall as a representative for Napolitano.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students initially presented the demands to Chancellor Henry T. Yang during at a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">May 2017 sit- in</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These demands elaborated on a previous list of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/nowUCsb13InitialDemandsforChancellorYang.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">13 demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which students presented to Yang at a May 2015 sit-in in Cheadle Hall. In both cases, Yang agreed to the students’ demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel was composed of UCSB administrators, Title IX Student Advisory Board representative Jennifer Selvidge and Ro’Shawndra Earvin, who led the initial sit-in when Chancellor Yang signed the 2017 list of demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang did not attend the meeting because he was in Sacramento advocating for UC funding, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn explained at the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn said Yang had made a personal commitment to Earvin prior to the town hall that he would raise money for the Survivor Fund at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday, Earvin posted on social media a screenshot of an email she had sent to Yang, in which she told the chancellor that he had been unresponsive to her emails. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It worries me that you have not consistently followed up with the issues presented to you on that day,” she wrote. ”I am sure you understand that directing me to your assistants is insufficient, as your name is on the contract as well.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn said all of the demands from 2015 had been addressed. Some of the demands from last May are still in progress, like a demand for a Survivor Resource Center and an Isla Vista report card for sexual assault incidents, she said. She suggested partnering with a family justice center to address the former demand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Selvidge disagreed with Klawunn and said three of the original 13 demands have still not been met. Selvidge, who told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">she is a survivor of assault, read through the demands she considers incomplete.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the demands requires increasing female presence on the I.V. Foot Patrol (IVFP) and training all IVFP personnel to deal with sexual violence and harassment. Another states that there should be accountability and oversight of the Office of Judicial Affairs (OJA) for past mishandling of sexual assault cases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still another of these demands requires placing an additional Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education Office (C.A.R.E.) advocate in the Santa Catalina Residence Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just need the university to run what they signed for,” Earvin said. “That’s the reason why I am here. Our agenda is ‘demand completion.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earvin also expressed frustration that her name had been used without her permission in an Associated Students (A.S.) Senate resolution. The resolution proposed using a mobile application called Sprigeo to combat sexual assault and sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators Kristen Armellini and Grecia Martinez authored the resolution, which was presented at the Feb. 7 Senate meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have never felt so disrespected,” Earvin said. “Apparently you had a story when you created the app, why did you use my story?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the Feb. 7 meeting, UCSB alumna Alejandra Melgoza also expressed concern  because her name was mentioned in the resolution without her permission.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Using my name without consent is perpetuating the same acts of violence,” Melgoza said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators Alexandra Gessesse and Andrea Reyes said the authors of the resolution should have approached the individuals before including their names. Gessesse said that regardless of when the resolution was written, the fact that Earvin and Melgoza had not been contacted was “exploitation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earvin emphasized that her main initiative since the May sit-in was to fulfill the list of demands, including full payment of her UC tuition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Run that tuition and run this resource center,” Earvin said. </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

to bypass the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the second level of the federal court process, by having the Supreme Court review an order made in January.</p>\n<p>The January court order by Federal Judge William Alsup, which temporarily blocked Trump’s attempt to end DACA, also involved the UC’s lawsuit against the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>UC President Janet Napolitano filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security in September, claiming the repeal of DACA violated the rights of people who benefit from the program.</p>\n<p>The UC announced in a statement on Monday that they are pleased the Supreme Court has denied the government’s appeal.</p>\n<p>“Now that the administration’s extraordinary maneuver has been rightfully rejected, we look forward to defending U.S. District Judge Alsup’s injunction in the Court of Appeals,” the statement said.</p>\n<p>U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez in Calif. ruled on Monday that Trump cannot rescind DACA protection without giving its recipients notice in order to legally defend themselves. This allows the Obama-era program more time to protect young undocumented immigrants.</p>\n<p>Gutierrez’s preliminary injunction states that the administration cannot take away recipients’ individual protection under DACA.</p>\n<p>After declining Trump’s request, the Department of Homeland Security will continue to accept DACA renewal applications for existing recipients, while the DACA court case will continue through the regular federal court processes.</p>\n<p>Trump announced in September that he would end DACA by March 5. With less than a week to go until that date, Monday’s ruling is seen as a win for the nearly 700,000 young immigrants that are protected from deportation under DACA.</p>\n<p>March 5 was seen as a deadline for Congress to take bipartisan action on immigration reform, which resulted in a three-day government shutdown last month. That deadline is now void, since the ruling gives Congress more time to make a decision on a long-term bill.</p>\n<p>The court process is expected to take months, which may allow Congress time to pass a long-term spending bill for DACA and immigration reform. However, it may also delay action due to a lack of urgency, since the federal court process will likely pick up in October during the Supreme Court’s new term.</p>\n<p>Monday’s ruling is the third time a lower court has ruled against Trump’s rescindment of DACA, which essentially deems his efforts illegal and allows the program to continue past March 5.</p>\n<p>The first was in January, an action Trump attempted to appeal on Monday. It allowed recipients to continue renewing their work permits and DACA status.</p>\n<p>The second attempt on Feb. 13 stated that the terms by which the Trump administration ended DACA were unaccountable and arbitrary.</p>\n<p>Both rulings allowed only current DACA recipients to renew their status, but do not allow those who never applied before the rescindment to apply for the program.</p>\n<p>Monday’s ruling once again blocks Trump’s attempts to end DACA, but focuses more on individual protection rather than work permit status renewal.</p>\n<p>The UC said in their statement Monday that it was “inappropriate for the Trump administration to short circuit standard appellate procedure and attempt to skip the U.S. Court of Appeals.”</p>\n<p>They claim it was “a precipitous approach that echoes the government’s procedurally improper rescission of DACA at the heart of this case.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 5 of the March 1, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81694\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/supreme-court-declines-trumps-appeal-to-review-federal-daca-court-case/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81694\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/supreme-court-declines-trumps-appeal-to-review-federal-daca-court-case/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/supreme-court-declines-trumps-appeal-to-review-federal-daca-court-case/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/supreme-court-declines-trumps-appeal-to-review-federal-daca-court-case/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/supreme-court-declines-trumps-appeal-to-review-federal-daca-court-case/","id":2330,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2329,2328,2327],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.
