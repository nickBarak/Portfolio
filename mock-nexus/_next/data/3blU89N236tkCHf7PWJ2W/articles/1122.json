Redshirt junior guard Coco Miller led the way for the Gauchos with five quick points, as she helped create a three-point lead at the end of the first quarter. Miller has been the squad’s most reliable scorer as she is averaging a team high 13 points per game this year.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore guard Keilanei Cooper was the early spark for Riverside as she had eight points, including two three-pointers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second quarter would be a defensive battle between both squads, which was a stark contrast from the first quarter. Senior forward Malou De Kergret for UCR struggled mightily in the period as she went one for eight from the field. UCSB would head into halftime with a one point lead, as they looked to make their second half adjustments to extend their lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara ended up dominating the third quarter as they outscored the highlanders by nine points. Miller was on fire as she knocked down three three-pointers, giving her 16 points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although she has been inconsistent at times, Miller has been huge for the ‘Chos in their wins. As the group’s best scorer, she has shown the ability to not only knock down three-point shots but also attack the basket. With the season coming close to the end, many fans will look forward to seeing her take her game to another level next season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB would carry this momentum into the fourth quarter and win the game fairly comfortably by 17 points. Sophomore guard Danae Miller was able to find her rhythm late in the ball game as she scored nine points. Jones checked into the game with two minutes remaining but was unable to score on her layup attempt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This may have been the Gauchos best defensive quarter all season as they held the highlanders to just five points and 14 percent from the field. UCR was unable to find any rhythm on offense due to the consistent ball pressure and good defense by Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this being a rebuilding season for UCSB, there is much to be excited about for next season. Everyone from the team except Paris Jones will be returning, allowing the team to grow together with little turnover. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos have shown flashes throughout the year but have not been able to string together victories. With the squad continuing to develop their chemistry, they will surely make an impact in the Big West Conference for the next couple seasons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It would have been easy for Santa Barbara to stop giving their best effort during their tough stretches but head coach Bonnie Henrickson was able to keep the team on course. By continuing to play hard, the team has started to be rewarded by getting more wins.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their past five matchups, UCSB has been able to win three of them, showing that they have taken major strides from earlier in the year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They will put their two game winning streak on the line this upcoming Saturday in their last game of the regular season at 2:30 p.m against UC Davis. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86619\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-04/gauchos-take-down-highlanders-for-second-consecutive-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86619\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-04/gauchos-take-down-highlanders-for-second-consecutive-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-04/gauchos-take-down-highlanders-for-second-consecutive-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-04/gauchos-take-down-highlanders-for-second-consecutive-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-04/gauchos-take-down-highlanders-for-second-consecutive-win/","id":1121,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[1120,1119,1118],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Lose Three, Gain Six With Latest Additions","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB softball starts offseason with six recruits","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_63880\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Softball_vsUCR-20150502-DustinHarris-2-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1355772755\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"63905\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63880\" data-attachment-id=\"63880\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/gauchos-lose-three-gain-six-with-latest-additions/softball_vsucr-20150502-dustinharris-2-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Softball_vsUCR-20150502-DustinHarris-2-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"8\",\"credit\":\"Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"DeJanee Moore carefully watches for a good ball to hit.

Perhaps, the biggest impact will be the Gauchos’ addition of three new pitchers.</p>\n<p>Pitching was a major weak spot for the Gauchos last season. After an injury derailed the career of star pitcher Shelby Wisdom, the staff simply didn’t have the firepower to compete. The team finished with a combined ERA of 5.45 and gave up 42 home runs over the course of the season.</p>\n<p>Leading the new freshman pitching class is Veronika Gulvin. Gulvin is ranked 75th in the state, and during her senior season at Dos Pueblos High School she sported a 0.57 ERA with 10 shutouts in 16 games started. She also proved to be dangerous at the plate, hitting .390 for 18 RBIs and three home runs.</p>\n<p>The other two incoming pitchers are Claudia Puente and Ashley Wright. Puente is ranked 103rd in the state and helped her team to a 22-10 overall record with a 9-1 league mark in her senior season at Bullard High School.</p>\n<p>Wright pitched for the So-Cal Breakers club softball team and played four years of varsity softball at Mission Hills High School. In 2014, Wright was named Varsity Softball 1st Team All-League and was the team MVP for her high school.</p>\n<p>Rounding out the incoming class are three infielders with a slew of offensive talent. Infielder Sierra Altmeyer is ranked 25th in the state and 52nd nationally. In her senior season at Patrick Henry High School, she hit at a .415 batting average earning seven home runs and an impressive 43 RBIs.</p>\n<p>Infielder Whitney Pemberton is ranked 67th in the state and 165th nationally. During her senior season at Warren High School, she hit an incredible .528 for 31 RBIs and six home runs. She also scored 26 runs and had a .916 slugging percentage.</p>\n<p>Infielder Melanie Menor will be the final incoming recruit. Menor attended Gregori High School and is ranked 151st in the state. During her senior season, she averaged a .341 hitting percentage for 18 RBIs and 21 runs scored.</p>\n<p>“This group will give us more depth and options offensively and defensively,” Galicinao said. “Especially since we are adding three more arms to our bullpen.”</p>\n<p>In addition to the young talent, UCSB will benefit from the return of sophomore outfielder Jacqueline Hinojosa, junior catcher MeShalon Moore and sophomore outfielder Kristen Clark.</p>\n<p>Moore was recently named First Team All-Big West and Clark was awarded second team honors. After a tremendous breakout season, Hinojosa was an honorable mention.</p>\n<p>With a batting order that remains one of the best in the conference and a strengthened bullpen, the Gauchos could be top contenders to capture the Big West title next season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 28, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63905\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/gauchos-lose-three-gain-six-with-latest-additions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63905\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/gauchos-lose-three-gain-six-with-latest-additions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/gauchos-lose-three-gain-six-with-latest-additions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/gauchos-lose-three-gain-six-with-latest-additions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/gauchos-lose-three-gain-six-with-latest-additions/","id":1119,"author":{"id":66,"name":"Martin Cobos"},"related":[1118,1117,1116],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Remains on the Road, Will Participate in Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Softball_vsCSUN-20150412-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Softball_vsCSUN-20150412-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB softball team will look to possibly pull off some upsets as three of the five opponents it will face at the Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic are nationally ranked within the Top 25.

Binghamton will attempt to improve its overall finish of 24-21 in the 2015 season. Expectations have heightened for the Bearcats after being dubbed the first place favorite in the American East Conference preseason poll. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Binghamton returns this year with a trio of First-Team All-Conference players. Senior infielder Lisa Cadogan is the Bearcats’ primary catalyst in a majority of games as she led the team in virtually all offensive categories last season.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2015, she was 19th in the nation with 0.36 doubles per game, 25th in RBI’s per game with 1.18 and boasted a batting average of .429, which ranked second in the America East Conference. Certainly, the Gauchos will hope to contain her power and accuracy at the plate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara will also face the No. 11 Washington Huskies on Friday. The Huskies went 4-0 in their opening weekend and are hoping to build off the momentum of their incredible overall record of 42-17 last year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A key component to Washington’s success was sophomore infielder/outfielder Taylor Van Zee. She finished her freshman season batting .357, and was named to the PAC 12 All-Freshman team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos’ difficult stretch of games continues with two more nationally ranked opponents on Saturday. Starting at 9:30 a.m., the Gauchos will take on No. 25 Texas A&amp;M and No. 4 LSU.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently 4-1, Texas A&amp;M finished with a solid overall record of 40-20 last season. Returning to its batting lineup are several players who hit over .300 last year. Sophomore infielder Tori Vidales holds the team’s second highest batting average at a .417 clip and is fresh off a team-high 51 runs scored in 2015.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Texas A&amp;M possesses a respectable offense, its pitching rotation has weakened with the loss of senior pitcher Rachel Fox, who totaled a team-high 182 strikeouts and a 23-14 record in her final season. The Gauchos will look to capitalize against the Aggies’ youth in pitching, which only has one senior in the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LSU comes into the tournament with a record of 4-1. After suffering its only loss against Pacific, LSU exploded for a 10-1 victory over Pacific in a rematch the next day. Guiding the Tigers’ redemptive win were two of their best hitters in junior outfielder Bailey Landry and senior infielder Bianka Bell.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bell helped to bring in four runs while Landry recorded two hits and an RBI in the win. Both currently own batting averages above .400, providing the Gauchos’ pitching rotation with </span></p>\n<p>UCSB will finish its tournament playing host team Bethune-Cookman on Sunday.  With a respectable 3-2 record after its opening weekend, Bethune-Cookman received honors for two of its prized rookie players.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freshman pitcher Deidra Genera was named the league’s pitcher of the week, while freshman infielder Brianna Sanders picked up rookie of the week. With young players having such an immediate impact, Bethune-Cookman is a team the Gauchos cannot overlook. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara has a challenging series of games in this weekend’s Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic. However, Head Coach Brie Galicinao knows exactly what her team needs to do to successfully approach them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to take care of the little things on defense and pitching and continue to score big on offense. If the team continues to hit and score every game while our defense and pitching irons out some things, we’ll be in every single game,” Galicinao said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the Gauchos taking on such strong lineups this weekend, the pitching staff will be feeling the heat, but the Gauchos’ defense will come ready to play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With disciplined power hitters, we just have to be smart about our pitching call strategy and knowing how to best challenge hitters,” Galicinao explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After facing just one ranked opponent last weekend in No. 9 Arizona, UCSB will face its most difficult set of games as it will face three nationally ranked teams this weekend: No. 4 LSU, No. 11 Washington and No. 25 Texas A&amp;M. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game action will start against the Binghamton Bearcats this Friday, Feb. 19 at 12:30 p.m. The Gauchos will face Washington later that day at 3 p.m. Its Saturday doubleheader on Feb. 20 will begin at 9:30 a.m. against Texas A&amp;M and LSU at 3 p.m. Ending UCSB’s weekend will be its game against Bethune-Cookman at 2 p.m. on Sunday, Feb. 21. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68345\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-on-the-road-for-another-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68345\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-on-the-road-for-another-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-on-the-road-for-another-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-on-the-road-for-another-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-on-the-road-for-another-tournament/","id":1120,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1119,1118,1117],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
