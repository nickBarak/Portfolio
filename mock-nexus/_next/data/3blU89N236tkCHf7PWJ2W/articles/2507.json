Following the afternoon discussion in El Centro, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn said UCSB was making the group’s demands a high priority.</p>\n<p>“I think you can tell that we’re taking this seriously because you have a lot of university leadership here today and yesterday,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is a Hispanic-Serving Institution, meaning that more than a quarter of its students are Hispanic. Currently, 27 percent of UCSB students report that they are Hispanic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">“These reforms are for the 27 percent here to keep that 27 percent here,” said Jasmine Ortiz, first-year environmental studies major. “We already struggle coming from our communities to get here and then we have to struggle twice as hard to maintain our positions here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sit-down in El Centro, a building near the library that serves as a meeting place for several Latino student-advocacy groups, was direct and productive, with Marisela Márquez, the executive director of Associated Students, serving as a mediator between administrators and students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Administrators largely seemed open to the students’ demands, at one point remarking that none of VOCEROS’ requests seemed impossible. As the group went through the list, Márquez asked that administrators list barriers to completing the demands as well as solutions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most often, administrators said time and money are the main barriers hindering the completion of VOCEROS’ demands. For example, Maria Herrera-Sobek, the associate vice chancellor for diversity, equity and academic policy, said she was instrumental in creating a Chicano Department at UC Irvine, but that it took more than 15 years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">“It does take some time, but it is not impossible,” Herrera-Sobek said of creating a Central American major and department at UCSB. “You can start right away by having a committee of students and faculty and administrators exploring and identifying the courses that are out there already” that could fulfill the proposed major’s requirements.</span></p>\n<p>Garcia said there is a need for a Central America-specific department and major because Hispanic spaces on campus often focus on Mexican-Americans.</p>\n<p>“Within the Latinx community, we want to break the barriers between communities,” Garcia said, using a term designed to include Latino and Latina students and Hispanic students who do not identify within traditional gender roles.</p>\n<p>“Students feel like the Chicano Department and a lot of the other resources we have are very Mexican-centric,” Garcia said. “We’re not trying to pit departments against each other or trying to get resources from another department, but more-so trying to expand what we already have and be that 100 percent that we want to be.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the groups’ most feasible demands, according to administrators, is the institution of a Latinx Parents Weekend. Klawunn said she would work to add some of the proposed changes into the fall parents weekend, such as bilingual events and workshops oriented toward Latino parents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VOCEROS also had multiple demands relating to campus buildings. The group asked for a guarantee that El Centro would remain a permanent space for Latinx students and also requested that an existing building in Manzanita Village be designated for Latinx students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marc Fisher, a vice chancellor, said the university only plans to make routine modifications to the El Centro building over the next few decades.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can look out 5 or 10 or even 20 years and I can see what the next buildings are, and there are no plans for this site,” Fisher said.</span></p>\n<p>Administrators also responded in favor of dedicating an existing building in Manzanita Village to Latinx students. While housing is already determined for next year, Klawunn said, there could be a Latinx-specific building by fall 2017.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fisher said that while it can be “hard to build community” in Manzanita Village as opposed to the standard freshman dorms like Anacapa or San Nicolas, he didn’t think there would be much resistance to the Manzanita Village idea if that is what students desire.</span></p>\n<p>UCSB Police Chief Dustin Olson also attended the meeting, promising to meet with students and possibly other local police agencies by fall to discuss reducing the “footprint” of law enforcement at events like Deltopia or during Halloween.</p>\n<p>Olson also said the department will “definitely be committed and continue to be committed to sensitivity to gender and diversity” in hiring practices.</p>\n<p>Both students and administrators were willing to work with each other and appeared relieved by the productive nature of the talks.</p>\n<p>“It’s Saturday, we should be relaxing … but I’m here meeting with you all and that’s because these things are very important and these are things that affect people’s lives,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>“At other UCs you have to literally protest for days just to get [the administrators’] attention,” she continued. “So the fact that we didn’t have to do that is a blessing in my opinion.”</p>\n<p>The full list of VOCEROS demands is available as part of the group’s <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/chancellor-henry-yang-voceros-reforms?recruiter=308498257&amp;utm_source=share_for_starters&amp;utm_medium=copyLink\">online petition to Chancellor Yang.</a></p>\n<p><em>[Correction, May 23: An initial version of this article said students met with administrators in El Centro for three hours on Saturday.

UCSB, which has not been updated since 1995. Graduate students hope it will protect them from “abusing power.” <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB’s Graduate Student Association (GSA) is proposing a revised graduate student Bill of Rights for the first time since 1995 to protect graduate students from abuse and exploitation.</p>\n<p>The GSA passed the newly drafted Bill of Rights in its General Assembly meeting on April 5. Representatives submitted the draft to the Academic Senate on Monday and hope to present before the Senate’s Graduate Council soon.</p>\n<p>The Bill of Rights currently in action at UCSB was drafted and ratified in 1995. The University of California Student Association (UCSA) drafted a system-wide graduate student Bill of Rights in 2011 and UCSB’s GSA informally approved it soon after.</p>\n<p>GSA Vice President of Student Affairs Kathy Swift initiated the revised Bill of Rights in December and said she expanded upon UCSA’s 2011 Bill to make the new Bill. The 2011 Bill is about 20 pages long, and the recently passed draft is about 21 pages long.</p>\n<p>“I just basically beefed it up and expanded a couple parts that I thought were needing more support, more explanation,” Swift said.</p>\n<p>Swift said the new bill adds language allowing for the creation of a graduate student advocate position and a shared governance board. Her vision is that the graduate student advocate would be someone students could rely on to “negotiate through the bureaucracy” and resolve disputes.</p>\n<p>The shared governance board, Swift said, would be a group of student representatives, including the graduate student advocate, with voting power in the Academic Senate. Swift said members of the Academic Senate might be skeptical of allowing a shared governance board.</p>\n<p>“That’s a real touchy one,” Swift said. “That’s where we’re going to get into some negotiation.”</p>\n<p>According to Swift, the need for a revised Bill of Rights comes from the “touchy and more sensitive relationship” between graduate students and the university. She said academic departments typically consider graduate students as low‐level associates rather than colleagues.</p>\n<p>“We encounter situations where we’re exploited or we’re taken advantage of or we’re not respected,” Swift said. “That can really be destructive for our academic careers.”</p>\n<p>Timothy Irvine, GSA vice president of committees, helped Swift draft the bill and said advisers have strong influence over a graduate student’s professional life through letters of recommendation, networking and aid in publishing.</p>\n<p>Graduate students are “basically working under a group of like three to six people who have control over all of those things,” Irvine said. “So, if they decide to abuse their power, your ability to respond to that is extremely limited.”</p>\n<p>Irvine said the university currently has a process in place by which graduate students can respond to abuse, but he said these efforts are “akin to Band‐Aids on bullet holes.”</p>\n<p>“There is a method for adjudication, but it doesn’t necessarily work that well, and it doesn’t necessarily give people justice,” Irvine said.</p>\n<p>Yanira Rivas Pineda, the GSA external vice president, said having a graduate student Bill of Rights is necessary to help graduate students who are in dysfunctional relationships with their advisors.</p>\n<p>“As graduate students, we sacrifice our financial stability and basically put our life on hold for a few years,” Pineda said in an email. “The last thing we need is to have to navigate conflicts on our own with little to no support or guidance.”</p>\n<p>Swift said the 1995 Bill of Rights in action across the university, drafted in 1995, offers basic protections to graduate students, but is incomplete.</p>\n<p>“It is not comprehensive,” Swift said. “It doesn’t cover a lot of areas that graduate students need.”</p>\n<p>Swift said she needs to consult with the Academic Senate and the Graduate Division, otherwise the newly revised graduate student Bill of Rights will not be enforced.</p>\n<p>“[Graduate students] don’t have that much in the way of enforcement power at all, which is why it’s necessary for us to try to negotiate this with the Graduate Division and the Academic Senate,” Swift said. “They’re the ones that will make the enforcement.”</p>\n<p>Swift said representatives of the Academic Senate and the Graduate Division have already begun to express skepticism toward the new draft in her meetings with them.</p>\n<p>“This is going to cause problems,” Swift said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, April 14,

According to Pineda, UC Berkeley’s GSA drafted and passed a resolution in favor of GrADE and other UC graduate students hope to pass similar resolutions.</p>\n<p>“The campaign … addressed problems with the lack of faculty diversity (in all forms), finding adequate mentorship and faculty with research projects that reflect the 21st century graduate population,” Pineda said in an email.</p>\n<p>Iman Sylvain, UC Berkeley’s Graduate Assembly Vice President of External Affairs, said she helped write a resolution that endorses the full and permanent participation of graduate students in faculty hiring processes with equal rights to interview and provide input as faculty.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“This is 50 years after Jim Crow and the Civil Rights Act and somehow we still don’t have very many professors of color — kind of a problem.” — Timothy Irvine</p></blockquote>\n<p>“The UC acknowledges that it lags behind peer institutions in hiring women and underrepresented minorities,” Pineda said in an email. “We believe that having the next generation of faculty (those of us being trained to become professors) being part of the hiring process is [a] small but necessary step in democratizing the hiring process and our university.”</p>\n<p>According to Timothy Irvine, GSA’s Vice President of Committees and Planning and graduate student, a small percentage of tenured or tenured-track faculty are African American. He said having younger, more diverse people involved in hiring committees would play an important role in increasing diversity.</p>\n<p>“This is 50 years after Jim Crow and the Civil Rights Act and somehow we still don’t have very many professors of color — kind of a problem,” Irvine said. “Hiring committees are a big part of the solution to that problem.”</p>\n<p>Irvine also said having graduate students who are being taught by faculty on these committees would be a “very logical next step towards shared governance” between students and universities.</p>\n<p>Irvine said UCSB’s current system is “decentralized” and graduate student voices are heard differently in each department’s hiring process.</p>\n<p>“That is done in the name of academic freedom, but what you also get is like a patchwork of adherence to different conduct codes and legal codes,” Irvine said.</p>\n<p>Some GSA members expressed concern about the change creating too much pressure for graduate students who find themselves in disagreement with department faculty. Others questioned whether graduate students should have voting powers.</p>\n<p>“I believe that these concerns are precisely why we need to include graduate students in the hiring process,” Pineda said in an email. “Those of us who are going to stay in the academy should be able to experience the hiring process from the other side and not just when we’re out in the job market.”</p>\n<p>GSA members are in the process of modifying their initial draft, and will bring the resolution to a vote during a General Assembly Meeting on May 3.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this story misquoted Timothy Irvine as saying “Human Rights Act” instead of “Civil Rights Act.” The article has been updated accordingly. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69736\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gsa-resolution-aims-to-include-graduate-students-in-faculty-hiring-committees/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69736\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gsa-resolution-aims-to-include-graduate-students-in-faculty-hiring-committees/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gsa-resolution-aims-to-include-graduate-students-in-faculty-hiring-committees/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gsa-resolution-aims-to-include-graduate-students-in-faculty-hiring-committees/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gsa-resolution-aims-to-include-graduate-students-in-faculty-hiring-committees/","id":2504,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2503,2502,2501],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
