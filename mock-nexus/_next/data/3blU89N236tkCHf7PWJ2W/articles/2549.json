OPP was disbanded earlier this month as two new political parties, Campus United and the Peer Action Coalition, were created within the last week in an attempt to bring more diversity to the A.S. senate board. A Bill to Switch Associated Students Elections to a single transferable vote system the student elections system to a single transferrable vote (STV) process was passed in October and will go into effect this spring which will use ranking averages instead of singular votes to choose election winners.</p>\n<p>Dustin Larrazolo, PAC member and third-year biochemistry major, said PAC was created to provide “all-inclusive” and non-toxic spaces within A.S.</p>\n<p>“We want to bring everyone home to A.S. I want to open up these spaces so that the people can tell us what to do,” Larrazolo said. “The students are the leaders and we [senate] are the vote. I’m strong proponent of that and democratic caucuses.”</p>\n<p>Nushi Yapabandara, PAC member and second-year philosophy, psychology and sociology triple major, said the goal of the Peer Action Coalition is to create a safe and accepting space for students of all backgrounds to experience A.S.</p>\n<p>“We want to ensure every Gaucho feels that they can have their voice heard through our group, whether it’s them wanting to actively help us with campaigning or if it’s them addressing concerns with future candidates,” Yapabandara said.</p>\n<p>Niki Elyasi, Campus United member and third-year biopsychology major, said Campus United was created to put students first as they are the party’s priority.</p>\n<p>“We are all about the student experience and improving it the best that we can and taking action on clear consensus student issues that would benefit all of us,” Elyasi said. “So we are really a student-focused, student-run movement looking to get involved in A.S.”</p>\n<p>Elyasi said Campus United was created to bring more diversity to senate.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to get a voice out that we feel hasn’t been heard as vocally and that’s the voice of the students for improved resources and academic distinction on campus,” Elyasi said.</p>\n<p>According to Yapabandara, the purpose of the PAC is to give UCSB students from diverse backgrounds a chance to be represented by senators who identify with them.</p>\n<p>“Up until now, A.S. has been a very particular type of UCSB student,” Yapabandara said. “As someone who was a campaign manager for one of the two major political parties last year, I remember feeling very left out because the students Senate has had in the past were of a particular social group.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo said PAC is comprised of student leaders from Senate, the Office of Student Life, Resident Hall Council and various other student groups to give the party.</p>\n<p>“A.S. programs only benefits about 20 percent of students and we strive to expand that through collaborations with Office of Student Life Organizations, the Residence Halls Association and student clubs to let students understand what resources are available,” Larrazolo said. “We strive to have the multiplicity representative of our university because every student is a part of A.S. I don’t think only 23 people should handle 11 million dollars.”</p>\n<p>Yapabandara said she was unable to run with the Open People’s Party last year despite her desire to run for an A.S. political office.</p>\n<p>“It was very discouraging because I wanted to help make change at the university but did not have the necessary connections to even be able to run with the party,” Yapabandara said.</p>\n<p>Ashcon Minoiefar, Campus United member and third-year history of public policy major, said one party cannot adequately represent the student body.</p>\n<p>“I think that it was an inevitable thing where you can’t just have one group that tries to represent everybody because no matter how holistic, how genuine you try to be, it just doesn’t really work,” Minoiefar said.</p>\n<p>Jimmy Villarreal, A.S. President and fourth-year history of public policy major, said the formation of new parties would be healthy for senate and for the campus.</p>\n<p>“I definitely think it is good to have competition. Competition breeds excellence. Complacency breeds mediocrity,” Villareal said.</p>\n<p>Minoiefar said he encourages students to form other political parties that represent them and their values.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to start something new in hopes that other people would continue to make new parties,” Minoiefar said. “We’re hoping that other parties can come up and have their focuses too, so that the parties are more representative of a variety of interest at the school.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo said one goal of PAC is to institutionalize education reform to exercise A.S.’s one third-power within university spaces.</p>\n<p>“Students will be able to address their concerns more effectively. Since Academic Affairs Board was disbanded, we have no central power with regard to our academics. What’s the point of A.S. when you can’t even lobby or express concerns in our education when A.S. isn’t there to represent them effectively.”</p>\n<p>Yapabandara said PAC wants to educate students on the resources available to them since many students do not understand what their student fees fund.</p>\n<p>“We also want to make sure Gauchos know the benefits they can receive from A.S. so that they can utilize their resources on and off campus as necessary,” Yapabandara said.</p>\n<p>Minoiefar said Campus United will be focusing on preventing additional student fee increases.</p>\n<p>“We have the highest fees by far out of all the UC’s but we don’t have necessarily an extreme amount of services compared to some other schools,” Minoiefar said. “I think a large focus is to ensure that what we currently take from students is being paid well and also that students are aware of where the money goes.”</p>\n<p>Minoiefar said A.S. does not have much control over what programs and institutions are funded.</p>\n<p>“Over here our student fees pay for the UCen, they pay for the MCC, they pay for the Rec Cen, they pay for a great deal of stuff that people don’t know they’re being paid for but we have a lot less control,” Minoiefar said.</p>\n<p>Yapabandara said she is eager to see what happens during the elections because of the multiple parties.</p>\n<p>“I am very excited to see what will happen in this year’s elections because there are so many more parties who are also focusing on other parts of the student population, combined with the new STV system,” Yapabandara said.</p>\n<p>Minoiefar said has high hopes for the party’s future come spring elections.</p>\n<p>“I’m very confident in people wanting to join our party and seeing what we have to offer but I do think it will have contributed to a healthier association and a healthier campus,” Minoiefar said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Feb. 11, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>[Correction: This story originally quotes Larrazolo as saying “We want to bring everyone home from A.S.

Tuesday evening titled “Second Class Feminists?: The Changing Role of Women in Faith Communities” for panelists and audience members to discuss the intersections of religion and feminism and the role of feminists in religions with patriarchal interpretations.</p>\n<p>The event, which took place at the MultiCultural Center Theater, featured a panel of three feminist scholars of the Catholic, Muslim and Jewish faiths. Panelists included Gina Messina-Dysert, Dean of the School of Graduate and Professional Studies at Ursuline College, Nia Malika Dixon, author, filmmaker and founder of Audaz Entertainment and Rabbi Tamara Cohen, Director of Innovation at Moving Traditions. All three panelists are contributors to <em>Faithfully Feminist</em>, a collection of 45 essays on feminism in religion, for which they held a signing after the event.</p>\n<p>Kathleen Moore, religious studies professor and department chair at UCSB, said although religion and feminism are not inherently opposed, there is conflict generated by people’s expectations that an opposition exists.</p>\n<p>“They are not an either-or dichotomy, although the conflict between religion and feminism is real,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>Messina-Dysert said it is harmful for nonreligious feminists to discount the work of religious feminists, because the success of feminism depends on working together and mutual support between the two.</p>\n<p>“Individuals who identify as religious and feminists receive a lot of judgment, if you will, from both their religious communities and from feminists,” Messina-Dysert said. “I personally find both damaging, but I find judgment from feminists more damaging.”</p>\n<p>Messina-Dysert offered her definition of feminism, which she said is inspired by those of Bell Hooks and Rosemary Radford Ruether.</p>\n<p>“I like to talk about feminism as being a movement that is focused on eradicating sexism, yes, but all oppression, because you cannot uproot one without uprooting all,” she said.</p>\n<p>Religion needs feminism, according to Messina-Dysert, as it is still inundated with patriarchal interpretations that lead to oppression.</p>\n<p>“Certainly it is necessary for feminism to be a critical part of religious practice,” Messina-Dysert said. “We need to continue to acknowledge the great oppressions that still exist within religious traditions and find the ways that we can create healing.”</p>\n<p>Messina-Dysert spoke specifically about Catholicism to exemplify oppressive religious traditions such as the Vatican’s resistance to reproductive rights and women’s ordination. She said women are a “blind spot” of Pope Francis, who upholds the “theology of complementarity,” which declares a woman’s purpose and value come from her role as a wife and mother.</p>\n<p>Such traditions are not inherently part of religion and should be resisted, according to Messina-Dysert.</p>\n<p>“Certainly, the foundations of religion are not sexist — it’s the interpretations that are,” she said. “Feminism allows us to work toward disrupting those problematic interpretations.”</p>\n<p>Malika Dixon said she believes God gives her the right to stand up for both feminism and religion even though many interpretations hold them in contention.</p>\n<p>“Asking a Muslim ‘why are you feminist?’ to me seems kind of misinformed, because to me, as a Muslim, I believe we are automatically feminist,” Malika Dixon said. “The patriarchy that pervades our religious beliefs is not a part of our beliefs, it’s an interpretation.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68035\" style=\"width: 810px\"

traditions such as the unequal status of bat mitzvahs and bar mitzvahs, which she experienced in her conservative synagogue and orthodox school while growing up.</p>\n<p>“Girls could have a bat mitzvah, but not equal to a bar mitzvah,” Cohen said. “We could read from the Torah only on Friday night, which doesn’t really count, and not on Saturday morning.”</p>\n<p>Cohen said her family chose to have a bar mitzvah for her despite the orthodoxy of her synagogue and school, empowering her to fight for feminist reforms to Jewish tradition.</p>\n<p>“I had this sense with the way we did it that if something wasn’t fair out there we could change it,” Cohen said. “It wasn’t many years later that a lot of places began to say, yes, you can do it on Saturday morning, and that change happened because women demanded it and feminists demanded it.”</p>\n<p>Cohen said she had a crisis of faith after coming out as a lesbian in college, because conservative Judaism did not allow for ordination of LGBT Rabbis, which lead her to a new understanding of feminism.</p>\n<p>“It really shook me to my core and made me think about ‘what is feminism all about?’ and ‘who is it for?’ and ‘what are the limits of a certain feminism and how do we have to push it forward?’” Cohen said.</p>\n<p>She said she has struggled to assert both her feminist and her Jewish identity due to the popular notion that they are at odds.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to be accepted as what a certain image of what a feminist was and in some sense a certain aesthetic of what a cool dyke was in that moment of the early 90s,” Cohen said. “In some sense I wanted to go underground as a religious person because I couldn’t feel the two together.”</p>\n<p>Cohen said she uses “feminine God-language” in order to unravel the core of many patriarchal religious interpretations.</p>\n<p>“If our images in terms of the ultimate power of the universe and the language we use is only male … it becomes enshrined,” she said.</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Evelyn Cabral said she strongly agreed with everything the panel members said during the event.</p>\n<p>“Everything to do with feminism and religion is a choice, and the intersectionality between the two of them and the parallels between the two to them,” Cabral said.</p>\n<p>Cabral said she chose to attend the event because it brought together “two good parts” of her life, referring to religion and feminism.</p>\n<p>“Usually it is hard to find events that bring these two parts of your life together. It’s usually either religion or feminism. It’s never both of them together, so that’s why I wanted to come to this event,” Cabral said.</p>\n<p>Mariam Tariq, second-year global studies and political science double major, said as a Muslim feminist she related to many of the experiences the panel discussed.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been feeling a lot of conflict about what is a woman’s role within religion,” Tariq said. “This event seemed like a good way to listen to scholars and hear what they have to say, and I thought it was really enlightening and it was a reaffirmation of everything that I believe and it’s amazing to see other women of different faiths also struggling with the same issues.”</p>\n<p>Tariq said she would like to see more events that combine feminism and faith, which are usually kept in different spheres on campus.</p>\n<p>“I think religion on campus is sort of a touchy subject. Not many people bring it up and there’s very limited spaces where you can bring it up,” Tariq said. “I don’t see this much on campus where you get to see women fighting as feminists and for their religions.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68050\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/second-class-feminists-event-fosters-discussion-on-feminism-and-religion/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68050\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/second-class-feminists-event-fosters-discussion-on-feminism-and-religion/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/second-class-feminists-event-fosters-discussion-on-feminism-and-religion/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/second-class-feminists-event-fosters-discussion-on-feminism-and-religion/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/second-class-feminists-event-fosters-discussion-on-feminism-and-religion/","id":2548,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[2547,2546,2545],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
